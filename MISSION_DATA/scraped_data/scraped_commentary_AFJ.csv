|The Apollo 16 mission is the eleventh flight in the Apollo/Saturn V flight program, the sixth mission planned for lunar landing, and the fourth mission planned for landing in the lunar highlands. It is the second of the three 'J' Mission series which take advantage of greater Saturn V performance to launch a heavier spacecraft dedicated to scientific exploration of the Moon. The crew is John W. Young (Mission Commander), Tom "Ken" Mattingly II (Command Module Pilot), and Charles M. Duke, Jr. (Lunar Module Pilot). John Young is by this time the most experienced American astronaut still flying, having been the co-pilot on <i>Gemini III</i> (the first manned Gemini flight), the command pilot of <i>Gemini X</i> and the Command Module Pilot (CMP) for <i>Apollo 10</i>, the dress rehearsal for <i>Apollo 11</i>. Both Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke are rookies. Mattingly was previously been designated as the CMP for <i>Apollo 13</i> but was grounded 72 hours before that mission due to exposure to German Measles. Duke had been the back-up LMP for <i>Apollo 13</i> (incidentally, it was Duke's case of German Measles that led to Mattingly's grounding).
|The mission is also termed AS-511 (Apollo Saturn V number 11), and, in part due to the rivalries between the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston (now Johnston Space Center) which is responsible for the spacecraft and the Marshall Space Flight Centre at Huntsville, which is responsible for the Saturn V, it is sometimes termed SA-511. The launch vehicle comprises First Stage S-IC-11 (the eleventh production stage), Second Stage S-II-11, Third Stage S-IVB-511, and Instrument Unit IUS-511 (both the eleventh of each for the Saturn V). The Apollo Spacecraft comprises Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter SLA-20 (the twentieth production unit), Command Module CM-113 and Service Module SM-113 (the thirteenth of the Block 2 version of each), and Lunar Module LM-11. The LM houses Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV-2.
|Originally slated for launch on 17 March 1972, Apollo 16 is now prepared to go on 16 April, as the culmination of a long preparation. The crew assignments were formally announced over a year ago on 3 March 1971, and the elements of the spacecraft began to arrive at the Kennedy Space Centre in July 1971. Apollo 16's preparation has not been without incident. In mid-November, the three main parachutes had to be replaced after the failure of a connector link left Apollo 15 with only two of its three parachutes operative at splashdown. On 13 December 1970 the combined "stack" of the Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V were moved from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to Launch Pad 39A. However, a mistake during subsequent testing resulted in the bursting of one of the teflon bladders that contained the hypergolic fuel in the Command Module's Reaction Control System (RCS). Since the test had used helium gas rather than the actual fuel, there was only limited damage. However, the replacement of the RCS tank was required which in turn needed disturbance of the CM heatshield (Moonport p518). A further problem was the need to change one of the explosive cords that separate the LM from the CSM prior to Earth return. A failure in a similar device during testing for Skylab raised concerns over that fitted to Apollo 16, and it was decided to replace it (AWST 10 Jan 72 p21, 17 Jan 72 p19). These 2 problems led to the decision to return the stack to the VAB for the first time in the Apollo program. A third problem was a delay in modifying the crew's spacesuits after Charles Duke's suffered failure of a clamp during training. As a result of all 3 problems, the launch date has been slipped from 17 March to 16 April, the next launch window for the mission. The timing of an Apollo launch to the Moon falls within certain 'windows', or periods of time, which are influenced by both daily and monthly factors. The daily restriction to the window is due to the rotation of the Earth bringing the launch site to the correct relationship with the Moon's position in its orbit, to allow enough of a parking orbit around the Earth before the boost to the Moon. The monthly factor is the lighting requirements at the landing site. The landing has to take place in the early lunar morning so that the Sun is behind the astronauts as they approach from their east-to-west orbit. A low Sun-angle produces shadows on the lunar terrain which help the crew to recognize landmarks as well as aiding speed and distance perception. With a lunar day lasting 29.5 Earth days, the correct conditions for the landing only occur once a month.
|There are 3 separate recording transcripts available of the mission at this point. These are the Technical Air To Ground Voice (TEC) Transcription, which documents all radio communication between Mission Control and the spacecraft and which has been carefully transcribed. The second is the Public Affairs Office (PAO) Transcript which was produced at the time from the public feed of the mission audio. It includes commentary from the occupant of the PAO console in Mission Control as well as much radio communication. Having been transcribed in a hurry by stenographers for use by journalists, it is very prone to errors. The third recording is the Command Module Onboard Voice (CM) Transcription. This is recorded on the Data Recorder Reproducer (DRR) - a tape recorder with 2,200 feet of tape giving 4 hours of recording at Low rate, or 60 minutes at High, fitted in the Command Module Lower Equipment Bay. The recorder is switched on during powered flight and during times that the spacecraft is out of contact with the ground. It can then be played back and transmitted to the ground. It can also be used to record data from some of the scientific experiments carried. The voice recordings from the DRR are not continuous throughout the flight. However, for the periods they are available, the CM transcriptions give a real insight into the crew's informal discussion and chat. Readers should note that if an utterance by a crewmember is listed as "onboard", the ground crews are not hearing it live at that time. They will be able to hear the onboard voice after they have replayed it to Earth during a regular dump of the tape. There are minor differences between the transcriptions, partly as the crew's discussions could mask off Mission Control reception. Also, the quality of the tapes makes the transcription process subjective at times.
|The weather on 16 April 1972 is good, with a ridge of high pressure extending over Florida from the east. By mid morning the skies are clear with scattered cumulus clouds developing by 11 am. The surface temperature is climbing to 88°F (31°C).
|Before the launch, the spacecraft has to be finally prepared for flight. This is carried out using the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#BackupPrelaunch" target="afj">Operational Procedures</a> detailed in the Apollo Operations Handbook, and will leave the control positions as detailed in the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section1" target="afj">CSM Launch Checklist</a>. The lift-off configuration is set and verified by the back-up Command Module Pilot (CMP), in this case Stu Roosa who was the CMP on Apollo 14. He checks that each switch, knob, adjustment and talkback indicator is correctly set for the arrival of the prime crew. The CSM Launch Checklist systematically covers each of the 57 panels in the Apollo 16 CSM. There are 454 lines in the checklist. Some panels were covered by a single line, while Panel 2 on the main display console requires 78 lines.
|At first glance, the Main Display Console of the Command Module is highly complex. However, it is also highly structured, with all the controls for the various systems grouped together, and positioned where they will be visible and accessible during flight. The complexity of the controls is a reflection of the complexity of the spacecraft – the Apollo spacecraft is arguably one of the most complex flying machines ever created – before or since. Compared to aircraft cockpits, the main difference is the need to group all the controls where the crew can reach them while strapped into their seats and wearing spacesuits. The number of instruments is less than on many aircraft – much of the monitoring function carried out by an aircraft's crew is performed by the controllers on the ground at Kennedy Space Center or in Houston. Many of the displays also have multiple functions – for example displaying one parameter during launch and another later in the flight. Almost all are analogue instruments, with few digital displays. The crew has full control of all the systems, however, unlike their counterparts on Soviet spacecraft. Hence, the large number of switches and other controls. As former fast-jet pilots, the crew are already well accustomed to working in such an environment, but the complexity of Apollo has required many hours of work in the simulator to learn to &quot;fly&quot; the craft in an emergency.
|Three hours before launch, the prime crew enters the spacecraft and once settled, they continue the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#PrimePrelaunch" target="afj">Pre-Launch Checks</a>. CDR (Commander), John Young, has taken the left couch facing the major flight controls and the abort handle. CMP Ken Mattingly occupies the centre couch, facing the caution and warning panel and ready to monitor the computer's display during the critical minutes of ascent. The electrical and environment systems will be monitored during launch by the LMP (Lunar Module Pilot), Charlie Duke, who sits in the right couch. The checklist for boost preparation will be performed starting at T - 20 minutes.
-01:30:00|The introduction of a mixed nitrogen/oxygen cabin atmosphere was a design change after the <i>Apollo 1</i> fire. Apollo is designed for a cabin pressure of 6 psi in space, to provide sufficient oxygen for the crew to operate without spacesuits. Since the actual amount of oxygen they breathe is determined by the partial pressure of oxygen (the contribution to the total cabin pressure provided by the oxygen alone), this 60/40 mix provides a little more oxygen than the 20 percent oxygen content of air at a sea level pressure of 15 psi (1 bar). However, the crew are wearing their spacesuits with the helmets closed and are breathing pure oxygen to flush out the nitrogen in their blood. In the event of a sudden loss of pressure in the spacecraft, any residual nitrogen dissolved in their blood would come out of solution and cause the "bends". The suit pressure is slightly more than cabin pressure to prevent any flow of cabin air into the suit. After launch, the cabin pressure relief valve will bleed air out of the cabin until the external pressure falls to 6 psi (0.4 bar) or equivalent to about 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) altitude on Earth. The environmental control system will continue to pump 0.6 pounds per hour (0.27 kg per hour) of oxygen into the cabin until the crew close the Direct O<sub>2</sub> valve after orbit is reached, and until then the pressure relief valve will dump the excess cabin air overboard. The aim is to reach orbit with minimal nitrogen in the cabin atmosphere.
-01:20:00|The pad crew is led by Guenter Wendt, the long serving North American employee who has served in a similar capacity on all manned US space missions since Alan Shepard's flight on <i>Mercury Redstone 3</i>.
-01:10:00|The Q-ball is not unlike a pitot tube on an aircraft that measures airspeed. It consists of eight openings at the top of the Launch Escape Tower. These openings lead to instruments which gauge air pressure. As well as providing dynamic pressure (known as "Q") information during powered flight, they help determine the angle of incidence of the tower during an abort event. The Q-ball design works at almost all air-speeds, unlike the pitot-static instruments used on most aircraft. A similar type of Q-ball was fitted to NASA's hypersonic X-15 research aircraft made, like the CSM, by North American in Downey, California. The Q-ball is covered until shortly before launch, to prevent blockage of the holes.
-01:01:00|The spacecraft has two independent systems that can control its attitude and fire its engines. The Guidance &amp; Control system is the more sophisticated, relying on a gyroscopically stabilized inertial platform and an optical subsystem. The SCS (Stabilization and Control System) uses simpler systems like strapped-down gyroscopes to achieve attitude control.
-01:00:00|A generation after Apollo, Gene Kranz, fondly nicknamed "General Savage" became the most celebrated of the Apollo-era flight directors. In the early 1990s, he gave an interview for a television documentary about the trials of the near disastrous <i>Apollo 13</i> mission. In his contribution, the hard-looking NASA technocrat with angular jaw and close-cropped hair expressed a deep emotional attachment to his flight control teams as his story of success in the face of failure brought tears to his eyes. The interview was brought to the attention of the production team for the movie film Apollo 13 who cast Ed Harris in the role of Kranz. Harris brought the mixture of steely leadership and team sensitivity to the character. The movie film portrays one of Kranz's rituals whereby his wife would make a white waistcoat for Gene for each flight, white being the team colour Gene chose for his flight control team.
-00:54:00|Although the RP-1 (kerosene) fuel for the S-IC was loaded some time before, the oxygen and hydrogen propellants must be loaded shortly before launch, since they will boil-off despite the insulation on the tanks. The loading procedure is complex. Air and water vapor is purged from the tanks by repeated pressurization and venting with helium. Helium is used because nitrogen would freeze in the presence of liquid hydrogen. Once clear of contaminants, the tanks are cooled to accept the propellants by first passing cold gas through the system then feeding propellant at a slow rate and allowing it to boil off, taking heat with it. Seven hours before launch, LOX is fed at 31.5 litres per second until it is 5% full, then the fill rate goes to 315 litres per second to take the tank to 96% full. This takes about 25 minutes and then the tank is topped up at 63 litres per second. Five hours before launch and after purging and cooling, LH<sub>2</sub> enters at 63 litres per second, further cooling its tank so that propellant begins to remain liquid and rise in level in a process similar to that for the LOX tanks. Once the level of liquid propellant reaches 5 percent, the fill rate is increased to 630 litres per second until the tank is 98 percent full, when the fill rate reduces again to 63 litres per second to top off the tank's load. To compensate for loss due to boil-off, both tanks are replenished until about three minutes before launch when the tanks are pressurized. Up to the launch, pressurizing helium gas is supplied from the ground. After launch, the boil-off of the propellants is enough to maintain pressure until the engines are ignited 2 minutes and 40 seconds into the flight.
-00:43:00|This is a test of the Saturn V's batteries. The spacecraft fuel cells were started before the prime crew entered the CM, and were brought on-line (connected to the power distribution bus-bars) during the earlier pre-launch checks.
-00:40:00|Each stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle has shaped explosive charges attached to its outer surface which, in the event of an abort, would rupture the fuel and oxidizer tanks, dispersing their contents into the atmosphere rather than allow them to impact the Earth with dangerous loads still onboard. The charge for the S-IC would cut a longitudinal breach in the fuel tank on the opposite side of the vehicle from that for the oxidizer tank so as to minimize their mixing during dispersion. Charges for the S-II would cut a 9-metre longitudinal opening in the hydrogen fuel tank and a series of lateral 4-metre ruptures in the squat LOX (liquid oxygen) tank. Those for the S-IVB would make two parallel 6-metre openings in the fuel tank and a 1.2-metre diameter hole in the LOX tank. These charges would be fired only after the Command Module separated from the launch vehicle. During a normal ascent, the destruct system will be made safe soon after the Launch Escape Tower is jettisoned; after about 3½ minutes of flight.
-00:40:00|Early in the Apollo program, the Air Force had insisted that the LM, a vehicle from which every ounce of unneeded weight had been trimmed and which would be a home to men on the lunar surface, also had to have destruct ordnance attached. This was based on the premise that, in the event of a launch abort, it was better for propellants to be consumed before reaching the ground. After all, the LM would be unmanned at this stage. NASA pointed out the weight and safety penalties of this arrangement and eventually won what was a substantial argument by pointing out that the LM was hardly likely to survive the destruction of the S-IVB stage anyway. A similar conflict occurred over demands by the Air Force that the Service Module also carry destruct charges.
-00:35:00|The Saturn V launch vehicle is assembled, transported on, and launched from the Mobile Launcher. This structure consists of a base platform 48.8 by 41.1 metres and 7.6 metres high, with a 13.7-metre square hole over which the vehicle is mounted. (The platforms will later be converted for use by the Space Shuttle). Sprouting from one end of this platform is the LUT (Launch Umbilical Tower). This 116-metre tower supports nine swing arms which provide the ground crew with access points to the vehicle, and a wide range of services including fuel, LOX, hydraulics, electrical power and various gases for purging and pressurisation. These arms are articulated so they can swing away from the vehicle to give it clearance as it rises, and to protect them from the rocket's white hot exhaust gases. The crew enter the spacecraft via the top, or ninth, arm, which carries an environmentally controlled room at its end. Known as the "white room", it covers the CM hatch until the crew is aboard. At T-43 minutes, it was swung away from the spacecraft by 12°. Five minutes before launch, it will be retracted to 180°, on the opposite side of the tower from the Saturn V.
000:03:27|Once the ninth arm and white room are clear, at about T minus 43 minutes, the crew lock their shoulder harnesses and John Young arms the Launch Escape System (LES). In event of an emergency the crew will then have the option to use the LES to launch the CM alone, away from the pad. See description at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#lesdesc" target="afj">000:03:27</a> for the details of the LES.
-00:25:00|Two days before launch, a software problem was found during a test of one of the Emergency Detection System (EDS) gyros fitted to the Saturn V's IU. Although this was reviewed and the decision made launch “as-is”, a further special test of the EDS gyro was carried out on the morning of launch. During the test, the signal output of the Control Signal Processor (CSP), used for the rate gyro used for the IU's yaw control backup system, fell below that expected for approximately 1.9 secs. The CSP output then recovered and the fault could not be duplicated. The fault was attributed to a fault in one transistor fitted in the CSP. The gyro affected was a backup, used only when the IU's primary and reference gyro outputs disagreed. Analysis indicated that the Saturn V would still be controllable even if the pre-launch failure recurred, and the decision was made to continue the countdown as scheduled. (Saturn V Launch Vehicle Flight Evaluation Report 3.2.4)
-00:25:00|Of the 110.6-metre height of the entire Apollo 16/Saturn V stack, 42.1 metres comprise the S-IC first stage. Five F-1 engines are clustered at the bottom of the stage to provide 34,025 kN (7,700,000 pounds) of thrust in total. The propellants used are RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly refined kerosene) as the fuel and LOX as the oxidizer. The lower of two tanks is filled with 810,000 litres of RP-1 at T minus 13 hours with a final topping up occurring at T minus 1 hour. At nine hours before launch, the larger upper tank has nitrogen gas pumped through it to purge it of air and water vapor contaminants. Six and a half hours before launch, it is precooled to prepare it for the loading of 1.3 million litres of LOX at a temperature of -183°C. Initially, the LOX is fed at a slow rate of 95 litres per second until the tank is sufficiently chilled to retain the liquid up to 6.5% full, then the tank is filled to 98% at a rate of 630 litres per second, a process lasting over 45 minutes. The slow fill rate is reestablished until the tank is full at about 4 hours 55 minutes before launch. From then on, until three minutes before launch, the level is replenished as the volatile LOX boils off. Both of the first stage tanks are then pressurized prior to launch using helium; the fuel tank at T minus 96 seconds, the LOX tank at T minus 72 seconds.
-00:25:00|At T-20:00 the crew move onto the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section2" target="afj">Boost Preparation</a> procedures in the CSM Launch Checklist. See also <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#Page4-51" target="afj">Page 4-51</a> of the Operational Procedures.
-00:15:00|<a name="sii"></a>The second, or S-II, stage of Apollo 16's Saturn V vehicle is 24.9 metres tall and is powered by the combustion of LH<sub>2</sub> (liquid hydrogen) and LOX in a cluster of five J-2 rocket motors which generate a total thrust of 5,115kN (1.15 million pounds). A million litres of LH<sub>2</sub>, cooled to -253°C to get it into a liquid state, is loaded into the large, upper tank of the stage while 331,000 litres of LOX is loaded into the smaller, squat tank below. These tanks share a single insulated structure with only an insulated, common bulkhead between them. With both propellants being so cold - LH<sub>2</sub> is only 20 degrees above absolute zero - the tanks must be prepared and chilled down before they can be filled.
-00:10:00|The crew have, in accordance with tradition, named their 2 spacecraft. With a fine blend of humor and feeling, the Command Module was named <i>Casper</i> by Ken Mattingly, after the cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost while the Lunar Module was named <i>Orion</i>, after the constellation. In the words of Charlie Duke "it is a prominent constellation and easy to pronounce and transmit to Mission Control." A further issue was that the names had to sound very different, so that they could not be confused even in event of radio interference.
-00:04:00|The guidance alignment reported by the PAO is the final crew action before launch. The Flight Director Attitude Indicator (FDAI), or "eight-ball", is aligned to the precise attitude of the launch site, at the time of launch, with respect to the stars (the "frame of reference" used for this alignment). At launch, the FDAI will display roll, 180° (launch azimuth of 90° plus 90°); pitch, 90°; yaw, 0°.
-00:00:15|Ignition starts at 9 seconds before lift-off. The ignition sequence of an F-1 engine is a complicated affair with many interrelated events happening almost simultaneously.
-00:00:15|<a name="f1desc"></a>First, a description of the engine. A large combustion chamber and bell-shaped thrust chamber have an injector plate at the top, through which RP-1 fuel and LOX are injected at high pressure. Above the injector is the LOX dome which also transmits the force of the thrust from the engine to the rocket's structure. A single-shaft turbopump is mounted beside the combustion chamber. The turbine is at the bottom and is driven by the exhaust gas from burning RP-1 and LOX in a fuel-rich mixture in a gas generator. After powering the turbine, the exhaust gas passes through a heat exchanger, then to a wrap-around exhaust manifold which feeds it into the periphery of the engine bell. The final task for these hot gases is to cool and protect the nozzle extension from the far hotter exhaust of the main engine itself. Above the turbine, on the same shaft, is the fuel pump. It has two inlets from the fuel tank and two outlets going, via shutoff valves, to the injector plate. A line from one of these 'feeds' supplies the gas generator with fuel. Fuel is also used within the engine as a lubricant and as a hydraulic working fluid, though before launch, RJ-1 ramjet fuel is supplied from the ground for this purpose. At the top of the turbopump shaft is the LOX pump with a single, large inlet in-line with the turboshaft axis. This pump also has two outlet lines, with valves, to feed the injector plate. One line also supplies LOX to the gas generator. The interior lining of the combustion chamber and engine bell consists of a myriad of pipework through which a large portion of the fuel supply is fed. This cools the chamber and bell structure while also pre-warming the fuel. Lastly, an igniter, containing a cartridge of hypergolic fluid with burst diaphragms at either end, is in the high pressure fuel circuit and has its own inject point in the combustion chamber. This fluid is triethylboron with 10-15% triethylaluminium.
-00:00:15|<a name="f1start"></a>At T minus 8.9 seconds, a signal from the automatic sequencer fires four pyrotechnic devices. Two initiate combustion within the gas generator while another two cause the fuel-rich turbine exhaust gas to ignite when it enters the engine bell. Links are burned away by these igniters to generate an electrical signal to move the start solenoid. The start solenoid directs hydraulic pressure from the ground supply to open the main LOX valves. LOX begins to flow through the LOX pump, starting it to rotate, then into the combustion chamber. The opening of both LOX valves also causes a valve to allow fuel and LOX into the gas generator, where they ignite and accelerate the turbine. Fuel and LOX pressures rise as the turbine gains speed. The fuel-rich exhaust from the gas generator ignites in the engine bell to prevent backfiring and burping of the engine. The increasing pressure in the fuel lines opens a valve, the igniter fuel valve, letting fuel pressure reach the hypergolic cartridge which promptly ruptures. Hypergolic fluid, followed by fuel, enters the chamber through its port where it spontaneously ignites on contact with the LOX already in the chamber.
-00:00:15|Rising combustion-induced pressure on the injector plate actuates the ignition monitor valve, directing hydraulic fluid to open the main fuel valves. These are the valves in the fuel lines between the turbopump and the injector plate. The fuel flushes out ethylene glycol which had been preloaded into the cooling pipework around the combustion chamber and nozzle. The heavy load of ethylene glycol mixed with the first injection of fuel slows the buildup of thrust, giving a gentler start. Fluid pressure through calibrated orifices completes the opening of the fuel valves and fuel enters the combustion chamber where it burns in the already flaming gases. The exact time that the main fuel valves open is sequenced across the five engines to spread the rise in applied force that the structure of the rocket must withstand.
-00:00:05|As fuel and LOX flow increase to maximum, the rise in chamber pressure, and therefore thrust, is monitored to confirm that the required force has been achieved. With the turbopump at full speed, fuel pressure exceeds hydraulic pressure supplied from ground equipment. Check valves switch the engine's hydraulic supply to be fed from the rocket's fuel instead of from the ground.
-00:00:02|At lift-off, one of the most important areas of the main display console that the commander must monitor is the subpanel which annunciates the progress of the launch. From top to bottom, this subpanel contains the Abort light, Mission Event Timer, Launch Vehicle Engine lights, lift-off light and critical switches (with safety covers) that are used to override the automatic abort sequences.
000:00:00|The stack is held onto the pad two ways. Four hold-down arms clamp the base of the S-IC, each with a force of 350 tonnes, anchoring the vehicle until full thrust is confirmed. A pneumatic device, backed up by an explosive, collapses the lever linkage to allow the arm to rise. Additionally, a number of controlled-release mechanisms (up to 16, depending on the mission) prevent the vehicle from accelerating too rapidly in the first moments of motion. These consist of tapered pins mounted to the pad which are pulled through dies mounted on the vehicle. The deformation of the pins controls the initial acceleration for the first 150 mm of flight; a simple and ingenious arrangement.
000:00:00|With lift off, the crew move to <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-7" target="afj">Page 2-7</a> of the Launch Checklist, and <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#Boost" target="afj">Page 4-55</a> of the Operational Procedures.
000:00:00|Once the launch vehicle begins to rise, even fractionally, it cannot safely settle back onto the pad. Intentional engine shutdown will not occur, so of the nine access arms, the five which have remained attached up to this point, must now detach their umbilicals from the vehicle and swing clear. The first two centimetres of travel trigger the release of the umbilical connector plates which in turn triggers retraction of the arms.
000:00:06|On this, and all Saturn V launches, the stack can easily be seen leaning away from the LUT as it ascends from the launch pad. This yaw, begun 1.35 seconds after lift-off, maneuvers the vehicle 1.25&deg; from vertical in a direction away from the tower to ensure clearance in case a gust of wind pushes it back or a swing arm doesn't fully retract. Then nine seconds into the flight, almost as the rising rocket clears the tower, the stack is brought vertical again. To those who were not prepared for it, this fully intended yawing of over 110 metres of metal, filled to the brim with exotic fuels and oxidizers, could sometimes cause some consternation. The astronauts were also very aware that any guidance or engine steering control failure could cause a collision with the tower which would probably not have been survivable even with the Launch Escape System. On Apollo 16 there is minor anomaly in the maneuver, which is completed about 1 second late. This is due to a software glitch in the launch vehicle guidance system located in the Instrument Unit. Although not a major fault, it could have decreased the clearance from the tower and the IU computer will be reprogrammed for the Apollo 17 and Skylab launches.
000:00:12|Once the stack is clear of the tower, control of the mission switches from the Launch Control Center (LCC) at the Cape under the Launch Director, to the Mission Control Center (MCC) in Houston where the Flight Director is in charge.
000:00:21|The guidance of the launch vehicleis monitored and controlled by the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer in the IU and its programs, and not by the CM Guidance and Control System, which only monitors for now. The Pitch Program rolled and pitched the launch vehicle from its 90° east of north launch azimuth (fixed by the launch pad design) to the correct azimuth and elevation for its ascent to orbit (72.034° east of north for Apollo 16). The CM's guidance system was used by the crew to provide an independent monitoring function, using the Command Module Computer's (CMC's) Program 11 (P11). The maximum pitch and yaw limits were 4° per second, and roll 11° per second. These were not bad given the size and mass of a fully loaded Saturn V! In extremis, the CM guidance system could be used to command the Saturn V, and there were numerous arguments among the astronauts on the feasibility of manually flying the Saturn V into orbit.
000:00:21|The CMC (Command Module Computer)is closely involved in computation of the spacecraft's trajectory throughout the flight though, during launch, the IU handles trajectory computation and vehicle control. The CMC is accessed by the crew via two DSKYs (Display and Keyboard), one of which is on the main instrument panel, the other being on the LEB (Lower Equipment Bay). The LM carries a computer of very similar design. The CMC contains a series of numbered Programs, which the crew control by entering numbers referred to as Verbs and Nouns. See the essay <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/../compessay.html" target="afj">The Apollo On-board Computers</a> by Phill Parker.
000:00:21|Dave Scott, Commander of Apollo 15, from 1998 correspondence - "The CMC computed the entire launch profile such that if the IU failed (at any time) the entire Saturn V, or subsequent stages, could be flown into orbit manually by using primarily the FDAI (Flight Director Attitude Indicator) and DSKY (Display-Keyboard) displays and one of the two RHCs (Rotational Hand Controllers). This is a little-known, but very important capability; and we spent a fair amount of time training for this. The DSKY display also provided a monitor of the IU performance, and if deviations were too large, the THC (Translation Hand Controller) could be used to disengage the IU completely and proceed with a manual launch insertion. Again, a very important 'abort-type' capability.
000:00:21|The FDAI is the critical "flying" instrument in the CM. Also referred to as the '8-Ball' from its colouring, the FDAI is similar to the ball-style artificial horizon found on many aircraft and, likewise, allows determination of the spacecraft's attitude with respect to a desired frame of reference. Usually this will be the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) though it may be the GDC (Gyro Display Coupler), a device which displays the spacecraft's attitude compared to a crew preselected attitude. The FDAI will also show attitude errors and the rates of change of attitude.
000:00:22|Tom Mattingly from 1972 technical debriefing - "I didn't sense lift-off, except for the lights. I didn't sense the (roll) program. To me it was just like the fixed-base simulator with the vibration on top of it.
000:00:22|A fixed-base simulator is one which does not move to simulate flight. The Apollo simulators are almost all of the fixed-base type, apart from those used to simulate docking maneuvers. While restricted in fidelity, they are fine for training the crew on operation of the spacecraft systems.
000:00:24|Charlie Duke from 1972 technical debriefing - "It is like an elevator slowly lifting off. But, at ignition I had the lateral frequency of something or other. It just kept shaking at the same frequency throughout the whole S-IC burn. You felt yourself going faster and faster. I had the feeling it was a runaway freight train on a crooked track, swaying from side to side. That was all the way through the first stage."]</p> [Charlie Duke is not the first crewman to make this comparison. Bill Anders made a very similar remark about his ride aboard <i>Apollo 8's</i> launch vehicle.
000:00:24|The four outer F-1 engines are gimballing to control the rocket's attitude, causing rotation around its centre of gravity. Since most of the vehicle's mass, the fuel and LOX of the first stage, is currently concentrated towards its base, the crew find themselves at the long end of a long see-saw and feel the side-to-side motions strongly.
000:00:48|The aerodynamic forces acting on the launch vehicle have been rising as the vehicle gains speed. However, the air around it is thinning rapidly with its increasing altitude. The interaction of these two changing values will result in a maximum degree of pressure on the vehicle's skin at 1 minute, 26 seconds into the flight; at a speed of about Mach 1.7 and an altitude of 14.3 km. This moment of maximum dynamic pressure is also often described as "Max q" since "q" is the engineering term for dynamic pressure (which is a product of speed and atmospheric density).
000:00:57|See comments on spacecraft atmosphere earlier. If there had been no reduction in cabin pressure by 25,000 ft altitude, Charlie Duke would have activated the right hand Cabin Pressure Relief valve to manually dump air pressure and avoid over-pressurizing the spacecraft. This was one of the major reasons for the crew wearing full space suits during launch. The valve would have been closed manually once cabin pressure fell to 8 psi.
000:01:04|Throughout the powered ascent of the launch vehicle, there are various modes of aborting the mission, each of which are appropriate to the current height and speed. For the first two of these modes, IA and IB, the Flight Plan defines the safe range of vehicle motion rates as not exceeding ±4° per second in pitch and yaw, ±20° per second in roll. Motion rates exceeding these limits will entail an abort.
000:01:04|The initial 42 seconds, to an altitude of about 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) are flown in abort Mode IA (One Alpha). If a dangerous situation occurs within this period, the CM would separate from the SM, and the LET (Launch Escape Tower, or just 'tower'), which is the solid-fuelled rocket mounted on top of the CM, would carry it up from the wayward launch vehicle while a small 'pitch control' motor at the top of the LET steers the assembly east out over the ocean and away from a possibly exploding booster below. The tower would be jettisoned only 14 seconds after the initiation of the abort. While this is going on, the highly dangerous hypergolic propellants of the Command Module's RCS would quickly and automatically be dumped overboard as they would be harmful to the recovery forces. The CM would then descend on parachutes to a normal splashdown. The Mode IA Abort Procedures are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4" target="afj">Page 4-1</a> of the Launch Checklist
000:01:04|Abort Mode IB extends from 42 seconds into the flight to an altitude of 30.5 km (16.5 nautical miles) as defined by the abort checklist. With the vehicle being further downrange and tilted over, the pitch control motor would not be required in the event of a IB abort. However, it had been discovered during hypersonic testing, that the CM/LET stack could be aerodynamically stable in a tower-first as well as a base-first attitude so a pair of canards were added which would be deployed automatically to force the combination into an attitude where the base of the CM is facing the direction of travel, ready for the safe deployment of the drogue and main parachutes. While the canards have little effect in a low altitude abort, they become increasingly important as the Saturn V gains speed through the IB mode. The Mode IB Abort Procedures are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4" target="afj">Page 4-1</a> of the Launch Checklist.
000:01:06|Feet wet" is the US Naval aviator radio call for flight over the coast from land to sea. Young and Mattingly are both US Navy officers, Duke is USAF as is Gordon Fullerton.
000:01:17|There is no obvious reason for the Master Alarm. However, it is clear that the crew is not fazed by it.
000:02:00|Mode IC is used for aborts occurring between 30.5 km (16.5 nautical miles) and the jettison of the tower. As the air is now very thin, the airflow around the pair of canards at the top of the tower would have little aerodynamic effect during an abort. Instead, the tower and BPC would be jettisoned and the Command Module's RCS used to control the orientation of the spacecraft. The safe range of vehicle motion rates are now defined as not exceeding &plusmn;9&deg; per second in pitch and yaw, &plusmn;20&deg; per second in roll. The Mode IC Abort Procedures are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4" target="afj">Page 4-2</a> of the Launch Checklist.
000:02:00|The crew now move to <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-8" target="afj">Page 2-8</a> of the Launch Checklist, and are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#Boost" target="afj">Page 4-59</a> of the Operational Procedures.
000:02:08|As the S-IC nears the end of its burn, Ken Mattingly is inhibiting the EDS with a switch directly below the computer keypad. The EDS is only needed for flight through the thickest part of the atmosphere where high aerodynamic forces and the structural load they impart to the vehicle could cause loss of control to turn catastrophic too quickly for the crew to react in time. With EDS switched off, any required aborts must be initiated by the crew, giving them more control.
000:02:22|Towards the end of the S-IC's boost phase, two factors serve to gradually increase the acceleration experienced onboard. First, the atmosphere is becoming essentially a vacuum, reducing the backpressure the exhaust gases have to fight against compared to the air pressure at sea level. This improves the efficiency of the engines so that from launch to cut-off, S-IC thrust rises 19% from 34,250 kN to about 40,700 kN. Second, the S-IC tanks are emptying, lightening the launch vehicle and presenting less inertia to the thrust. To alleviate these rising acceleration forces and the shock of all five engines shutting down simultaneously, the centre engine of the cluster is shut down 23.5 seconds earlier than the outboard engines. The outboard engines cutoff at 2:39.6, staging occurs at 2:40.7 and the second stage ignition command is at 2:41.8. The main reduction in thrust from full power on 4 engines to virtually zero will take less than 0.8 seconds.
000:02:22|Another effect of the reduced air pressure on the S-IC is visible on movie coverage of the launch as the base of the vehicle appears to be progressively consumed by the conflagration. Near the ground, the plume is constrained by air pressure into a narrow flame extending rearwards. With decreasing air pressure, the hot gases are able to expand into an ever widening plume. Towards the end of the S-IC's flight, the air is so thin and the slipstream so negligible that a small amount of exhaust is able to expand forwards up the side of the rocket's structure giving the appearance, on TV coverage, of the rocket's base being consumed by the plume.
000:02:48|Duke from the 1972 technical debrief - "I was surprised with [sic] the debris that I caught out of my left eye as it came by the hatch window from the staging.
000:02:49|<a name="j2desc"></a>The S-II stage carries five J-2 uprated engines which burn LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX to produce up to 1,041 kN (234,000 pounds) thrust each. They are capable of being restarted in flight but this feature is only implemented in the engine used in the S-IVB.
000:02:49|The thrust chamber and bell of each engine is fabricated from stainless steel tubes brazed together in a single unit. Supercold LH<sub>2</sub> is pumped through these tubes to cool the thrust chamber and simultaneously prewarm the fuel. The engine carries two separate turbopumps, both powered in turn by the exhaust from a gas generator which burns the stage's main propellants. The hot exhaust gas is fed from the gas generator, first to the fuel turbopump, then to the LOX turbopump before being routed to a heat exchanger and finally into the engine bell. The fuel and LOX outputs of both turbopumps are fed, via main control valves, to the thrust chamber injector via the LOX dome. Unlike the solid steel injector of the F-1, the J-2 injector is fabricated from layers of stainless steel mesh sintered into a single porous unit. A solid LOX injector behind this carries 614 posts which pass LOX through the injector and into the combustion chamber. Each post has a concentric fuel orifice around it and these orifices are attached to the porous injector. The fuel delivery is arranged to ensure that about 5 percent seeps through the injector face to cool it, the rest passing through the annular orifices.
000:02:49|The ASI (Augmented Spark Igniter), fed with propellant and mounted to the injector face, provides a flame to initiate full combustion. Valves are provided to bleed propellant through the supply system well before ignition to chill all components to their operating temperatures otherwise gas would be formed which would interfere with the engine's use of propellant as a lubricant in the turbopump bearings. A tank of gaseous helium is fabricated within a larger tank of gaseous hydrogen. This is the Start Tank. The helium provides control pressure for the engine's valves while the hydrogen spins up the turbopumps before the gas generator is ignited. A PU (Propellant Utilization) valve on the output of the LOX turbopump can open to reduce the LOX flowrate. This adjusts engine thrust down to 890 kN (200,000 pounds) during flight to optimise engine performance.
000:02:49|<a name="j2start"></a>To start the J-2 engine, spark plugs in the ASI and gas generator are energised. The Helium Control and Ignition Phase valves are actuated. Helium pressure closes the Propellant Bleed valves, it purges the LOX dome and other parts of the engine. The Main Fuel valve and the ASI Oxidiser valves are opened. Flame from the ASI enters the thrust chamber while fuel begins to circulate through its walls under pressure from the fuel tank. After a delay to allow the thrust chamber walls to become conditioned to the chill of the fuel, the Start Tank is discharged through the turbines to spin them up. This delay depends on the role of the engine. A one second delay is used for the S-II engines. Half a second later, the Mainstage Control Solenoid begins the major sequence of the engine start. It opens the control valve of the gas generator where combustion begins and the exhaust supplies power for the turbopumps. The Main Oxidiser valve is opened 14° allowing LOX to begin burning with the fuel which has been circulating through the chamber walls. A valve which has been allowing the gas generator exhaust to bypass the LOX turbopump is closed allowing its turbine to build up to full speed. Finally, the pressure holding the Main Fuel valve at 14° is allowed to bleed away and the valve gradually opens, building the engine up to its rated thrust.
000:02:51|The Apollo 16 mission is the eleventh flight of the Saturn V and the ninth manned launch of the booster. While the Apollo 16 launch vehicle configuration is essentially the same as that for Apollo 15, there have been continual small changes in configuration both to save weight and to fix problems. In many respects the Saturn V and Apollo spacecraft will remain experimental vehicles throughout their careers. The main change on AS-511 is the restoration of 4 retro-rockets to the S-IC stage to reduce the risk of collision between the first and second stages during separation. Until AS-510, 8 retrorockets were fitted in the outboard engine fairings and provided a total of 86,600 lbs force for 2/3 sec to help increase separation before ignition of the S-II's engines. The retrorockets are modified solid state Recruit rockets developed for the X-17 rocket used to test missile warheads in the 1950s and subsequently used for sounding rocket applications. Four were deleted from AS-510 as part of the weight savings to permit the carriage of the extra weight of the J-Mission spacecraft. In the event, separation distances during staging on Apollo 15 proved marginal and concern that failure of one retrorocket of the 4 could lead to the stages colliding has led to the return to 8 retrorockets on Apollo 16.
000:03:02|Mattingly is commenting that he had not seen the 5 lights come on to indicate the S-II engines have ignited. This should have happened at 02 44.
000:03:02|The lights go out again once each engine has reached 65 percent of rated thrust.
000:03:15|Once all five engines are firing, the explosive cord to cut the interstage ("skirt") between the S-I and the S-II is also armed. There will be a delay of 24 seconds after second stage engine start before the interstage is jettisoned. This ensures that the attitude of the vehicle has stabilized before the almost 10-metre-wide by 9-metre-long interstage falls away past the J-2 engines.
000:03:27|The LES consists of the tower, with all its rocket motors, instrumentation and canards; and the BPC (Boost Protective Cover), which is a shroud over the entire Command Module which protects the spacecraft from the friction generated heat of ascent, and from the exhaust of the Launch Escape Motor should the tower be used for an abort. The BPC includes two windows to allow visibility through the left hand and central windows of the CM. The central window is mounted in the main hatch of the CM. Only when the LES is jettisoned are the other three windows uncovered.
000:03:27|The main rocket motor of the LES, if used, would burn for eight seconds, generating 654 kN (147,000 pounds) through four nozzles which are angled to direct the exhaust away from the CM.
000:03:27|Abort Mode II lasts from the jettisoning of the tower to the decision to stage from the S-II to the S-IVB. In a Mode II abort, the Command and the Service Modules will separate from the launch vehicle and the SM main engine or its RCS engines will be used to get the spacecraft away from the launch vehicle. Then the CM and SM will separate before the CM completes a normal splashdown on the ocean. The Mode II Abort Procedures are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4" target="afj">Page 4-3</a> of the LaunchChecklist.
000:02:45|The CM has an Environmental Control System (ECS) cooling system using 2 glycol coolant loops. These are similar to those in a car engine; a glycol (antifreeze)/water mixture is pumped round a loop, collecting heat from the CM equipment and the crew spacesuits. It is then normally passed through radiators on the side of the SM, to cool it down by thermal radiation into space, before being pumped back into the CM. Until shortly before launch, the glycol is passed through refrigerators in the Launch Utility Tower to cool the spacecraft systems. Then, because the radiators are heated by friction with the atmosphere during ascent through the atmosphere, they are bypassed and the heat produced by the CM equipment and the crew is absorbed by the glycol and the pre-chilled structure. Once the spacecraft has reached an altitude of about 110,000 feet (30 kilometres), a secondary cooling system cuts in using the near vacuum to evaporate water, chilling the Evaporator. Glycol is then passed through the evaporator to cool it. Since the evaporator uses up water, the radiators are used in preference once the spacecraft is in orbit. At 000:02:45 Duke is supposed to have set 2 switches (Glycol Evaporator Steam Auto and Glycol Evaporator H<sub>2</sub>O Flow) to Auto in order to bring the evaporator on line. Mattingly is reminding him of this. Despite this, see 000:05:02
000:03:37|Throughout launch, P11 causes the the FDAI to display the difference between the launch vehicle attitude (controlled by the IU) and the nominal attitude calculated by the CMC. So long as the CMC and the IU are in agreement, the crew can be confident that the trajectory is good.
000:03:43|The jettisoning of the LES, with its load of unburnt solid propellant, significantly reduces the weight of the spacecraft.
000:04:25|During the 1972 technical debrief after the mission, Mattingly commented "I looked out of John (Young)'s window and particles were going past us in the same direction. I kept looking at that; there's no way. But, it did it. I don't remember it on the S-I; but I remember it on the S-II and the S-IV.
000:05:52|The crew are preparing the Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine ready for use in case it is needed during an abort. The SPS would only be needed in the event of a Mode III or Mode IV abort after 000:05:52. In a Mode III abort, the SPS would be used to correct the spacecraft trajectory to achieve the desired landing site in the Atlantic. In a Mode IV abort, the SPS would be used to take the spacecraft to orbit. In each case the SM Reaction Control System (RCS) would first be used to separate the CSM from a wayward S-IVB. There is no possibility to use a fire-in-the-hole maneuver given the proximity of the SPS to the fully loaded LM propellant tanks.
000:05:52|When the SPS is firing, the pitch and yaw attitude of the spacecraft must be controlled by positioning the gimbals that control the direction that the massive SPS engine is pointed in relative to the Service Module - the thrust vector. This can either be done automatically by the CMC, or manually by the CMP using the Rotational Controller. This latter is termed Manual Thrust Vector Control (MTVC), and this mode would be used in an abort since it provides more direct control to the pilot. However, the thrust vector must point through the spacecraft's centre of gravity or the spacecraft will start to tumble during any SPS burn. Under Rate command, any tendency to tumble is automatically corrected using signals from the spacecraft gyros. Under the alternative, termed Acceleration Command, the pilot must make the necessary corrections himself. Hence, Rate Command would make it easier to fly the spacecraft in what would be a very challenging situation. More information will be provided on the SPS later in the Flight Journal.
000:04:54|Linked to the selection of Rate Command, the crew select the Launch Vehicle/SPS Chamber Pressure Switch to command the associated gauge from showing the angle of attack (Alpha) obtained from the Q-Ball on the now-jettisoned LES to the SPS thrust chamber pressure (P<sub>c</sub>) – another example of a dual purpose indicator
000:04:56|The crew must now switch on the four SPS gimbal motors, two of which control the SPS engine orientation in pitch (Y axis) and two in yaw (Z axis). The SPS is able to vector (point) in slightly different directions to allow its thrust to be directed through the centre of mass of the spacecraft. Without this, firing the SPS would tend to make the spacecraft tumble, making accurate steering impossible. The range of movement is only 9° in each axis, but this is enough to cater for all planned configurations and fuel loads of the spacecraft.
000:03:30|Ken's humour refers to 000:03:30 when Charlie remembered to bring the evaporators on-line.
000:05:27|This method of relating GET (Ground Elapsed Time) is a common shorthand used throughout the mission. To some extent, the context determines whether the first figure is hours or minutes. These times are 0 hours, 8 minutes and 37 seconds; and 0 hours, 9 minutes and 19 seconds.
000:05:27|Each propellant tank in the S-II has five sensors near the bottom which signal when they are uncovered by the draining liquid. When it receives two such signals from the same tank, the IU computer begins a sequence which will lead to engine cut-off. However, this engine cut-off system is not armed until the measured level has fallen below a certain threshold so as to inhibit the possibility of a false shutdown. Fullerton is telling the crew when Mission Control expects the cut-off system to be armed, based on current consumption, and when the engines will subsequently be shut down.
000:05:52|COI stands for Contingency Orbit Insertion. This is another way of saying "abort Mode III". The S-IVB now has the capability to take the spacecraft to a point where the Service Module's large SPS engine can ignite and place the CSM into Earth orbit. However, in the event of such an abort, and without the S-IVB, the spacecraft would not be able to depart for the Moon, instead embarking on a planned for, but hopefully unrequired Earth orbit mission. The Mode III Abort Procedures are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4" target="afj">Page 4-4</a> of the Launch Checklist.
000:06:02|The gimbal motors are powered up to allow SPS control if needed in an abort. The crew select the 4 gimbal motors On, in the order Pitch 1, Yaw 1, Pitch 2, Yaw 2. They then select the Launch Vehicle/SPS Gimbal Position Indicator (GPI) switch on Panel 1 to GPI to allow them to monitor the position of the gimbals. Up until now, the GPIs have been monitoring the Saturn V's propellant tank pressures - another dual use gauge. The GPI scales are in degrees, about a zero midpoint.
000:06:02|The gimbal motors are selected On at intervals of at least one second to avoid any power surges.
000:06:29|The crew expected to see the increased current drain from fuel cells due to the gimbal motor selection. However, all the power appears to be coming from the batteries.
000:06:42|There are 4 omni-directional antennae, operating in the S-Band, mounted flush on the surface on the CM. These are used for communications while near the Earth. The crew select the best antenna dependent on the orientation of the spacecraft, in this case D which is to the right of the crew hatch (when looking forward).
000:06:43|Cut-off in CM tape from 000:06:43 to 000:10:23
000:07:42|As with the first stage, the centre or inboard engine of the S-II is cut-off early; in this case, to minimise the vehicle's pogo oscillation tendencies late into the burn. The inboard engine cut-off was at 7:41.77, 1 minute, 37.8 seconds before the outboard engines. This procedure derived from the S-II on <i>Apollo 13</i> on which the centre engine shut down unintentionally due to severe vibration activating the Thrust OK switch. Since the propellant will still be used by the other engines, the penalty is small.
000:08:16|At 008:14.8, the PU (Propellant Utilization) valves open, reducing the LOX flowrate and therefore the mixture ratio to the engines from 1:5.5 to 1:4.8. This results in a 14.7 percent reduction in thrust and a perceptible change in the g-forces felt by the crew. It is done to ensure equal depletion of the fuel and oxidiser.
000:08:41|Fullerton is informing the crew that the "level sense arm" signal has been sent to the IU. The engines will be shut down once two probes in one of the tanks have been uncovered by the dwindling propellant. They can expect shutdown shortly.
000:09:20|<a name="mode4"></a>Mode IV is the abort mode where the crew have been given a Go decision to continue to orbit using the S-IVB, and should that stage deviate from its allowed limits, the CSM will separate from the Saturn and use the SPS (Service Propulsion System) to continue into Earth orbit. The Mode IV Abort Procedures are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4" target="afj">Page 4-6</a> of the Launch Checklist.
000:09:20|The outboard engines cut-off at 9:19. One second after outboard cut-off, the S-IVB separates from the S-II. Ignition of the S-IVB's single J-2 engine occurs a tenth of a second later.
000:09:20|Although constructed as part of the S-IVB, the conical aft interstage is left with the S-II at separation. Unlike the earlier staging, this is a single plane separation as the vehicle is essentially outside the effects of the atmosphere. Also, as there is only one engine, there is no possibility of an unbalanced thrust across a cluster of engines skewing the S-IVB's attitude.
000:02:58|The sequence of events for the first ignition of the single J-2 engine in the third stage is essentially the same as for the engines in the S-II <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#j2desc" target="new" target="afj">(see 000:02:58).</a> The main change is that the supercold fuel is allowed to flow through the walls of the thrust chamber to condition it for three seconds, instead on one, before the Start Tank discharges through the turbines, spinning them up in preparation for operation.
000:09:34|Back to CM and TEC tapes
000:10:25|Ken Mattingly referring to the need to monitor the S-IVB for automatic shutdown. In other words, Young will manually shut the engine down when desired velocity is reached in case the IU computer fails to do so.
000:10:36|The crew are watching for an indicated velocity of 25,600 feet per second on the CMC. If the IU does not shut it down at this figure, Young will initiate shutdown at 25,700 fps.
000:11:07|Ken Mattingly is continuing to monitor the rate of change of altitude. As the guidance systems in the IU sense that they are reaching the required orbit, they command the S-IVB to pitch down slightly to avoid gaining excessive altitude and entering too elliptical an orbit. Hence, the stack is actually going "downhill" at a shallow angle, as it accelerates towards its final orbital velocity. The S-IV is also vibrating at about 65 cycles/second, which the crew feel as a "buzz" through the structure.
000:11:07|John Young is monitoring the speed of the spacecraft (in thousands of feet per second) on the DSKY. As described at 000:11:07, the spacecraft is slightly pitched down. Since the CM and crew are seated in a heads-down orientation relative to the Earth, this appears to them to be a pitch up maneuver.
000:11:47|The final orbital velocity is 25,605.1 feet per second (7,804.4 metres per second), with an orbital apogee of 91.3 nautical miles (169 kilometres) and perigee of 87.85 nautical miles (162.7 kilometres)
000:11:53|The crew now get on with the business of configuring the spacecraft for orbit. This is a busy period. They must read the orbital parameters from the CMC, following the bottom of <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-9" target="afj">Page 2-9</a> of the Launch Checklist, and the top of <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#Boost" target="afj">Page 4-63</a> of the Operational Procedures. Then they proceed with the Post-Orbital Insertion Checks starting on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-9" target="afj">Page 2-11</a> of the Launch Checklist, and are at the top of <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#Boost" target="afj">Page 4-65</a> of the Operational Procedures. These include making safe various systems that will not be required in orbit, including the Sequential Events Control Subsystem that controls, among other things, the various pyrotechnic devices on the spacecraft.
000:11:54|Next, the SPS gimbal motors are selected off, since there should be no need for SPS operation in orbit
000:12:03|Break in CM tape
000:12:40|On entering orbit, the crew selected Verb 06 Noun 62 on the CMC to confirm the orbital velocity, rate of altitude change and altitude. These values have then been down-linked to mission Control so that they can be compared to the orbital parameters measured by radar tracking stations.
000:14:51|The COAS is the Crewman Optical Alignment Sight, which resembles an aircraft gunsight. It has 2 functions. First, it provides a range and range-rate display during docking, using a reticule focused at the same distance as the target.  Secondly, it can be used to aim the 16mm data acquisition camera when this is mounted in the right-hand window. The COAS is stowed in a mount by the left-hand window during launch and entry, but can be used with either left or right rendezvous (forward facing) windows.
000:15:35|The crew are now onto <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-12" target="afj">Page 2-12</a> of the Launch Checklist. However, the sequence with which actions are carried out from this point are not necessarily in the order given in the Checklist.
000:15:37|Especially during the early flights of Apollo, the clarity of the Command Module windows was a major problem. There were 2 main causes: contamination due to the rocket that removed the Boost Protective Cover, and out-gassing of solvents in the sealant used on the windows. By the time of Apollo 16, many fixes had been introduced and the only major problem is some condensation between the inner and outer panes, and a 2 inch smear of contaminant on the outside of one of the side windows. For John Young's window to be clean is therefore a significant, if minor, victory.
000:15:42|Charlie Duke is testing the Master Alarm, as both he and Ken Mattingly are having problems hearing it. The Master Alarm is a combination of visual alert (2 lights on the Main Display Console, one in the Lower Equipment Bay) and an audio signal in the crew's headsets. Pressing any of the lights cancels the audio and visual alerts.
000:15:50|The crew are back at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-11" target="afj">Page 2-11</a> of the Launch Checklist.
000:15:51|The CM hatch has 2 modes of operation. Before launch, any need to operate the hatch must overcome both its own weight and that of the Boost Protective Cover hatch. To help, a lever mechanism including a pressurized nitrogen cylinder provides assistance to open the hatch(s). After reaching orbit, the gas must be vented to prevent over rapid opening of the weightless hatch. A spare gas cylinder provides the means to re-pressurise the nitrogen cylinder for Earth landing.
000:17:09|Break in CM tape
000:19:15|As Charlie Duke states, the crew are now on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-13" target="afj">Page 2-13</a> of the Launch Checklist and <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/aoh_op_procs.html#Insertion" target="afj">Page 4-68</a> of the Operational Procedures.
000:19:15|The ECS Post Insertion Configuration is the second stage in setting the Environmental Control System to its flight configuration. During launch, the valves are set to allow fluid to circulate through the reservoir. After orbital insertion, the reservoir is isolated to provide a reserve source of coolant in case of leakage.
000:19:25|From the Mission Report - "Shortly after orbital insertion, as the water/glycol reservoir was being isolated, the system valves were inadvertently positioned to completely block the primary coolant loop. The system was supplying no additional heat load in this configuration; therefore, the evaporator started to freeze and the indicated back pressure reached the lower limit of 0.05 psia. The reservoir valves were repositioned, flow was restored and the evaporator recovered smoothly with no adverse effects.
000:20:03|Gordon Fullerton finally made it to orbit in March 1982, as the pilot on STS-3, the third Space Shuttle mission.
000:21:23|CM Tape on again
000:52:07|Next communication with the ground will be at 000:52:07 through Carnarvon, Australia
001:28:40|The crew are just coming into darkness over Africa on their first orbit. They are in contact with Mission Control in Houston through the tracking station in the Canary Islands. The parking orbit around Earth does not permit continuous communication with Mission Control. Indeed, the orbit is so low that when the spacecraft does come within range of a station, it is only above the horizon for a few minutes, even if it passes directly overhead. If it passes to one side or the other, the period of contact is further constrained; for this pass over the Canary Islands tracking station, communication lasts only four minutes. (A15FJ amended)
001:28:40|At this stage, John Young, Charlie Duke and Ken Mattingly are working their way through the (Orbit) Insertion and Systems Checks on the CSM Launch Checklist. They are on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-12.gif" target="afj">Page L2-12</a>. The Capsule Communicator (CapCom) in Mission Control is Gordon Fullerton.
000:23:05|The crew has been wearing their spacesuits, including their helmets and gloves, since several hours before launch. Now that they are in orbit, the mission rules permit them to remove the helmets and gloves. They will not remove the rest of the suits until after the separation of the Lunar Module from the S-IVB during Translunar Coast.
000:23:14|The crew has a small tool set to help with a number of task on the spacecraft, stowed in a fabric pouch. These include an emergency wrench, an adjustable wrench (spanner), a ratchet wrench, and a selection of sockets, screw driver and torque bits to fit various fasteners. Most are modified off-the-shelf tools. Tool E is a adapter handle that, as well as fitting most of the specialist bits, can also be used by itself. As it is the most commonly used of the tools in the spacecraft, two are carried.</p> <img src="pics/cm_tools2.gif" title="" alt="Picture of CM Toolkit" style="width: 580px; height: 447px;">
000:23:22|Numerous items of personal and spacecraft equipment are stowed in compartments, lockers and bags throughout the Command Module (CM). Stowage compartments are part of the cabin structure and most of the equipment stowed in them is in cushioned bags. The lockers are pre-packed before the mission and are attached to the aft bulkhead and equipment bays a short time before launch. This allows groundcrew to gain access to the aft bulkhead during the pre-flight preparation of the spacecraft. Both compartment and locker doors have squeeze-type latches that can be operated with one hand. The compartments and lockers are labelled on the doors for identification and to aid location. They are numbered consecutively from fore to aft and are prefixed with a letter to indicate which equipment bay they are in.Lower equipment bay compartments are B1 to B8, the right hand equipment bay ones are R1 to R13 and the left hand equipment bay ones L2 and L3. The aft bulkhead has lockers A1 to A8 while the upperequipment bay as lockers and bags U1 to U4. There are two expandable temporary stowage containers under the left and right-hand forward equipment bays, designated F1 and F2.
000:23:22|The various stowage locations have to prevent the items they contain from coming adrift in zero g, and <img style="width: 278px; height: 431px;" alt="Image of stowage U1" title="" src="pics/cm_stowage_u1.gif" align="right">during in-flight manoeuvres. They must also retain the items during the forces imposed during launch and landing. The contents of each bay are supposed to be detailed in planning documents. However, there are almost always changes just before each flight and the crew may not always remember what is where. Stowage location U1 is immediately behind and below Charlie Duke's head on the right hand side of the cabin.
000:30:20|There is some confusion over the correct location. Serial 8 of the checklist on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-12.gif" target="afj">Page L2-12</a> states that helmet bags are in U-1. The three helmet stowage bags are actually in U-2, next to John Young's head and in accordance with the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/02stowage.html" target="afj">Stowage List</a>. See also Charlie Duke's comments at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#000_30_20" target="afj">000:30:20</a>)
000:23:34|The Temporary Stowage Bags are used for temporary stowage of small items, and for the disposal of dry refuse. There are three bags, one for each of the crew. The bags are stowed in U-1 for launch and entry. In flight, the Commander's bag attaches to the left shelf, the <a target="_new" href="acron.html#lmp">LMP</a>'s to the right shelf and the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/acron.html#cmp" target="afj">CMP</a>'s to the lower equipment bay. (AOH 2.12.5.4.1). The helmet stowage bags prevent scratches and damage to the crews' plastic "bubble" helmets while not being worn.
000:24:12|For launch and entry, the tool set pouch is stowed in a stowage locker on the aft bulkhead beneath the centre seat location. In flight, it can be attached to the CM structure by velcro pads.
000:24:25|The CM seats are intricate mechanisms in their own right, with nine separate major adjustments that can be made, and a host of smaller ones. The three seats also differ in detail. The seat functions are summarised <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/02system_couches.html" target="afj">in this link</a>. Now at Serial 8 on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-12.gif" target="afj">Page L2-12</a> of the Launch Checklist, Charlie Duke is intending to lower the seatpan from its 85 launch degree to 170 degrees (effectively flat with the main seat back), to help him move to the Lower Equipment Bay to check the Main Regulator.
000:24:35|This was John Young's fourth spaceflight, after Gemini III and X, and Apollo 10 but even so a pulse rate of only 108 during launch is fairly exceptional.
000:29:39|<a name="p52"></a>Throughout the mission, one of Ken Mattingly's jobs is to ensure that the inertial guidance platform is kept aligned. He is actually a bit early, since there are quite a few more checklist items before he gets to the stage where he can carry out the first of many such alignments during the flight. He will get to this later, at around 000 29 39.
000:25:02|Ken Mattingly has moved onto Serial 9 of the Launch Checklist <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-12.gif" target="afj">Page 2-12</a>. This serial consists of a number of checks of the Environmental Control System before the crew can remove their gloves and helmets.
000:25:15|The Apollo spacecraft uses a relatively simple system to maintain the cabin oxygen supply to the crew. Oxygen is stored in liquid form in three tanks in the Service Module. The Environmental Control System (ECS) draws off oxygen gas, heats it, and feeds it to the Command Module cabin through a pressure regulating system. As the crew converts oxygen to carbon-dioxide, the latter is absorbed by lithium dioxide scrubbers. This, and the inevitable leakage, reduces the pressure in the cabin, which is then topped up from the oxygen supply. Normal flow rate is about 0.43 lb/hour but this will depend on many factors, not least crew activity
000:25:49|An interesting transcription - possibly representing the sound of the valve opening?
000:26:23|Delta-P would be a change in pressure, which might have occurred due to the suit valve opening. However, it is possible that there has been a transcription error and that Ken Mattingly really said "Delta-V" - to indicate that he had felt an acceleration. This would also fit with Charlie Duke's comment immediately before, which looks like "<a target="_new" href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a>. See the comment at 000:26:23.
000:26:16|With John, Ken and Charlie moving around the cabin, there is a risk of nudging the hand controllers and associated <a target="_new" href="acron.html#rcs">RCS</a> controls. Hence, the CM RCS Logic switch was selected Off earlier as one of the items in Serial 1 of the Insertion and Systems Checks.
000:26:23|Ken Mattingly is suggesting that there is some acceleration (change in velocity is termed Delta-V), This is probably due to the S-IVB <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/acron.html#aps" target="afj">APS</a> operating to maintain the attitude of the spacecraft and stage.
000:26:23|It is not clear if John Young is referring to the thunderstorms the crew saw over Africa a few minutes below, or to flashes from <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/acron.html#aps" target="afj">APS</a> motors firing.
000:26:48|The crew still have their spacesuits helmets and gloves on, and are getting their oxygen flow directly from the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/acron.html#ecs" target="afj">ECS</a>. Before Ken Mattingly turns off the flow to the suits, the crew must take off their helmets.
000:40:25|See <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#000_40_25" target="afj">000 40 25</a> for a description of the main regulators check.
000:27:43|See <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/02photoequip.html" target="afj">this link</a> for details of the cameras carried by Apollo 16.
000:27:50|As Ken has unlocked his helmet at the securing neck ring, the residual pressure differential ("Delta-P") has pushed the helmet off his head. Under normal conditions, the ECS will keep the suit at 35kPa (5.1 psi), compared to a cabin pressure of 34.5 kPa (5 psi). The oxygen flow rate through the suit is approximately 0.2 to 0.3 cubic metres (7 to 11 cubic feet) per minute, and is used to cool the wearer, as well as removing CO<sub>2</sub>, odours and water. While on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/acron.html#eva" target="afj">EVA</a>, additional cooling is provided by passing water through a Liquid Cooling Garment that can be worn under the space suit, but this is not needed for normal use.
000:28:30|Probably referring to the oxygen flow
000:28:51|John Young is probably referring to the may be referring to the two SPS Delta V thrust switches on Panel 1, which were the subject of a short-circuit on Apollo 15. While trying to move around in the cramped confined of the CM cabin, wearing his spacesuit, there is a considerable risk that he will hit something. Even though the switches are guarded to protect against inadvertent operation, there is still some risk of knocking into them. Alternatively, John Young may be referring to either the Rotation Controller mounted on his right-hand armrest, or to the Translation Controller mounted on Ken Mattingly's left-hand armrest. Charlie Duke's seat has no armrests and, as CMP, he has no need for the CM flight controls.
000:29:04|Charlie Duke is joking - in weightless conditions, there is no tendency to float in any particular direction - and there is no helium in his suit to make him act like a balloon! It is more likely that the basic tendency of the suit to adopt a straight position is helping force him from his seat.
000:29:39|P52 is another of the Command Module Computer (CMC) programmes. This one is used to align the Inertial Measurement Unit in the Guidance and Nav System. Throughout the mission, one of Ken Mattingly's jobs is to ensure that the inertial guidance platform is kept aligned. He has just completed the first of numerous such realignments, a task usually known by the name of the program used, Program Number 52, or simply "P52".
000:29:39|Guidance and navigation are crucial to any journey and even more so in the ballistic dance of getting to the Moon and back. The crew must be able point the spacecraft in precise, well known directions, so that their engines will send them where they want to go. The spacecraft carries a gyroscopically stabilised platform within the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) which remains fixed in attitude while the spacecraft rotates around it, connected to it by three orthogonal gimbals. The only way to ensure that the platform is properly aligned is to compare it to a fixed attitude reference - the stars are almost always used. Initially, the CSM (Command/Service Module)'s platform was aligned before launch. Realignment is achieved by using P52 on the CMC (Command Module Computer). With the spacecraft held in a steady attitude the sextant is pointed at a specified star, marked, then to a second star, where another mark is taken. The computer, knowing the attitude of the spacecraft (relative to its own idea of where the stars are), now has new values of where the stars are located. The amount of drift the platform has experienced since the previous realignment is calculated, and displayed as the amount of correction needed to move, or "torque" the gimbals to bring the platform back into accurate alignment. Known as "gyro torquing angles", they are displayed on the DSKY as "Noun 93". These angles are usually very small, and are expressed in thousandths of a degree.
000:29:39|Before the platform realignment can begin, the optics dust cover, on the opposite side of the CM from the hatch, must be jettisoned to enable the spacecraft's optical instruments to be used. The cover protects the external surfaces of the sextant and scanning telescope during spacecraft preparation and launch. Ken is supposed to observe the jettison through the unity power SCT (Scanning Telescope). (A15FJ amended)
000:30:18|While the crew are making themselves and the spacecraft ready, the Public Affairs Officer is giving a press briefing.
000:30:18|The crew have gone back to the check list. Charlie Duke is at Serial 9 on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-12.gif" target="afj">Page L2-12</a>. Meanwhile, at Serial 8, Ken Mattingly is supposed to move to the Lower Equipment Bay in preparation for carrying out Serial 10, the Main Regulator Check.
000:31:34|Ken Mattingly has skipped Serial 10, and has moved onto Serial 23 on Page <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-16.gif" target="afj">L2-16</a>, to jettison the Optics Dust Covers in preparation to align the inertial platform. First, he selects power On, using switch S4 on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/pics/cm_panel100.gif" target="afj">Panel 100</a>, then he moves to <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/pics/cm_panel120.gif" target="afj">Panel 122</a> and continues with the checklist.
000:31:34|There are two separate optical instruments in the Guidance and Navigation System, and these are used by the crew to take navigational sightings of the stars or landmarks on the Earth and Moon. Together with their associated machinery, they are large heavy systems. They also represent an important design philosophy dating back to the earliest days of Apollo. By providing the crew with the means to navigate independently of ground control, they provide an important safety measure in case communication is lost. As well as allowing for breakdown of the communications system, there is another more sinister consideration here. Apollo was designed at the height of the Cold War, and there was a real fear that its communications could be jammed by the USSR. In the event, spaceflight proved to be co-operative, and the competitive nature of the "Space Race" never spilled over into aggression.
000:31:34|The optics point out through the heatshield of the Command Module. During launch, they are covered first by the by the Boost Protective Cover, and after its jettison, by two separate covers which are jettisoned by the crew. Ken Mattingly is supposed to observe the jettisoning of the covers through the Scanning Telescope.
000:33:20|Ken is now proceeding with Serial 24 on Page <a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);" href="csmlc/a16L2-17.gif">L2-17</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">.
000:33:26|The optics covers were supposed to jettison when Ken moved the Optical Hand Controller to the right to drive the Sextant and Scanning Telescope shafts. He is not sure if the covers have indeed jettisoned, and is wondering whether to try again, driving the shafts the other way.
000:33:32|The IMU alignment with P52 is supposed to be carried out while the spacecraft is over the night side of the Earth. Waiting for the spacecraft to regain contact with Mission Control, when Apollo 16 is over Australia, will preclude this.
000:33:32|Contrary to popular belief, it is as hard to see the stars from a brightly lit spacecraft in orbit, as it is from inside a brightly lit house on Earth. To be able to see the stars through the telescope or the sextant, Ken Mattingly has to let his eyes adjust to the dark. The lighting controls at the Navigation Station are able to be dimmed independently of the rest of the cabin to aid this.
000:33:38|John Young has experience of Ken Mattingly’s tasks, having taken Apollo 10 to the Moon as the CMP on that flight.
000:34:19|John Young is reading off the orbital parameters from the DSKY. To obtain these, he will have called up P[rogram] 11 then entered Verb 82. The spacecraft is in an orbit with Apogee 95 nautical miles (176km), Perigee 90 nautical miles (167km).
000:34:31|Ken Mattingly from 1972 Technical debrief: "Once again, I heard the sextant cover go off, but I did not hear the telescope cover go. Like everyone else that has looked through there, I looked and didn't see a thing in the telescope and I was concerned about what to do next. In fact, we talked about it. What was the best thing to do? I didn't think the cover had gone. While we were playing around, we came across a star pattern that was bright enough to see and it was an excellent telescope. There was no debris that you would see from it.
000:39:07|See <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#ordeal" target="afj">000:39:07</a> for a description of the Orbital Rate Display - Earth And Lunar.
000:35:27|Charlie Duke is providing a gentle reminder that they have skipped several checklist serials.
000:35:41|The star reference numbers were given by their octal (base 8) number. The first star used by Ken Mattingly is Denebola, (number 23) which is also called Beta Leonis (the second brightest star in the constellation Leo).
105:11:33|Note that four of these are not really stars but allow the crew member to enter other celestial objects into the computer. For a more full description of the origins of the names, see Apollo 15 Commander Dave Scott's commentary at <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a15/a15.postland.html#1051133" target="afj">105:11:33 in the Apollo 15 Lunar Surface Journal</a>.
000:37:07|Ken Mattingly is evidently making progress with the P52.
000:37:23|Menkent, Star No 30, is also known as Theta Centauri.
000:38:38|Ken is getting some good readings from his star sightings. See comments at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#000_38_38" target="afj">000 38 38</a> for more details.
000:38:38|Ken Mattingly plans to apply the correction torques at 38:40
000:38:38|After the star sightings, the computer calculated that the measured angle between the stars, as given by Noun 05, exactly matched the angle the computer knows is between them. This is a powerful check of the precision with which Ken Mattingly has made the measurements. The difference between the intended platform orientation and its actual state was 0.040° in x, 0.031° in y, and 0.045° in z. These values were displayed through the Noun 93 display on the DSKY and will be used to bring the platform back into correct alignment at 38 minutes, 40 seconds into the flight.
000:38:41|Ken is slightly pleased at the accuracy of his sighting.
000:38:52|It is not clear what Charlie Duke is referring to.
000:39:07|Conversely, if the spacecraft is to be flown in 'orb-rate,' keeping the same face towards the surface (to point cameras for example), it must rotate around one of its axes at a rate which matches the orbital period. Normally, the FDAI displays the spacecraft's attitude relative to the celestial sphere (i.e. it normally shows the inertial attitude) but the function of the ORDEAL is to provide the correct drive signal to rotate the FDAI at a rate which also matches the orbital period. With the ORDEAL, the FDAI will display attitudes relative to the surface below.
000:39:25|John Young is suggesting that the adaptation to weightlessness is due to the experience gained as an aircraft pilot. All three of the crew are ex-fighter pilots, and two thousand flying hours is a lot in that job. However, by 2003, John Young had logged more than 14,750 hours flying time in props, jets, helicopters, rocket jets, and spacecraft, including 835 hours in six space flights
000:39:25|The astronauts fly NASA's fleet of T-38 two-seat trainer aircraft. With very small wings, these aircraft are renowned for their ability to roll rapidly, a manoeuvre that is particularly likely to induce motion sickness due to inner ear movements.
000:39:30|John Young and Charlie Duke now go back to checklist Serial 11 on page <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-13.gif" target="afj">L2-13</a>, the Secondary Radiator Leak Check. This provides a rapid pressure integrity check of the secondary radiator circuit, to confirm that no leaks have occurred during launch. The primary radiator circuit has already been selected on during the boost phase, but the secondary circuit is only used when additional cooling is needed. The radiators work by circulating a water-glycol mixture through the large panels at the bottom of the Service Module. With both systems operating, the radiators can remove excess heat at a rate of 4415 British Thermal Units per hour (approximately 1.3 kilowatts).
000:39:56|Ken Mattingly is ribbing John Young and Charlie Duke that they are doing the tasks the CMP is supposed to be doing
000:40:04|John Young may be making a reference to his prank on Gemini 3 (the first manned Gemini mission) when he offered his commander, Gus Grissom, a corned-beef sandwich that he had smuggled past the authorities. John Young was officially rebuked for the incident.
000:40:25|Having completed Serial 11, the crew now start on Serial 10 on Page <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-13.gif" target="afj">L2-13</a>, the Main Oxygen Regulator Check. This checks both halves of the main regulator which governs the flow of oxygen into the cabin and the spacesuits (when the latter have their hoses connected to the oxygen supply system). The controls are on Panel 351 in the Lower Equipment Bay. As with many Apollo systems there are two parallel control valves (A and B) for redundancy. Ken Mattingly selects each Off in turn, then operates the Emergency Cabin Pressure Regulator which would provide a rapid dump of oxygen into the cabin in case of a leak. During the flight, the crew will be in a shirt-sleeve environment; and the Emergency Cabin Pressure Regulator would give them time to don their spacesuits again if necessary.
000:41:39|The Main Regulator Check is now complete.
000:41:42|With the crew carrying out the checklist in a non-standard order, it has become unclear what has been checked. Ken is asking if the Secondary Radiator Leak Check has been done. John Young and Charlie Duke actually carried it out two minutes earlier. Meanwhile, Charlie Duke has moved to Serial 14 on Page <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-14.gif" target="afj">L2-14</a>, the Fuel Cell Purge Check.
000:41:44|As a normal part of the purge operation initiated by Charlie Duke, the Master Alarm went off.
000:42:17|Charlie Duke has now finished the Fuel Cell Purge Check.
000:42:23|Charlie Duke is now moving on to Serial 15 on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-14.gif" target="afj">Page 2-14</a>, the Electrical Power System Monitoring Check. This first involves checking the pressure in the cryogenic tanks in the SM that contain Liquid Hydrogen and Liquid Oxygen. It then checks the operation of the three Fuel Cells in which the hydrogen and oxygen react to form water and electricity. Finally, the electrical distribution busbar voltages are then checked. While Charlie is doing this, John Young and Ken Mattingly continue to unpack storage canisters and prepare the cabin.
000:42:27|The contents list for Stowage A-8 is given on Page A-147 of the Flight Plan.
000:43:10|As on previous lunar missions, a number of cameras are carried on Apollo 16; a detailed list can be found at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/02photoequip.html" target="afj"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this link</span></a>. The three main still cameras are made by Hasselblad and take 70-mm film. Two of these are stowed in the LM, and one in the CM.
000:43:27|The habitable cabin volume of the Apollo CM is only large in comparison to Mercury and Gemini. Mercury's cabin was 1.4 m<sup>3</sup> (50 ft<sup>3</sup>), while Gemini's was 2.3 m<sup>3</sup> (80 ft<sup>3</sup>). Apollo was a roomy 5.9 m<sup>3</sup> (210 ft <sup>3</sup>), but Skylab (based on a converted S-IVB stage) was to be in a whole new league at 319 m<sup>3</sup> (11,303 ft<sup>3</sup>.
000:44:13|The reference to Systems Test 5B indicates that Charlie Duke has reached the end of the Electrical Power System Monitoring Check.
000:44:58|John Young is probably referring to the S-IVB propellant pressures. Liquid Oxygen pressures were predicted to be in the range 36 to 41 psi, and Liquid Hydrogen in the range 19 to 21 psi.
000:45:17|Checklist Serial 19 requires the Sequence Camera Bracket to be unstowed, along with the ORDEAL. However, this has already been done, and John Young and Ken Mattingly proceed directly to Serial 22 on Page <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-16.gif" target="afj">L2-16</a>.
000:45:45|The Data Acquisition Camera is a 16 mm movie camera, used to obtain short film records of events. Because of its ability to record the sequence of events, it is sometimes referred to as the Sequence Camera (which was also the name of the equivalent camera during the Gemini missions).
000:49:12|The GDC Align is Serial 18 in the Checklist. However, it will be delayed until 000:49:12.

The first camera is the 16 mm DAC, which is fitted with the 18 mm lens, and mounted in the left-hand rendezvous window. The camera settings are T8 with a shutter speed of 1/250th of a second, focussed at 10 feet, at 12 frames per second and using Magazine AA.
000:46:21|Charlie Duke is carrying on with the Secondary Glycol Loop Check at Serial 21 on Page <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-16.gif" target="afj">L2-16</a> while John Young and Ken Mattingly carry on unstowing the cameras.

000:46:42|They now set up the Hasselblad EL and the Spotmeter (lightmeter), and stow it in Charlie Duke's Temporary Stowage Bag, ready for use. The Hasselblad is set at f/8 aperture, 1/250th of a second, and has Magazine NN loaded. NN contains colour film, with a capacity of 160 pictures (referred to as "frames"). It's first intended use will be to photograph the Lunar Module in the S-IVB after the Transposition Manoeuvre.
000:46:59|The checklist does not indicate what distance to set the Hasselblad focus to. John Young can either set it to ten foot, for general use in the cabin or to infinity for photography of the Earth.
000:47:31|Charlie Duke has finally unstowed the Temporary Stowage Bags.

001:00:29|John Young is irritated at Mission Control...
001:03:33|Break in CM Tape until 001:03:33
001:02:09|At its base, the S-IVB stage has two thruster units, one on either side. Known as the APS (Auxiliary Propulsion System), each one has two thrusters facing to either side of the unit which can rotate the stage in yaw or roll. Each also has one facing away from the stage which allows control of pitch, and one facing the same direction as the main J-2 engine. This last is used as a ullage motor to help push the propellants to the bottom of their tanks and give a head of pressure in the propellant lines. (A8FJ)
001:03:11|CM Tape on again
001:03:40|Verb 83 calls up a Rendezvous Parameter Display routine on the DSKY. In this case, John Young wants to read the angle to the local horizontal (theta) display so that he can set the FDAI to the current pitch attitude as he initialises the ORDEAL.
001:04:45|Ken Mattingly is suggesting that if the APS module fails, the S-IVB's J2 engine will be able to steer the spacecraft correctly. However, if the S-IVB cannot hold its orientation, then the crew could not carry out the docking manoeuvre to allow them to extract the LM from the booster.
001:06:17|John Young is thinking about how they might reduce the helium pressure in the APS. One option is deliberately to pitch the spacecraft away from the correct attitude using the Verb 46 procedure for direct control of the booster, then let it fire the APS to correct the resulting pitch error.
001:07:43|Dr. Spock's 1946 book <i>Baby and Child Care</i>, was the most influential child-rearing book of the 1950s and 1960s, and a massive best-seller. It claimed to cover most eventualities that parents would meet with in rearing a child. The Flight Data File is the main set of reference documents carried on the spacecraft. It contains the checklists, manuals, charts, and more. It weighs about 9 kg (20lb).
001:08:40|To allow the Hasselblad film to be changed, a light-proof slide has to be inserted between the film and the camera body. Leaving this slide in place while trying to take a picture is a very basic mistake that is made by most Hasselblad users at some time or other.
001:09:11|R12 is the Flight Data File container.
001:09:41|Charlie Duke has noticed that the docking light has been deployed. This is a light mounted on a door in the SM just behind the CM. When initially selected On, the door is opened by a spring and the spotlight comes on to provide a 10-degree wide light beam pointing along the spacecraft X-axis.
001:10:45|This is Serial 26 on the Launch Checklist on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-17.gif" target="afj">Page L2-17</a>.
001:11:55|Ken is going through the Flight Data File.
001:13:24|John Young and Charlie Duke are now looking at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-10.gif" target="afj">Page 2-10</a> of the Launch Checklist, which provides a procedure for controlling the S-IVB attitude using the Service Module Reaction Control System in the event of an APS module failure. This is precisely the failure that they are concerned may occur due to the excessive APS helium pressure. They now start rehearsing the procedure that they might have to follow.
001:14:32|The landing card will only be needed if the crew have to abort the mission and return to Earth...
001:14:44|The crew still need the Boost reference cards for Trans Lunar Injection.
001:14:55|Charlie Duke is continuing to go through the contingency procedures.
001:19:02|It is not clear what this is but there is a fair likelihood that Charlie Duke means his finger!
001:19:34|And back to discussing the S-IVB APS
001:23:12|The docking probe is the complex mechanism at the front of the CM, used to dock to the LM. Although the checklist Serial 27 is termed "Extend Docking Probe", the Serial actually requires an extension and retraction, to check the correct operation of the probe. Without a functional probe, there is no point the crew going ahead with TLI, as they would be unable to dock with the LM. There is no downlink-report of the docking probe, so there is no reason to delay its release until the spacecraft is over the USA in accordance with the Flight Plan's timeline. The crew now proceed to release the probe, following Checklist Serial 27 on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-18.gif" target="afj">Page L2-18</a>.
001:23:56|The probe has reached the fully extended configuration, with two gray talkback indicators. The next stage is to set it to back to Retract.
001:30:54|From the context, it seems that the crew have seen the contrail of a high-flying aircraft.
001:31:05|This is a good example of the difficulty in determining what the real conversation was at some times in the mission. The three transcripts all give different versions. That given is the Command Module transcript, but in the Technical transcript, it is quoted as "Duke: OK, Houston. How are you doing" while in the Public Affair Office transcript it is "CapCom: How are you doing". Although the Public Affairs Officer transcript is normally the least authoritative (since it was the least critical and hence least reviewed), it seems likely that Gordon Fullerton did reply to John Young's "Are you there?" with "How are you doing", but that this was not received by the crew.
001:48:38|Break in CM tape until 001 48 38
001:31:44|The PAO means that the pressure has not released as planned. However, he is suggesting that the valve is releasing some pressure, if not as much as it is intended to.
001:33:59|<a name="pad"></a>Throughout the mission, large lists of numbers, called PADs, will be read up to the crew which give them the information necessary to carry out a particular manoeuvre. PAD stands for Pre-Advisory Data. Some of these "block data" are for planned manoeuvres such as the TLI (Translunar Injection) or LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion) burns. Other PADs, such as the "TLI plus 90" and "Lift-off plus 8" mentioned here are the first of 27 abort options which will be read up to the crew at scheduled times throughout the early and middle portions of the mission. Note that the TLI+90 PAD has nothing to do with TLI itself but would occur 90 minutes after a successful TLI burn in the event of an abort. However, mission planners have decided that at no time beyond Earth orbit will the crew be without a get-you-home PAD. If at any time the crew subsequently lose communication with Earth, they will have the information to hand to get themselves back manually.
001:33:59|To simplify the voice transmission of these huge lists of numbers and reduce the likelihood of errors, each type of PAD was precisely formatted both in Mission Control's and the crew's paperwork - all the crew needed to do was fill in the blanks.
001:33:59|The abort PADs are the responsibility of RETRO, one of the flight controllers in the front row of the MOCR (Mission Operations Control Room). According to Chuck Deiterich, who was one of those who occupied the RETRO console throughout Apollo, "There is quite a bit of protocol in the PAD process. Empty PADs were in tablets of no carbon required (NCR) paper. We would make about six copies and use a red ballpoint on the top (original) so the CapCom would be sure what was part of the printed form and what was data." (2003 correspondence).
001:34:13|As CapCom Gordon Fullerton was reading up the PAD, the communication route was transferred to a ship in the Atlantic, USNS Vanguard. The changeover has caused Charlie to miss some of the information.
001:36:12|The communications link has transferred to the Vanguard...
001:36:15|Carrying on with the PAD.
001:36:18|To confirm the figures, Charlie Duke reads back the PAD.
001:38:14|The Lift-off + 8 PAD carries data for P37, a program in the computer that will calculate the details of a burn that will return the crew to Earth. An important condition for P37 is that the spacecraft must still be in Earth's sphere of influence, thus simplifying the calculations. The program takes the four values from the PAD; the specified time for ignition of the engine, a specified maximum change in velocity (or Delta-V), the longitude of the splashdown and the GET for the start of re-entry. These act as a set of constraints with which it calculates the desired trajectory and the details of the burn to achieve it.
001:38:30|And now the PAD for the TLI Burn itself.
001:38:40|The data read up by Fullerton is structurally different to other PADs as the manoeuvre is controlled by the IU on the launch vehicle, and not the computer in the CM. A form for filling in the numbers is available on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-21.gif" target="afj">L2-21</a>
001:38:40|<a name="tb6"></a>The timings for events relating to the launch vehicle are defined relative to a number of time bases, each of which start with a particular event. This allows controllers to move complete sequences of events relative to the overall mission time. The restart sequence for the S-IVB's single J-2 engine is tied to Time Base 6 (TB-6). When TB-6 begins, all subsequent events to restart the engine such as tank repressurisation, engine chilldown, ullage, etc., follow on, leading to the engine start command 9 minutes, 30 seconds later, and ignition 8 seconds after that.
002:23:57|The crew also have tasks to perform in the minutes leading up to the TLI burn and they use their event timer to help them. Around 002:23:57, the 'S-II Sep' lamp is illuminated for ten seconds, this being the start of TB-6. At 9 minutes to ignition, John will start the event timer counting up, having previously set it to 51:00. This will give a visual count-up to and beyond ignition to aid the crew in sequencing their final tasks before and during TLI. Items in the checklist are therefore shown with times from 51:00, through (1:)00:00 and upwards.
001:40:43|Ellington Air Force Base (now Ellington Field) is located approximately 24 km (15 miles) south of downtown Houston, near the major highway heading from the City to NASA and Galveston Island. It is where NASA bases its small fleet of aircraft in support of the Manned Spacecraft Centre.
001:41:45|At this point, the Command Module's computer, the CMC, must be set to receive the updated state vector. This involves setting the Up Telemetry (Tlm) switch to the right of the DSKY to Accept. The CMC must also be in an idle status (running P00, essentially a 'do-nothing' program). P00 is commonly pronounced 'pooh' by all the Apollo crews as in the character from A. A. Milne's book <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>. As recounted in Murray &amp; Cox's book, <em>Apollo: The Race to the Moon</em>, this program name even entered the daily lingo of the flight controllers. To 'go to poo' meant to go to sleep. While the CMC is receiving data link information by up-telemetry, the top left DSKY status light will illuminate.
001:42:08|Mission Control has some final updates to the procedures for TLI, starting on Page L2-28 of the Checklist.
001:42:28|And on Page <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-29.gif" target="afj">L2-29</a>.

001:49:50|Towards the end of the TLI burn, the S-IVB's thrust will actually produce an acceleration of nearly 1.4g, so all the items in the CM have to be properly secured.
001:50:00|If the attitude of the spacecraft changes, there could be a small amount of lateral acceleration. Placing heavy objects on the spacecraft's shelf under the side windows would not be a good location.
001:50:39|The technical transcript and the CM tape transcripts do not agree for the period 001 50:39 to 001:50:52. The technical transcript gives continued conversation between Charlie Duke and Gordon Fullerton, lasting up until 001:54:23, about 30 seconds before <a target="_new" href="acron.html#los">LOS</a>. The CM transcript details a conversation between all three crew members, but this does not fit in with the other conversation. It appears that the CM transcript timings may be in error. The following details both conversations in turn.
001:54:21|The suspect CM tape follows. The two tapes agree again from 001:54:21.
001:54:21|No more CM tape data recorded until 001:54:21

With a huge tracking antennae in the bulbous nose, the ARIA provides a mobile "ground" station where the Manned Spaceflight Network cannot provide communications. Four of these aircraft were converted at the time of Apollo.
001:54:33|The CM tape transcript ascribes this to Ken Mattingly.
001:54:54|The crew are now starting to prepare the spacecraft for Trans Lunar Injection, starting at the top of <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-27.gif" target="afj">Page 2-27</a> of the Launch Checklist.
001:55:17|Setting the Trans Lunar Inject (XLunar) switch on the MDC to tells the Instrument Unit that the crew are ready for TLI. At 42 seconds into TB-6 the IU will make the first of two checks to see the status of this switch.
001:55:24|The Launch Vehicle Emergency Detection System is powered up so that any failures in the S-IVB during the burn can be indicated to the crew. At this stage in the flight, there is no automatic abort option, so the crew would have to manually initiate separation of the CSM from the S-IVB
001:55:26|The Entry Monitoring System provides a secondary function of measuring velocity changes during the TLI burn and later SPS and RCS burns. During Entry, the output of the EMS's accelerometer is integrated twice to calculate the distance travelled by the CM after the entry interface. During engine burns, the accelerometer output is integrated once to calculate the velocity change (Delta-V) along the CM's X-axis. The electro-luminescent indicator can read up to 99,999.9 feet per second, with a precision of 0.1 foot per second. In each case, the crew set the desired Delta-V on the counter, which then counts down to zero.
001:55:26|The use of the EMS is a good example of system redundancy in the Apollo design. Changes in spacecraft velocity could be measured from the main CM Guidance and Nav inertial system, but this is more complex and liable to errors due to drift. The fixed EMS accelerometer provides a simple, reliable means of making this critical measurement. As another example of multiple use of the same system, the EMS display also provides an indication of the range between the CM and the LM during rendezvous operations, using the separate VHF radio ranging system.
001:55:26|The EMS Delta-V Test and Null Bias Check is carried out in accordance with <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmgc/2-5.gif" target="afj">Page G2-5</a> of the G&amp;C Checklist.
001:55:42|This value is set as part of the test; it is not related to the earlier PAD values.
001:55:51|While John Young carries on with the EMS test, Charlie Duke and Ken Mattingly ready the <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/acron.html#cmc" target="afj">CMC</a> for TLI using P15. This provides a back-up for initiation of the S-IVB ignition sequence, monitors the TLI burn if the IU is in control and provides automatic shutdown of the S-IVB if the CMC is in control.
001:56:35|Charlie Duke is reading the TLI PAD details to Ken Mattingly, who is then entering them in the DSKY. The first set of figures is the GET of Time Base 6, 2:23:57.
001:56:39|The target is between -0.1 and -41.5 feet per second, so the actual value is right in the middle of the range.
001:57:08|Verb 06 Noun 14 is the command to load the velocity change.
001:57:17|Not clear what John Young is referring to.
001:57:43|From the TLI PAD, the Indicated Velocity at S-IVB cut-off will be 35,589 feet per second (10,848 m/s).
001:59:14|From the TLI PAD, the change in velocity during the burn will be 10,373.0 feet per second (3,161.7 m/s).
002:00:12|John Young and Charlie Duke continue with the P15.
002:02:43|The crew are halfway down Page 2-27 of the Launch Checklist. However, they have become slightly out of order, and have carried out P15 without having carried out Verb 83. If they now call up the Verb 83 routine, they will lose the information they have stored in the CMC ready for the TLI burn. Without Verb 83, they will not have an exact pitch angle when they reset the ORDEAL.

002:03:00|Applying power to the two Rotational Controllers mounted on John Young's and Ken Mattingly's couch arms.

The Direct supply powers the direct switches which give the crew direct control of the RCS thrusters in event of a malfunction of the SCS. A more detailed description of the RCS and its controls will be given in the chapter on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/acron.html#tde" target="afj">TD&amp;E</a>.

002:03:17|The term "ullage" comes from the brewing industry, where it means the space above the beer in a brewer's vat., but in this context it means the volume in the spacecraft propellant tanks that is filled with helium gas. In a spacecraft, fuel will float freely in the tanks, unless it is constrained. However, it is essential that there are no bubbles of helium in the propellant before it is fed into the engines. In smaller tanks, such as those of the RCS, Teflon bladders are used to control the fuel and to separate it from the helium used to pressurise the tanks. But in larger tanks, such as the four main ones of the SPS, bladders cannot be used and so a short period of acceleration is required to force the fuel to the bottom of the tank (and the helium to the top) before the SPS fires. This acceleration is provided by the RCS firing for a few seconds. Normally, the SPS will command this automatically, but in event of a failure of the automatic system, the Direct Ullage switch on Panel 1 of the MDC provides a back-up capability for initiating the RCS ullage burn. The Direct Ullage Switch is backed up by two circuit breakers on Panel 8, which must be energised to enable the switch to work. A complex system, but necessary to provide the necessary safety.
002:03:17|It is not clear what the next conversation is about. John Young and Ken Mattingly seem to be discussing a deviation from the procedure. Possibly linked to the Verb 83 issue?
001:42:12|The crew have now completed <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-28.gif" target="afj">Page L2-28</a> of the Launch Checklist. Charlie Duke is highlighting the change in FDAI slew setting on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-29.gif" target="afj">Page L2-29</a> that was read up from Mission Control at 001:42:12
002:09:35|This may be a transcription error. The time for R2 ignition in the R2 ignition in the TLI PAD is 107.2, and John Young may be referring to this as "ten, seven, two".
002:09:57|John Young is reviewing the procedures on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16L2-28.gif" target="afj">Page L2-28</a>. During the S-IVB re-start sequence, the booster propellant tanks are pressurised. Because the tanks share a common bulkhead, any large difference in pressure could cause a catastrophic failure of the bulkhead, followed by an explosion of the booster. If the LOX pressure exceeds the LH<sub>2</sub> pressure by more than 36 psi, the LH<sub>2</sub> pressure exceeds the LOX pressure by more than 26 psi or the LOX tank pressure exceeds 50 psi, then the crew must carry out an emergency separation of the CSM from the S-IVB, as detailed on <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/csmlc/a16Lemer1-1.gif" target="afj">Page Emer 1-1</a>.
002:12:09|And back to more housekeeping, preparing the cabin for acceleration.
002:13:46|A number of the major systems on Apollo are operated by explosives. This provides a very reliable and low-weight means of achieving events such as separating the LM from the S-IVB, or of separating the docking ring from the CM to jettison the LM after docking in lunar orbit. As a down-side, they are one-shot devices that cannot be re-set if operated in error. With the SECS Pyro Arm circuit breakers live, all the relevant switches are also live. John Young is making sure that all the crew are aware of this, since even though the switches are guarded, it would be all too easy to press the wrong one and, for example, jettison the docking ring while leaving the LM attached to the S-IVB - thus losing any chance of a lunar landing. The two controls, although not adjacent, are on the same row of six switches. The even more important switches that jettison the SM from the CM are powered by different circuit breakers and are not live at this point.
002:13:46|A similar problem, but with even more serious potential consequences, faced the crew of Apollo 13 as they approached the Earth at the end of their calamitous mission. They had to jettison the SM from the CM, while keeping the LM attached until the last minute. The CMP, Jack Swigert, had to resort to sticking large labels on the two switches to make sure that he did not press the wrong one.
002:14:07|Ken Mattingly is referring to his life jacket.
002:14:24|Not clear what the discussion is about. Pro (Proceed) is normally the end of a CMC Program, so the crew may have not completed P15.
002:15:08|In zero gravity, the body has a natural tendancy to move its's fluids to the head, since the normal counterbalancing effect of gravity is removed. The sinuses also tend to fill, both due to increased leakage of fluid into them and because they do not drain normally. The result is a full-headed feeling and a swelling of the face.
002:16:10|Although the Launch Checklist shows the periods that the spacecraft will be in contact with the ground stations, it does not include the same for the ARIA.
002:17:19|In other words, the CM will separate from the S-IVB.
002:18:47|Five minutes to Time Base 6 start.
001:54:54|The crew are re-reading the checklist.

002:31:16|One minute, 15 seconds to S-IVB ignition.
002:31:30|On Launch Checklist Page L2-29, coming up for 58:15, 105 seconds to S-IVB ignition.
002:31:57|The DSKY display blanks for five seconds at 105 seconds before S-IVB ignition, while in P15.
001:41:45|To ensure that there is a record of spacecraft systems performance, even if the data link with Mission Control is lost during the TLI burn, Charlie Duke sets the Data Recorder Reproducer (DRR) - the CM's tape recorder - to High pulse-code modulation (or data bit rate), to Record and to Forward, to achieve the best recording conditions. He also resets the Up-Data Link equipment, and then sets it to Normal, in case Mission Control need to up-link any commands to the spacecraft. However, the crew still have the final control over up-link activity as the Up-Tlm switch is set to Block (see <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#001_41_45" target="afj">001:41:45</a>).
001:55:26|John Young sets the EMS to display the velocity change during the burn, as discussed at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#001_55_26" target="afj">001:55:26</a>
001:55:26|The S-II Sep light illuminates at Time Base 6, 58:36, two seconds before S-IVB APS starts thrusting in the ullage manoeuvre.
002:32:59|The spacecraft is over the Pacific, facing into the sunrise. Ken Mattingly is suggesting that John Young increase the brightness of the displays to help him read them
002:50:29|The engine start command is sent at 002:50:29.51 GET. The restart sequence is essentially identical to the start of the S-II stage's <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/01_Day1_Pt1.html#j2start" target="new" target="afj">J-2s</a> and of the first start of the S-IVB 's J2. The main difference is that fuel is allowed to run through the engine walls for eight seconds before the final ignition.

002:38:45|Mission Control cannot directly observe the vibration levels that the crew are sensing.
002:38:45|According to the AS-511 Flight Evaluation Report, "In a post-mission debriefing the Apollo 16 crew reported that the vehicle had experienced some low amplitude vibration or “buzz” during portions of the S-II stage burn, and throughout the S-IVB first and second burns. The crew also noted that the vibrations did not appear to be oriented in any particular axis. Analysis of flight data indicates the presence of low amplitude, approximately 65 hertz, vibration during the S-II stage burn and both S-IVB stage burns. The data show lateral amplitudes of ±0.10 g at the IU during S-IVB first burn and ±0.20 during second burn. The vibrations can also be seen on selected propulsion pressure measurements. A review of AS-510 [Apollo 15] data shows similar vibration at approximately 72 hertz. Because of the data characteristics, the vibration is suspected to be related to normal stage propulsion system operation and probably characteristic of the J-2 turbomachinery. These vibrations pose no pogo or any other structural concerns, and are of such low amplitude as to be virtually obscured in the measurement background noise." A rather bland engineering report on a phenomenon that gave the crew considerable concern!
002:39:31|According to the AS511 Flight Evaluation Report, "The S-IVB second burn time was 341.9 seconds, 2.4 seconds less than predicted. This difference is primarily due to the slightly higher S-IVB performance and lighter vehicle mass during the second burn". The lighter vehicle mass was due, in part, to a slightly longer (0.4 seconds) than anticipated first S-IVB burn, due in turn to lower than anticipated S-IC and S-II performance.
002:40:28|The crew are now at the top of Page L2-31, as they reconfigure the spacecraft after the successful TLI burn.
002:41:57|The CMC is now in P00, to update the State Vector.
002:43:31|Verb 66 sets the updated CMC State Vector into the LM Computer.
|Apollo 16 has completed the Trans Lunar Injection burn (TLI) of the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V booster. The S-IVB now holds only 2.75 tonnes of the 108.45 tonnes of propellant that it was launched with, the balance having been consumed to place the stage and the attached Apollo spacecraft on the long, three day ballistic coast to the Moon. The 40 metre long, 65 tonne "stack" of booster and spacecraft is travelling at 36,360 kilometres per hour, but is slowing down rapidly since it is still subject to approximately one quarter of Earth's surface gravity. It will continue to slow down until the Moon's gravitational pull exceeds that of the Earth, in about two days time.
|Inside the Command Module, John Young, Ken Mattingly and Charlie Duke are continuing to prepare to separate the Command and Service Modules (CSM) from the conical shroud known as the SLA, in 20 minutes time. (NASA sources of the time give varying meanings for this acronym; either Service Module/Lunar Module Adapter as in the Flight Plan or, more commonly, Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter.) This will then allow them to turn the CSM around, dock with the Lunar Module (LM) and extract it from the SLA. This is referred to as Transposition, Docking and Extraction (TD&amp;E)
003:03:09|At present, the on-board tape recorder is not selected on, so there is no transcript of the crew's discussions. The CM transcript will start at <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap16fj/#003_03_09" target="afj">003:03:09</a>, two minutes before separation. For now, we can only follow the crew's communications with Mission Control, where the CapCom is Gordon Fullerton, just as it has been through launch, Earth orbit and the TLI burn.
001:29:49|See 001:29:49 for a description of the four omni-directional S-Band antennae the crew are using to maintain communication with Mission Control.
002:41:50|After the TLI burn, at 002:41:50, the S-IVB and attached Apollo spacecraft was manoeuvred to the in-plane local horizontal. This involved a -25 degree pitch (down), and minus 1 degree yaw (left).Now, at 002:54:19, the stack is being commanded to manouevre +120 degrees (up), -40 degrees (yaw) and -180 degrees in roll. This will give the crew the optimum lighting conditions for the TD&amp;E.
002:55:12|In Mission Control, the EECOM is monitoring the cabin pressure, which has now reached the target of 5.7 pounds per square inch, gauge [39.3 kPa]. The crew will now close the Direct O<sub>2</sub> valve.
002:59:23|The S-IVB has completed its manoeuvre to the TD&amp;E attitude.
003:03:04|CM Transcript starts. The crew are on AOH Page 4-322, working through the TD&amp;E checklist.
003:05:00|<a name="csmslasep"></a>Separation of the CSM from the SLA is a fast but complex event. A train of explosive cords sever electrical connections between the Service Module and the S-IVB; they cut the metal structure joining the SM to the SLA to allow the spacecraft to come free; they cut the upper 75% of the conical SLA into four long sections which are now only joined to the S-IVB by spring loaded partial hinges at the centre of their lower edge; they set off pyrotechnic thrusters, mounted within the intact portion of the SLA, which force pistons to push on the outside edge of each SLA panel, causing them to begin rotating away from the enclosed Lunar Module. Once the panels have rotated about 45° from the centreline of the launch vehicle, the hinges disengage, allowing the springs within the hinge assembly to push the panels away at about 2.5 m/s, leaving the LM exposed on top of the Saturn's third stage.(A15FJ)
003:05:17|The crew are now working through Serial 5, placing the CSM in required post-separation configuration (AOH Vol 2 Page 4-325)
003:05:19|Checking that all SM RCS propellant valves and helium supply valves are closed.

265:25:04|Michael Collins did mention it during the Apollo 11 debrief. As the evaporator is the spacecraft's only means of cooling the electronics, it is operating at quite a high level. As a result, it produces enough thrust from the steam duct to affect the attitude and Ken can feel this as he returns to the entry attitude.
265:40:42|Ken Mattingly, from JSC Oral History Project:"Then after floating around and you realize that you’ve gotten so used to things, just set them out there. They’ll be there. You don’t need anything. All of a sudden there was a preference that 6 things kind of disappeared that way. Then the spacecraft would just kind of rock a little bit. You’re not feeling any Gs, but the spacecraft would rock, and you’d hear the jets try to fight it. So then they would come back in further, and then you started finding that, yes, indeed, you were laying against the couch now. As the g forces built up, you’re looking aft from the direction you’re going. Looking out the window, you started to see little color, light blue wisp, like a gas stove. It’s coming from around the side, and you see it as it goes off, because the gas is being ionized on a heat shield back here, and it’s flowing around. As the gs build up, this little wisp becomes a light until it gets so bright that I was tempted to put my hand up over the window so I could read the instruments. The instruments aren’t really well lit, but I was really putting my hand up here over the window so that I could see. It was this bright white light, and as the g forces eased off as you penetrate the atmosphere, the light went to dim until it kind of all went away.
265:49:50|Ken Mattingly, from JSC Oral History Project: "The most amazing thing was once the big chutes came out, looked out the window, right there was a helicopter. He was right there. You could wave at him and see him.

265:51:14|Ken Mattingly, from JSC Oral History Project: "Hit the water, rolled over. The procedure to get it right-side-up worked. One of my least favorite things was the emergency procedure for getting out upside-down. So, man, the swimmers were there, and they put the collar around the spacecraft. You’re really feeling just a sensation of elation. The swimmer had a beard, standing on his little raft outside the hatch. We opened the hatch, and I had gotten us there because I was &quot;Mr. Hatch.&quot; I opened this hatch, and I didn’t know what he was going to say, but something, and the next thing I know, this thing goes &quot;Wham!&quot; and it’s right back in my face. &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; I opened it again, and the guy said, &quot;Sorry.&quot; Okay. So we got out, put us in the chopper. We got back. They brought the spacecraft aboard and set it on the flight deck, went in and got cleaned up. I thought, well, I’ll go up on the flight deck and see what—I had this thing that, by golly, I’m going to walk around as much as I can before anybody sits me down and says I can’t. So I go up on the flight deck and see the swimmer team was up there. I recognized—I said, &quot;What happened out there with the hatch?&quot; He says, &quot;You don’t know?&quot; I said, &quot;No. What’s the matter?&quot; He says, &quot;Let me open the hatch.&quot; And the odor was unbelievable. Thank God our olfactory nerves disappear early in life. Living in a bathroom for ten days is not a desired position. Life magazine doesn’t tell you about those things. Boy, was that terrible.
