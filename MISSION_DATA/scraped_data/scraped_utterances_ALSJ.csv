104:03:07|T|LMP|Okay. Any words on that uplink, Jim?
104:03:10|C|Irw|Why don't you put in that yaw maneuver; yaw right 20 degrees, that might help.

104:30:19|T|CDR|- Double Spot. And we're about -
104:30:21|T|LMP|Okay, you got it.
104:30:22|C|Irw|That's better.
104:30:23|T|CDR|Okay. We're forward and to the north of Double Spot. I would guess about 200 meters to the north and maybe 150 meters to the west.
104:30:40|T|CDR|It's not flatlands, though, Houston.
104:30:42|C|Irw|Roger. I copy 200 meters north -
104:30:43|T|LMP|- attitude is super, though.
104:30:44|C|Irw|- of Double Spot and about 150 meters west.
104:30:58|T|LMP|That's good. Ascent pressures look good. Okay, Ascent Helium Monitor, cycle; I did. O2 Ascent -
104:31:05|T|CDR|-
104:31:16|T|CDR|I better go easy on this Landing Radar circuit breaker, huh?
104:31:19|T|LMP|Yeah, don't - Okay, that's the right one. Okay; camera's off. Ha, ha! Hey, it sure ain't flat, John. Wow! There's that ridge to the north.
104:31:33|T|CDR|Yep. Sure is.
104:31:35|T|LMP|All we got to do is jump out the hatch and we got plenty of rocks.
104:31:38|T|CDR|Houston, boy, it sure looks like you could make - I see Crown Crater from here; I can see Ray Crater from here. Not a - Boy!
104:31:49|T|LMP|I almost had apoplexy, that Program alarm, and that's your radar breaker.
104:31:54|T|CDR|Charlie's about had -  Charlie's got nothing but a ridge to look at.
104:31:59|C|Irw|Sounds beautiful, John. Wish I were there.
104:32:02|T|LMP|There's a ridge out in front  There's a ridge out in front of us, too, John.
104:32:07|T|CDR|Yeah. There's a ridge in front of us, one to the side of us, and my guess is that we're in a subdued old crater that's got a lot more craters .
104:32:16|C|Irw|Roger. We copy.
104:32:18|T|CDR|What a neat place.
104:32:21|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, this ridge in front of us does look like a subdued crater and it may be the raised rim about 50 meters in front of us, about, oh, 4 or 5 meters tall. About 30 or 40 percent of the surface is covered with boulders that are maybe half a meter in size. On out in front of us and to the right, where we landed, there were -
104:32:45|T|CDR|Wait a minute, Charlie.  We gonna stay, Houston?
104:32:48|C|Irw|Stand by.  Everything's looking okay up to this point, John. We'll give you a final word here shortly.
104:33:14|T|CDR|Okay. We were coming down pretty good until I hit the Stop button, and then it fell out. You know, the engine stopped.
104:33:22|C|Irw|I know exactly what you mean.
104:33:29|T|CDR|It's really nice to have your shadow out there; that's a good help. It's a good altitude gouge .
104:33:37|T|LMP|John, that was super.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> is updated. That's in. Batteries all looking good, EPS is looking good. Ascent quantities are looking -
104:33:58|T|CDR|The way these blocks are laid in here, out my window, I'd guess they come from South Ray. There's some biggies out there. We've got, right out in front of us about 100 meters, at my 10:30 position , I've got one that must be 3 meters across.
104:34:17|C|Irw|Orion, you're stay for T-1.
104:34:22|T|CDR|Understand.
104:34:23|T|LMP|Okay, stay for T-1. P68, John, and I'll get the AGS going. 414 plus 2 is in, 400 to 4.
104:34:40|T|LMP|Hey, Jim, hats off and a case of beer to FIDO . I'll tell you, that targeting was just beautiful.
104:34:46|T|CDR|Boy! You guys just started us right in there.  That was superb!
104:35:53|C|Irw|Very good.
104:35:02|T|CDR|- where it says we are. I believe it.
104:35:05|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, our Noun 43s are minus 896 -
104:35:08|C|Irw|We have them, Charlie.
104:35:10|T|LMP|- plus 1552.  Okay;  Engine Stop, Reset.
104:35:14|T|CDR|Okay; Engine Stop, Reset.
104:35:16|T|LMP|Okay. Pro.
104:35:17|T|CDR|Pro.
104:35:18|T|LMP|Call P12.
104:35:24|T|CDR|Go on in there, Charlie.
104:35:27|T|LMP|Okay.  Tig time for T-2 is 104 plus 42 plus 16.64. Pro.
104:35:52|T|LMP|Those numbers are good.
104:35:53|T|CDR|Those numbers are good?
104:35:54|T|LMP|Yep.
104:35:55|T|CDR|Outstanding.  Pro. It's Auto.
104:36:01|T|LMP|Auto.
104:36:03|T|CDR|Pro.
104:36:09|T|LMP|Okay; &quot;PGNS Mode Control, Noun 33&quot;, you got. 6 minutes, we're counting down.
104:36:16|T|CDR|Boy, this is really a nice place! Feel that one-sixth g, Charlie.
104:36:20|T|LMP|My restraint harness has got me anchored.
104:36:24|T|CDR|Oh, that's what the trouble is.
104:36:29|T|LMP|Okay, the AGS is set, 410. Standing by.  John, that was a sup!  It's just about level , we're not going to have a bit of trouble getting out -
104:36:57|T|CDR|Yeah, it's going to be neat. But it sure is not - It's not a smooth - It's not that FS smooth, Houston.
104:37:08|C|Irw|Say again, John.
104:37:12|T|CDR|It's not that FS smooth; we're in the middle of a block field.
104:37:16|C|Irw|Roger; we copy.
104:37:17|T|LMP|There's Crown Crater up there .
104:37:22|T|CDR|- little blocks. We may have squashed a few.
104:37:29|T|LMP|And, Jim, we got Crown Crater out John's left window about 9 o'clock.
104:37:34|C|Irw|Roger.
104:37:37|T|CDR|And just looking at it from here, I don't think the Rover's going to have any trouble going up that hill.
104:37:41|C|Irw|Glad to hear that.
104:37:45|T|CDR|I could be wrong. Slopes tend to fool you.
104:37:48|T|LMP|It looked good going North Ray, too. There were some big blocks on the rim but not - The track just looked good.
104:37:54|T|CDR|It looked good, huh?
104:37:55|T|LMP|Yeah. Uh-huh.
104:38:24|T|LMP|-
104:38:25|T|CDR|Turn on the water for a second, Charlie.
104:38:27|T|LMP|Okay, that's a good idea.
104:38:50|T|LMP|That shadow is not as long as I thought it was going to be. It looks like we're right on top of the ground.
104:39:00|T|CDR|Yeah, we didn't drop very far.
104:39:15|T|CDR|Man, we got a lot of rocks, that's for sure.
104:39:22|T|LMP|How's it looking, Jim?
104:39:24|C|Irw|It's still looking good. We're just standing by here -
104:39:51|C|Irw|We copy.
104:39:52|T|LMP|Every one of them are angular, too, John.
104:39:54|T|CDR|Yeah, they're all angular. They're out of South Ray, I believe.
104:39:58|T|LMP|There's a pretty one over there, without any dust on it at all. Out about 50 meters, by those three little craters?
104:40:07|T|CDR|Right  In fact, Houston, when I told you that I thought this terrain might be very spectacular; boy, I was just kidding. It really is something looking at that mountain. That is a big mountain, Charlie!
104:40:30|T|LMP|Yeah, we're within 2 minutes , John. Let's - I agree with you. It is really   Is that South Ray? That big bright - ? -
104:41:03|C|Irw|Orion, you're stay for T-2.
104:41:08|T|LMP|Rog; -
104:41:09|T|CDR|Okay - .
104:41:09|T|LMP|- Super.
104:41:10|T|CDR|- Thank you.
104:41:14|T|LMP|Stay for T-2. Okay; let's go to P00, and then ICS PTT .
104:41:26|C|Irw|Okay, Charlie, when you get the Surface Checklist, I have some changes that we want to take care of.
104:41:36|T|LMP|Stand by.
104:41:40|T|CDR|There probably are a few, aren't there?
104:41:47|T|CDR|Outstanding!
104:41:56|T|CDR|That one-sixth g is a lot nicer when you take the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../restraints.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">restraint harness</a> off.
104:42:44|T|LMP|Houston, are we Go for DPS vent?
104:42:49|C|Irw|That's affirmative. Go ahead.
104:43:14|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, Master Arm's On; two lights.
104:43:16|C|Irw|Roger.
104:43:20|T|CDR|Descent Vent's -  Descent Vent's, Fire.
104:43:23|C|Irw|Roger.  Our first change to the Surface Checklist occurs on 1-2, and copied Master Arm, Off.
104:43:41|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
104:43:45|C|Irw|Close Descent Reg 1.
104:43:53|T|CDR|Descent Reg 1, Closed.
104:43:57|C|Irw|Charlie, did you say you were ready to copy the changes?
104:44:03|T|LMP|Yes, sir; go ahead.
104:44:23|T|LMP|Okay, I copy.
104:45:00|T|LMP|Okay, we copy all that. Batt 3, Off/Reset; Batt Luny to Commander; talkback Commander; Batt 4, Off/Reset. Over.
104:46:00|C|Irw|That's correct.  Okay. Next page, 1- -
104:46:08|T|LMP|Is that everything?
104:46:10|C|Irw|- 5.  No, I've got a couple more, probably. Okay, on 1-5, on the fourth row, panel 16, Inverter 2, Open. Over.
104:46:26|T|LMP|Okay. Inverter 2 open. We got Inverter 2 powering the AC right now.
104:46:32|C|Irw|Okay. Well, part of our power-saving program is to not have the AC powered up, on the surface.
104:46:42|T|LMP|Okay. That's fine.
104:46:45|C|Irw|And the next change -
104:46:46|T|CDR|Somebody's got .
104:47:05|T|LMP|Okay. We copy &quot;Inverter, Off.&quot;
104:47:31|T|LMP|Okay, we get &quot;Track Mode, Off,&quot; &quot;S-Band to Best Omni.&quot;
104:47:34|C|Irw|And that's the end of the changes up to that point.
104:47:40|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, are we going to press on with the first rev checklist?
104:50:15|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. I have some more changes to that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/surface16.html" target="alsj">Surface Checklist</a> whenever it's convenient for someone to copy.
104:51:26|C|Irw|Orion, how do you read? Houston.
104:51:30|T|LMP|Loud and clear.
104:51:40|C|Irw|Okay -
104:51:41|T|LMP|- we're starting on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-2_3.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 1-2</a>, Jim.
104:52:02|T|LMP|That suits us.
104:52:04|T|CDR|You probably gathered we'd like to.
104:52:05|C|Irw|So would we!
104:52:08|T|CDR|Yeah. It's been a hard day's night for you, too.
104:52:10|C|Irw|You deserve a good sleep.
104:52:39|T|LMP|Jim, I feel exactly like I thought I was . I really want to get out, but I think that discretion is the better part of the valor here.
104:52:48|C|Irw|Good. Glad you think that.
104:52:58|T|CDR|Man, it's really tempting though. It really looks nice out there.
104:53:48|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. If you didn't get them, my 047 on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> was plus 37566; 053 was minus 73667.
104:54:00|C|Irw|Give me those values again, Charlie. I didn't copy them.
104:54:05|T|LMP|Plus 37566; minus 73667.
104:54:10|C|Irw|Roger. I copy.  Okay, Orion. We're ready to terminate the vent on the Ox-side.
104:54:37|T|LMP|Okay. It's going closed.
104:54:40|T|CDR|OX Vent's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#Barber_Pole" target="alsj">barber pole</a>.
104:54:42|C|Irw|Roger.
104:55:27|T|LMP|Jim, would you guys like to take 1 amp worth the power and let me see if I can get this steerable going. That landing might have knocked something loose.
104:55:38|C|Irw|Stand by.
104:55:57|T|CDR|cracked Charlie's fillings; we know that.
104:56:12|T|LMP|After you fly with Navy pilots for three years, you know what the feeling is.
104:56:14|C|Irw|Yeah, I know it exactly. I think we'd like for you to try to get the steerable up, if you can.
104:56:26|T|LMP|All right; we'll do that.
104:58:02|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. It didn't work. I was looking at the shadow, and the pitch goes around nicely. You can watch it move.
104:58:18|C|Irw|Okay. And we assume you got all the necessary circuit breakers in, AC and DC?
104:58:24|T|LMP|Roger. I put the AC Bus/S-Band in, and I put the S-Band Comm in, and the pitch moves fine, but the yaw does not move.
104:58:35|C|Irw|Okay. We copy.
104:58:41|T|LMP|I'm going to power it back down.
104:58:43|C|Irw|Okay.  Okay. And, Charlie, when you get a chance, if you're free, I can give you the rest of the changes coming up here in the next few hours.
104:59:20|C|Irw|Okay. I don't want you to, you know, introduce any light there that might hurt John, but the first change - and we're recommending perhaps you want to tear out a blank sheet of paper there so you can write down the sequences and the page number of these things, so you won't be confused.
104:59:48|T|LMP|It just so happens that the back of the Data Card Book is blank. Go ahead.
105:00:05|C|Irw|And if you'll look at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-8_9.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 1-9</a>, if you have it handy. Over.
105:00:17|T|LMP|Stand by.  Okay. I got it.
105:01:11|T|LMP|Okay. Copy. 2-1; then finish that page and go to 3-4.
105:01:18|C|Irw|That's right. And then, of course, sequence 3 is on page 3-4, and that's &quot;Doff suits.&quot;  And that &quot;Doff suit&quot; should occur at about 105:58, and, at that point, y'all be in a position in there where you can eat, and we can brief you on the rest of the surface plan. Over.
105:01:46|T|LMP|Rog. That sounds super, Jim. We'll press on with those changes, and in this briefing, we'd like a word about what our lunar stay looks like and et cetera.
105:01:59|C|Irw|Okay; we understand.
105:02:00|T|LMP|Sure y'all can get all that.  For some reason, it's remarkable, but once you sit down up here , the comm just clears up beautifully.
105:02:10|C|Irw|Very good.  Okay. Let's terminate the fuel vent, Orion.
105:02:36|T|CDR|Fuel Vent's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#Barber_Pole" target="alsj">barber pole</a>.
105:02:38|C|Irw|Roger.
105:02:48|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. You want to torque it?
105:02:51|C|Irw|Stand by.  Roger. Go ahead and torque, Orion. They look very good -
105:03:04|T|CDR|My angle difference was minus -  Okay. Boy, these are really neat optics. The Earth is in the window, and I'm looking right at the star. That's really good.
105:03:30|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. I have some parking angles for you for the IMU .
105:03:38|T|CDR|Roger. Go.
105:03:40|C|Irw|Okay. X is 286.25, Y is all zeros, Z is 087.57. Over.
105:03:55|T|LMP|286.25; all balls; 087.57.
105:04:00|C|Irw|That's a good readback.
105:04:07|T|LMP|Okay, Jim.  my 544 through 546, 544 changed quite a bit. It's minus now 0.116. 545 is plus 052. 546 is minus 0.068. That was after the cal. Before the cal, they were plus 006, and plus 045, minus 088. Over.
105:04:30|C|Irw|Roger. I have them, Charlie.
105:04:37|T|LMP|And I guess we're ready for the E-memory dump .
105:04:41|C|Irw|Stand by.
105:04:43|T|CDR|Say when, Houston.
105:04:54|C|Irw|Okay. We're ready for the E-memory dump.
105:05:00|T|CDR|It's on its way.
105:05:02|C|Irw|Roger.
105:05:06|T|LMP|And, Jim, that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> lunar align for a couple of minutes there put me within less than a 1/2 a degree from the PGNS.
105:05:15|C|Irw|Roger. We copy.  Orion, you're stay for T-3.
105:05:38|T|CDR|Roger. Stay for T-3.
105:06:16|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. The AGS is powered down.
105:06:18|C|Irw|Okay. I copy.
105:08:26|T|CDR|You really want to do this , don't you, Houston?
105:08:34|C|Irw|Go ahead, Orion.  Orion, this is Houston. Say again -
105:08:47|T|CDR|It works. It works.
105:08:52|C|Irw|What was that, John? What worked?
105:08:55|T|CDR|Goes right into Gimbal Lock.
105:08:58|C|Irw|Okay. Good show.
105:09:03|T|CDR|Yeah, I thought you'd like that.
105:09:58|C|Irw|Okay. We copy, and I have a T-17 through T-21 when you're ready to copy.
105:10:06|T|LMP|Go ahead.
105:10:07|C|Irw|114 plus 19 plus 10.65. Over.
105:10:53|T|CDR|106:25 plus 05.65. 18 is 108:23:36.87. 19 is 110:22:08.13. 20 is 112:20:39.04. 21 is 114 hours 19 minutes and 10.65 seconds.
105:11:29|T|LMP|Jim, I got a question for you. I'm on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 1-5</a>, my circuit breaker powerdown. Row 3, it has us pushing in - leaving the Primary S-Band and the Comm, Power Amp, and Transmitter/Receiver closed. We have them open right now. What would you prefer?
105:11:51|C|Irw|Stand by.  Okay, Charlie, leave those open.
105:12:19|T|LMP|Roger. And, also, the S-Band Antenna is open, and I'll leave that open. How about the Cabin Fan Control? Do you guys want that one closed?
105:12:29|C|Irw|Stand by.  Orion, go ahead and open that Cabin Fan Control.
105:13:01|T|LMP|Rog. It's open.
105:15:24|C|Irw|Okay, we copy.
105:15:34|T|LMP|Looks like you can see these blocks in the walls of that little crater. Looks like the thing is gonna be pretty blocky in the regolith.
105:15:45|C|Irw|Roger. We copy.
105:16:10|T|LMP|Houston, it really is bright outside. The surface looks almost white to me.  Okay, Jim. We're about to power down the AC .
105:16:41|C|Irw|Roger.
105:18:05|T|CDR|You want these MESA heaters on Hi, Houston, ?
105:18:10|C|Irw|Stand by.  Stand by. We're thinking about it.  Roger, Orion. Keep the MESA heaters on High.
105:19:20|T|CDR|MESA heaters on High.
105:22:29|T|LMP|Houston, the checklist says put Function Range to Range. It's in - . How do you want it?
105:22:39|C|Irw|I'm not reading you very well. Something you just did just caused a lot of noise down here.
105:22:45|T|LMP|We turned the Power Amp, Off.
105:22:57|T|CDR|- powerdown configuration - .
105:23:03|C|Irw|Okay, Orion, you better turn the Power Amp back On, so we can hear you a little better.
105:23:26|T|LMP|How do you read now, Jim?
105:23:28|C|Irw|Loud and clear, Charlie.
105:23:42|C|Irw|Stand by.  Okay, Orion. You can go to Range on that.
105:27:42|T|LMP|Jim, Houston. Over.
105:27:46|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie -
105:27:47|T|LMP|Correction. Jim, Orion.
105:27:50|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
105:27:51|T|LMP|It was a long day here. Could we doff the suits before we do the cabin configuration and all?
105:28:06|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine with us, Charlie. Go ahead.
105:28:11|T|LMP|Oh, hello there, Tony.
105:28:14|T|CDR|Yeah, that -
105:28:18|T|LMP|Thank you.
105:28:19|C|Eng|Really nice.
105:28:23|T|CDR|Man, wait until you see the rocks of this place.
105:28:25|C|Eng|I've been listening to you. It sounds great.
105:28:27|T|LMP|Tony -
105:28:29|T|CDR|It's going to be enough to make geophysicists sit up and crow.
105:28:33|C|Eng|You've already done that.
105:28:35|T|LMP|You've never seen so many rocks, Tony. Some biggies, too.
105:28:42|C|Eng|Really sounds fine. I'm getting green again. I tell you I wasn't green about 3 hours ago.  I'd say y'all earned your pay today.
105:29:04|T|CDR|All those guys in the trenches, that figured out all that, earned their pay today, I'll tell you that.
105:30:07|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. Tell John Covington that this thing is a piece of cake compared to his lightweight training unit.
105:30:15|C|Eng|Okay. I'll sure do that. He's running around here somewhere.
105:30:38|T|LMP|Be advised, Tony, we changed our mind on doffing suits . Since we got some stuff behind the ascent engine, we're gonna go through the normal configuration. We're doing the cabin configuration for stay now.
105:30:50|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
105:43:02|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're down to getting rid of the armrests . By the time we get this <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jettison bag</a> full, I don't know if we're going to be able to open the door.
105:43:26|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. My personal dosimer reads 21109.
105:43:35|C|Eng|Okay; 21109.  When I went through that jettison business, I felt like I was throwing away half the cabin.
105:43:59|T|CDR|Mine is 22050, Houston.
105:44:02|C|Eng|Okay; 22050.
105:44:29|C|Eng|Okay.
105:44:35|T|CDR|If we'd been smart, we'd have took them off at the first part of this thing.
105:44:42|C|Eng|Before you get your suits off there, you may want to bring that 500 millimeter forward from behind the engine cover there .
105:45:46|T|LMP|Tony, we're ahead of you. We already did that. And we got everything out from back here, and I'm putting up the ISS now, and John's getting his stuff off .
105:45:58|C|Eng|Good show.
105:53:18|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We've got three of us in here now; John's out of his suit.
105:53:25|C|Eng|And, I assume, all three are walking around.
105:53:41|T|LMP|Well, not exactly. One of them is sort of lying there .
105:55:08|T|LMP|Tony, are y'all getting the high-bit-rate data here now?
105:55:19|C|Eng|Yes, we do, Charlie.
105:55:25|T|LMP|Okay. John should be back up here .
105:55:29|T|CDR|Okay. I read you, Tony.
105:55:31|C|Eng|Very good, John.
105:55:42|T|CDR|I guess our opinion of this operation right about here is that the cooling is really marginal in the suits, and we'd like to get permission to get a shot of cold water through the suit loop, even with the power down situation, to keep us from sweating so much. Would that be okay? Whenever we're doing something in the suit, working in the cabin?
105:56:16|C|Eng|Okay. We have to talk about that here.  Yeah. There's no problem with that, John.
105:56:38|T|CDR|Well, thank you. Just a shot, you know, like maybe 30 seconds worth, at a clip.
105:57:10|C|Eng|Orion, Houston.
105:57:18|T|CDR|Go ahead, Tony.
105:57:20|C|Eng|Okay. On your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return </a>, we'd like to go to Auto.
105:57:28|T|CDR|Roger. Auto on the Cabin Gas Return.
105:57:32|C|Eng|Okay. And on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter </a>, to Cabin.
105:57:45|T|CDR|Okay, it's Push/Cabin.
105:57:46|C|Eng|Okay.
105:58:37|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We've got an ECS <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LM-6_panel2_H2O-SEP.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">H2O Sep light </a>. Isn't that because we got to go to Sep 2 or something while we're in this mode?
105:58:54|C|Eng|Copy, John. We're working it.
105:59:06|T|CDR|Yeah. The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ECSf6ASuitGasDiv.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter Valve</a> is chattering; it's making a sort of a purr.
106:00:08|C|Eng|Okay, John. We'd like you to switch water separators.
106:00:32|T|CDR|Okay. We're in Pull to Sep 2.
106:00:35|C|Eng|Okay.
106:03:31|T|CDR|Okay. We've still got a Water Separator light in here.
106:03:36|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
106:03:45|T|CDR|Let me tell you what our configuration is here. We're in Pull/Sep 2. The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return </a> is in Auto. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ECS-LiOH-Canister-Select.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">We're on primary LiOH cartridge.</a> The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_circuit_relief_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Circuit Relief </a> is in Auto. We're in Push to Cabin, and our hoses are stowed against the bulkhead.
106:04:03|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.  Okay, John. Separator speed is slowly climbing up there. It looks like it will make it up all right. It's just a bit slow.
106:04:27|T|CDR|Okay, fine.
106:05:26|C|Eng|Orion, Houston.
106:05:30|T|CDR|Speak, Tony.
106:05:34|C|Eng|Okay. They're thinking you may have the water-in-the-hose problem. They'd like you to drain the hoses down towards the floor. Maybe we can get some of that out of there. They'd also like you to hold your hand over the blue hose, to make sure you're getting good flow.
106:06:31|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm back up . How do you read?
106:06:32|C|Eng|Five by, Charlie.
106:06:36|T|LMP|Okay.  this <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a>, on the Push to Cabin, it sounds like to me that there's a flapper valve or something chattering back in there that is, sort of, perhaps stagnating the flow in the loop.
106:06:58|T|CDR|Yeah, that's what it sounds like to me, too.
106:07:16|C|Eng|Okay. Are you getting flow out of the blue hose?
106:07:30|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
106:07:31|T|CDR|We're getting it out of there, but I feel the same way that Charlie does. It's got something trapped in there.
106:07:38|C|Eng|Yeah. Okay.
106:07:40|T|CDR|And it 's coming out in pulses. Matter of fact, I can make it play what it sounds like for you.  Now what you hear there is the mike, right up against the hose and the hose blowing against the microphone. It's not a constant thing. It just sort of chattering like some valve in there is not doing its thing.
106:08:28|C|Eng|All right. We heard that, John.
106:08:45|T|CDR|Charlie's is the same way.
106:08:49|C|Eng|Okay, John. We'd like to go back to Egress on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter </a>, and give us a mark when you do it.
106:08:58|T|CDR|Okay. 3, 2, 1, Mark. Okay. That's Egress on the Suit Gas Diverter.
106:09:06|C|Eng|Okay.
106:09:11|T|CDR|Flow's good in Suit Gas Diverter.
106:09:14|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.  Okay. We understand. All your noise went away?
106:09:34|T|CDR|Yeah. It doesn't chatter any more in the Push to Cabin valve.
106:09:41|C|Eng|Okay.
106:11:46|T|CDR|Okay. The Suit Separator light is off now, of course.
106:11:50|C|Eng|Okay.
106:12:05|T|CDR|Charlie's got the 500 all configured and it works, which I'm not surprised since it was stowed like it was expected to hit a lot harder than we could.
106:12:19|C|Eng|Okay.
106:12:25|T|CDR|One of those 30g bags.
106:12:32|C|Eng|Well, it's nice to have a camera work.
106:12:57|C|Eng|Okay, John. At your convenience, we'd like to go back to Sep 1.
106:13:11|T|LMP|You got it.
106:13:13|C|Eng|Okay.
106:15:45|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm up to frame number 30 on mag A, Charlie's camera, and I just finished shooting sort of a partial pan out the front window. Man, this place is - It's not, anywhere, flat around here.
106:16:12|T|CDR|It's rolling terrain. And I really don't believe we're going to have any trouble at all getting up on the side of that hill , although the slope - I don't know, the slopes up toward Crown look like maybe 20 degrees. We'll have to take that very carefully.
106:16:31|C|Eng|Roger. What about -
106:16:36|T|CDR|That first bench is like about 10 degrees, but from there up to Cinco and Echo, it gets rather steep there.
106:16:45|C|Eng|How about boulders?
106:16:48|T|CDR|well, we landed in a block field, you know.
106:17:07|C|Eng|Right.  Can you see any up on Stone?
106:17:14|T|CDR|No. Sure don't. Yeah. Maybe there is. When we get closer to it, we'll be able to tell better. I see some funny shadows up on top of it.
106:17:25|C|Eng|Any problems in trafficability out on the EVA-1 direction ?
106:17:27|T|LMP|Tony, I -
106:17:34|T|CDR|It's gonna be a piece of cake, I think.
106:17:37|C|Eng|Beautiful.
106:17:40|T|LMP|Tony, the problem looks like finding a flat spot to deploy the ALSEP. It's just hummocky, rolling terrain with 4- or 5-meter ridges.
106:17:57|T|CDR|Yeah, 100 meters from here, it 's going to be on the side of a hill.
106:18:01|T|LMP|We can probably put it over to the left there, John. Tony, I looked out, down to about 4000 feet , assessing North Ray area. There were some large blocks, maybe 5 percent of the surface up around the rim. But, as you look back towards Palmetto, they really petered out in a hurry, and I think we're going to be in good shape going that way .
106:18:27|C|Eng|Good show.
106:18:32|T|LMP|One final comment here so I get back to work. About in my 1 o'clock position, about 30 meters out, just beyond the LM shadow - about twice as far as the LM shadow - there is a secondary crater with a large meter-sized block still in it. It looks like it formed the secondary, and it's got black and white - The top 3 percent or 5 percent of the block is black and white. Apparently, below that is solid white. Over.
106:19:03|C|Eng|Very good.
106:19:13|C|Eng|Is the crater round, or is it oblong? Can you get a direction?
106:20:03|C|Eng|Oh, come on. You always got it.
106:20:08|T|CDR|After about 2 or 3 hours, we always got it.
106:20:17|C|Eng|Are you through with your cabin prep there?
106:20:27|T|CDR|Charlie's loading the ETB . Can't but one guy do that at a time because it's too crowded over there.
106:20:32|C|Eng|Rog. Okay. The one thing we would like you to see if you could decide before you get out is where you would put ALSEP.
106:21:19|T|CDR|Well, we'll keep looking at it; but the trouble is, right in front of us, about 50 meters, there's a ridge, and I don't know what's on the other side of that ridge. Out about 100 meters, I can see a lot of blocks, but I can't tell whether there are craters out there or not, because we're at zero phase. I just don't think we could make a prediction at this point.
106:21:45|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
106:22:19|T|CDR|Those blocks around South Ray are about the whitest blocks I've ever seen, around the rim of that one.
106:22:53|T|LMP|Tony, that's affirmative. Blue-to-blue and red-to-red.
106:22:58|C|Eng|Okay.
106:22:59|T|LMP|That was on the wall. Now they are disconnected. The blues are disconnected at this point.
106:23:04|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.
106:25:11|C|Eng|Just to put your minds at rest a little bit about EVA-1, we're looking at a pretty nominal EVA-1. We'll probably give you some new targets for the UV camera, and we can do that real time. And we won't have the TV when you get out. We'll get it when you get the LCRU up. But otherwise, it looks pretty nominal right now.
106:25:43|T|CDR|Roger, Tony.
106:27:24|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I've got the EVA maps out and as I can gather here, we got two maps and one return chart. Is that what you agree with?
106:27:40|C|Eng|Okay; we'll work that a second.  Okay, Charlie. That looks good here.
106:28:28|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to optimistically leave the walking traverse map in the cabin.
106:28:34|C|Eng|All right.
106:31:45|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The ETB is stowed over in my corner.
106:31:49|C|Eng|Okay, very good.
106:32:08|T|LMP|And you know, in training, I could barely lift this thing, and, in one-sixth, it's one finger.
106:32:21|C|Eng|Just tells me we should do more work on the Moon.
106:32:26|T|LMP|Boy, I'll say.
106:33:31|T|LMP|How's the ECS looking to you now, Tony?
106:33:34|C|Eng|Right now, it's looking pretty good.
106:35:19|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We've done all of your sequence here. We got the suits off and stowed, the cabin configured, and I guess we're ready to go to an eat period and bed down. Okay?
106:35:42|T|LMP|Go ahead.
106:36:54|T|LMP|Stand by. Hey, you lost me, Tony. Okay. Here we go on page 3-7, Post-sleep. Go ahead.
106:37:54|T|LMP|We copy.
106:37:57|C|Eng|- Okay, and at the end of that page we'll go to page 2-5 .
106:38:07|T|LMP|Okay.
106:38:26|T|LMP|Okay. At 2-5, what was the time?
106:38:29|C|Eng|117:53.
106:38:36|T|LMP|Okay, copy. Let me go through this now.  Okay. We've doffed the PGAs. EVA debriefing with Houston comes next as step 2. Step 3 is the eat period.
106:39:00|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie.
106:39:01|T|LMP|Turn the page. Step 4 -  Go ahead.
106:39:05|C|Eng|Okay. Just to get our steps numbered straight here, I guess, assigning numbers to these things. Debriefing with Houston is step 4, eat period is step 5. And the times you read were right, and then the Pre-sleep is step 6 and each number goes on from there.
106:39:26|T|LMP|Okay. Pre-sleep is 6, then we wake up for post-sleep! And that's number 7.
106:39:33|C|Eng|Roger. Rest period is number 7.
106:39:36|T|LMP|And we got a -  Oh, okay; rest period is 7. I see. Okay. And then 8 is post-sleep?
106:39:46|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
106:39:50|T|LMP|And skipping the computer activity stuff, number 9 is the eat period; and we delete the &quot;top-off the PLSS&quot;; we turn the page, we skip - Well, we skip EVA-2 planning; we turn the page and that step, don suits, is next.
106:40:11|C|Eng|Right; that's number 10.
106:40:13|T|LMP|And that's step 10.  Okay. Then we go to 2-5, and we're just about back to nominal, then.
106:40:23|C|Eng|Rog. And that's step 11 on 2-5.
106:40:28|T|LMP|Copy.
106:40:32|C|Eng|Okay, have a good meal.
106:40:36|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Let's do the debriefing. We don't really - I'd like to describe for a LM window description. We had so much practice at that, I'd like to see how I could do.
106:40:50|C|Eng|Have at it. We'll take any words you've got. We expended all our questions a few minutes ago with John, and in fact I didn't even have to ask any; he just answered them all. But press on.
106:41:04|T|LMP|Okay. Looking out at 12 o'clock on the horizon, there is a very hilly, subdued region - well, let's say hilly terrain - at 12 o'clock that goes on out of view around to 11. It's rolling with white pockmarked craters there, and I'd say that's maybe 50 to 100 meters above the surrounding terrain where we are.
106:44:26|C|Eng|Very good, Charlie. Where again was this boulder with the fillet?
106:44:33|T|LMP|It's at about 2:30, maybe a couple of hundred meters out, and it's on this side of the ridge that trends east-west here, that blocks out Smoky.
106:44:45|C|Eng|Okay. Could it be sliding down the ridge, and that's why the fillet's on the south?
106:44:52|T|LMP|That might be the reason. I was just going to say, it's downslope so that might have been what happened.
106:44:58|C|Eng|Very good.
106:45:00|T|LMP|Though the slope doesn't appear that steep, Tony.
106:45:05|C|Eng|Okay. How about the Buster area? Can you identify that?
106:45:10|T|LMP|Boy, that's really -  We sure saw it on descent. I don't see it right now. There's a bright crater to the right, maybe 50 meters of what I think is Spook, which is probably Buster, but I really wouldn't swear to it.
106:45:31|C|Eng|Okay. Can you tell boulders over there?
106:45:37|T|LMP|There's not a one, as far as I can see.
106:45:40|C|Eng|Okay.  Very good, Charlie. You're right up to your old peak.
106:46:48|C|Eng|Very good. You were mentioning the boulders and the rays from South Ray. The ray itself, could you map out what extent it was, or was it just the whole general area?
106:47:02|T|LMP|It was a pretty wide ray coming across here. I would say it goes from our position perhaps to Spook. And maybe behind us maybe another 100 meters or so.
106:47:15|C|Eng|Very good. How about left-right extent, did it go all the way back to South Ray?
106:47:23|T|LMP|Well, you'll have to ask John that. I couldn't see out that way. As we - The biggest block that I saw was one we flew over which is maybe 100 meters to 200 meters behind us, and it looked like Volkswagen size.
106:47:41|C|Eng|Very good.
106:47:47|T|LMP|John is off comm momentarily. He'll be back up in a little bit, and I'm going to start the chow.
106:48:05|T|LMP|And, Tony, I wouldn't give you 2 cents for that orange juice as a hair tonic; it mats it down completely.
106:48:14|C|Eng|We'd like to go your Suit Gas Return back to Cabin. Give it a try.
106:48:23|T|LMP|Okay. We'll try it in Cabin. We also tried this in orbit and we got the same sound, Tony. We're going to Cabin now. Mark.  Okay, it gives us the same sound.
106:48:40|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like to go back to Egress.
106:48:45|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. I tell you what it is. I just opened the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return </a> and it stopped it . What it was is that the Cabin Gas Return check valve is not working right. The flow is great now.  Our configuration is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter </a>, Push-Cabin, and Cabin Gas Return to Open, and everything sounds normal.
106:49:25|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like to leave you that way.
106:49:51|C|Eng|We're working that one.
106:50:12|C|Eng|Okay.
106:50:13|T|LMP|I got day 5, meal B.
106:50:15|C|Eng|I guess we'd like you to just go ahead with your first lunar meal. I guess that deserves some champagne, I don't know.
106:50:26|T|LMP|Well, like John said earlier, we're definitely not going to get scurvy; we've got so much orange drink here.
106:50:34|C|Eng|Rog.
106:51:19|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're going to eat day 5, meal B.
106:51:30|C|Eng|Okay. Was that Dog?
106:51:38|T|LMP|Bravo, as in &quot;boy.&quot;
106:51:39|C|Eng|Rog.
106:52:30|T|LMP|Houston, John finally found his spoon.
106:52:34|C|Eng|Very good!
106:53:09|T|CDR|Hello, Tony.  back on comm.  Tony?
106:53:25|C|Eng|Go ahead.
106:53:30|T|CDR|I can't see how far the rays - I just assumed that this is a block field we're in from South Ray. It goes about 100 meters out at 10 o'clock and goes over a ridge and disappears. The next time I see it, is at South Ray, which is, you know, pretty far away from here . South Ray is a doggone interesting crater. I wish we could get to it.
106:53:55|T|CDR|Cove, Trap -  Stubby, Wreck, Trap, and it works into Cove, Eden Valley, and into Spook and from Spook off those small craters into <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Double Spot</a>. And, I think we ended up landing right by one of the smaller craters that sort of form a hook off the north side of Spook, going back into Double Spot, and I think we're about 50 meters from it at 9 o'clock, but -
106:55:44|C|Eng|Very good. How about the albedo?
106:55:46|T|CDR|I can't -
106:55:48|C|Eng|How about the albedo?
106:55:55|T|CDR|Tremendous difference in albedo. On the - North Ray is pure white; South Ray is pure white; and it blends into a gray ; and then over here by us, it's almost totally gray. I guess you just get the feeling that these rocks may have come from somewhere else . There's a big subangular rock that I see at 10 o'clock - no, at 11 o'clock at about 100 meters - that I would sure like to go over and look, because it looks like it's just one big piece of whatever rock it is.
106:56:36|C|Eng|Right; I was wondering about -
106:56:37|T|CDR|Oh, and I do happen to see a white clast in the bottom of it.
106:56:42|C|Eng|I was wondering about the albedo on your surface chart, on the strips and things, whether the rays are as obvious as they are on the high-Sun-angle chart that you're carrying, or whether they look very much different at your low Sun angle.
106:56:58|T|CDR|No, they're not, I don't think. I can see from here down to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Survey Ridge </a> and the albedo on there is a lot lighter. It's a general - gradual downslope from our landing point to Survey Ridge, and it looks like it drops maybe a hundred meters and then starts to go right back up Smoky Mountain . I guess you could see on a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">contour map</a> where the low spot is.
106:57:37|C|Eng|Okay -
106:57:38|T|CDR|But there are some strange looking craters over there on Stone Mountain , and the albedo contrast is really pronounced in those craters. There's some -  It may be a function of shadow, we better wait until we get over there. I hesitate to say, they almost look like big -  Well, they must be impact craters, I guess.
106:58:07|C|Eng|Okay. I was just wondering about whether you could recognize whether you're on a ray by albedo as well as the boulder content.
106:58:20|T|CDR|I think you're going to be able to; but, boy, you're not going to pick up a contact; it just tails out into something.
106:58:30|C|Eng|Outstanding, that's better than I thought.
106:58:36|T|CDR|You ought to be able to work across the contact.
106:58:40|T|CDR|But you mainly would do it by the white boulders in the ray, I think. I can see, on ridge lines, from here, I can see three different rays out of South Ray, I believe.  have to go down there and look at them to make sure. They seem to be riding on the ridge lines, although that's probably deceptive because I can't see down in the holes.
106:59:05|T|LMP|Tony, one other comment from my side. Distances are pretty deceiving here for me. I'm looking out over John's shoulder, and it looks like to me you could throw a rock into South Ray from our present position - which is, I know, impossible.
106:59:45|T|LMP|A second comment has to do with the orbital, since we got so much look at the ground sailing around waiting to come down. Everywhere we saw the ground - which is just about the whole sunlit side - in the crater walls and on the ridges, we had the same lineation that the Apollo 15 photography showed on Hadley Delta and Hadley Mountain . It was really remarkable how, in the crater walls, primarily, and in the ridges - .And it gave you the impression that it was a fracture pattern that was all trending parallel to the - concentric around the craters. In the craters - And on the ridge, though, they were sort of either parallel to the ground or at some dip, be what that may. Over.
107:00:26|C|Eng|Okay, very good.
107:00:31|T|CDR|And I'm looking out here at Stone Mountain, and I got a picture of it . And it looks like it's got - Looks like somebody has been out there plowing across the side of it. The benches just look like one sort of terrace right after another, right up the side. And they sort of follow the contour of it right around.
107:00:51|C|Eng|Any differences in the terraces?
107:00:58|T|CDR|No, Tony, not that I can tell from here. Those terraces could be rays out of Stubby or something like that.
107:01:06|C|Eng|Okay. You mentioned two different rock types.
107:01:10|T|CDR|I can see Stubby has - Right at the edge of Stone, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Stubby</a> has got much steeper walls going off of Stone Mountain than I originally imagined it. It's -  I don't think Stone Mountain came up to Stubby and stops.
107:01:40|C|Eng|Okay.  You think Stubby is punched into the edge -
107:01:42|T|LMP|Do y'all have a next -
107:01:45|T|CDR|Well, that's my guess from here but there again, the thing is so steep that the whole side of Stone Mountain, right now, from - A good half of it is in shadow.
107:01:59|C|Eng|Okay.  Go ahead, Charlie. One thing; you mentioned two rock types: the black and white ones and then the all white ones. Do you see anything else?
107:02:13|T|LMP|Yeah, there was one right out in front of the LM here, just to the right of the footpad that looks like a breccia to me, Tony. Either that or an indurated regolith . We'll tell you when we get out.
107:02:30|C|Eng|Okay.
107:02:45|T|LMP|Tony, we'll give you an analogy of what that black and white rock looks like. It's really a gray and white and looks like a granitic rock with very large crystals to it, though I kind of doubt that .
107:03:05|C|Eng|Outstanding! You're really whetting our appetites.
107:03:13|T|CDR|There are really some interesting rocks out here. I see some that are pure snow white. And we've got the whole run of them. It's hard to tell at this sunlight, which is so bright on the surface, just exactly what color these things are, even with the naked eye. You know, it's very deceptive. I swear I see one out there with some pink in it, but we'd better wait until we get out. We'll pick it up and make sure.
107:03:42|C|Eng|Roger. I understand.
107:03:48|T|LMP|What do you call tomato soup made with cold water, Tony?
107:03:52|C|Eng|Awful.
107:04:00|T|LMP|John says 'cold tomato soup'.
107:04:36|C|Eng|Hey, Charlie. When you get a chance, could you take a look at that ridge at 12 o'clock, which you described as 50 to 100 meters out, and see if that continues on around to 10 and 9?
107:04:50|T|CDR|Yes, it does.
107:04:53|C|Eng|Okay, could you -
107:04:54|T|CDR|It continues on around to my side.
107:04:57|T|LMP|John's original observation was that it looked like we're in a big old subdued crater, and that's really what it looks like, Tony.
107:05:05|C|Eng|Okay.
107:05:14|T|LMP|Man, those black and white rocks really look interesting, Tony. I just can't wait to grab one of those.
107:05:24|C|Eng|I tell you, Charlie, we feel the same way.
107:05:37|T|CDR|Oh, Charlie!
107:05:56|T|LMP|Tony, I guess it's really a bluish cast instead of real black to me. But in this Sun it looks bluish.
107:06:05|C|Eng|Right, we understand.
107:06:14|T|CDR|Well, we'll bring you a small one of each. I'll tell you one thing, I'm glad we brought the rake, because we really can do it.
107:06:21|C|Eng|Very good.
107:06:25|T|CDR|We can get a rake sample out in front of the lunar module with one scoop.
107:06:33|C|Eng|Okay. And when you get a chance, we'd like you to stow those hoses. I guess we don't have enough friction in there, and the water separators are running wild.
107:06:10|C|Eng|Okay. And if you can pull yourselves away from the window there, we'd like you to hold to the schedule of starting pre-sleep in about 20 minutes.
107:07:11|T|CDR|How can we start pre-sleep in 20 minutes when we haven't even gotten to eat yet, Tony? For goodness sake.
107:07:21|C|Eng|[Chuckling] Okay.  Hey, the back room gave you a bravo on your descriptions there.
107:07:39|T|LMP|I'm like a little kid on Christmas Eve, Tony.
107:07:42|T|LM Crew|-
107:07:47|T|CDR|It really is neat to have a gravity field around to set stuff on. That is really the cat's meow.
107:07:59|T|LMP|Okay. The hoses are hooked back up, Tony. You should see some decrease in the separator .
107:08:04|C|Eng|Okay.  I think I know how you feel, Charlie. I'm pretty turned on myself.
107:12:38|T|LMP|Tony, how is Casper doing?
107:12:42|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
107:12:48|T|LMP|How is Casper doing?
107:12:52|C|Eng|Everything's fine up there. I just looked over occasionally. You've been keeping me so occupied here, but they've got no problems.
107:13:00|T|CDR|Super. Boy, you can't imagine how nice this one-sixth gravity is. This is the first time I've been able to eat soup without knowing whether I was going to eat it or take a bath in it.
107:15:04|T|LMP|And, Tony, John and I'd just like to give our thanks to the backroom guys and everybody that worked so hard on Casper's problem, giving us a chance to get here.
107:15:18|C|Eng|Rog, Charlie. I think everybody around here appreciates their job.
107:15:37|T|CDR|Gee, I'm sure glad somebody was able to come to that conclusion, because it sure looked black there for a while, didn't it?
107:15:44|C|Eng|You betcha.
107:16:01|T|CDR|I'd like to get somebody to put in the word to the Big Sim Troop in the sky and tell Him to let's make it a little more nominal from here on out.
107:16:09|C|Eng|I'm all for that.  That was too much like a Sim.
107:19:58|C|Eng|Orion, Houston.
107:20:04|T|CDR|Go ahead, Tony.
107:20:05|C|Eng|Would you verify that the O2 demand Regs are in Cabin?
107:20:17|T|CDR|That's verified.
107:20:22|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. It looked like the pressure was dropping down a little bit.
107:21:54|T|CDR|Okay, Tony. Thank you.
107:21:58|C|Eng|Okay.
107:21:59|T|CDR|Okay. In other words, we're going to wake up twice tonight already, huh?
107:22:05|C|Eng|Yeah, probably. The first one should go off before you get to bed, though. But that second one will probably come on just before you should wake up.
107:22:17|T|CDR|Okay.  How much sleep from the time when we start to bed do you want us to get?
107:22:29|C|Eng|Eight hours.
107:22:34|T|CDR|Understand, an 8-hour rest period.
107:22:42|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're about to fill the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="alsj">drink bags</a> , and what we're going to do is refill the ones we had this morning, and use just plain water. Over.  Copy that, Tony?
107:23:22|C|Eng|All right, copy that. We're just wondering why you're not using the Gatorade?  Okay, or &quot;orange juice&quot;.
107:23:34|T|LMP|Well, we drank one bag.  The stuff we filled from the Command Module this morning we drank. And that leaves us with two bags for two subsequent EVAs. And we could fill one of the other bags and just drink water on the third or whatever you want us to do.
107:24:00|C|Eng|Oh, we don't care. Do whatever you want there. Water's fine.
107:24:08|T|LMP|Yeah, I think we'd rather save the fortified stuff 'til the last.
107:31:39|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. What's our GET right now?
107:31:44|C|Eng|107:31.
107:31:48|T|LMP|Okay. Who do you want on biomed tonight?
107:31:56|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. It's your turn.
107:32:01|T|LMP|That's what I was afraid of.
107:32:03|T|LMP|Okay. You've been looking at me since landing so we'll just stay right here.
107:32:12|C|Eng|Okay.  Okay, while you're worrying about that, your comm configuration for the night will be S-Band Power Amplifier, Secondary, as present. The Telemetry will be Low; Voice will be Down Voice Backup, Range will be Off and, as I said, you're on biomed.
107:32:41|T|LMP|Okay, go through that again.
107:32:44|C|Eng|Okay, it's S-Band Power Amplifier, Secondary, as present; Telemetry, Low; Voice will be Down-Voice Backup; Range, Off; and you're on biomed.
107:33:06|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we have Down-Voice Backup, biomed right, Telemetry, Low. How did you read?
107:33:18|C|Eng|Okay, you're pretty weak there for a second Charlie. Try it again.
107:33:25|T|LMP|Okay, Down Voice Backup, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Over.
107:33:31|C|Eng|Okay, that's much better.
107:38:04|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston.
107:38:10|T|LMP|Go ahead.
107:38:11|C|Eng|Okay, at your convenience, I have some changes to your emergency lift-off checklist in the Surface Checklist. Just give me a call when you're ready to take it.
107:38:25|T|LMP|Stand by.
107:40:59|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm ready to copy, if you'll give me a page.
107:41:16|T|LMP|Okay, you speak.
107:41:19|C|Eng|Okay, on the PGNS activation; it's down in the bottom left-hand side. The last entry there is &quot;Pro and hold until Standby light off.&quot; Cross that line out.  And add the line underneath &quot;CB or circuit breaker panel 11 </a> ), LGC/DSKY - close.&quot;
107:42:01|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
107:42:03|C|Eng|Okay, on the second column, they have a correction to the checklist, it says &quot;Circuit 16&quot; - &quot;Circuit breaker panel 16 ) and Inverter 1, close.&quot; That should read &quot;Circuit breaker panel 11 Inverter 1, close.&quot; Then we'd like to insert -
107:42:21|T|LMP|Okay, got it.
107:42:23|C|Eng|Okay, and we'd like to insert, underneath that line, &quot;Circuit breaker panel 16, Inverter 2, Close&quot; and &quot;Inverter switch to 2&quot;.
107:42:42|T|LMP|Okay, Inverter to 2, and cross out Inverter 1.
107:42:51|C|Eng|Right. Okay on 11-2, underneath - On the left-hand, upper side you have &quot;Asterisk CB 11 and 16&quot;. Underneath that line write in &quot;T-ephemeris update, if available for MSFN.&quot;
107:43:33|T|LMP|Okay, is that an up-link or do we load?
107:43:37|C|Eng|Stand by.
107:43:58|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. John thinks it's Verb 25 Noun 07 Enter, 1706 Enter, and then load the ephemeris, and I think that's correct.
107:44:31|C|Eng|Roger, Charlie; that's correct.
107:44:38|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead. Any other words?
107:44:40|C|Eng|Right. On your circuit breaker configuration here, I've got some that will be open and you might as well note that they will be open and that's okay. So on 11-3 - . Panel 11, first line there, S-band antenna will be open.
107:45:11|T|LMP|Keep going.
107:45:13|C|Eng|Okay. And on 11-4, fourth line, panel 16, S-band antenna will be open.
107:45:28|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
107:45:30|C|Eng|Okay, and we go on to 11-6 now. You have the setup for your steerable antenna and you can just cross all that out; and that's the end of it.
107:45:44|T|LMP|Okay. We copy all of those updates. The only one I don't understand is on 11-1, on the PGNS activation. We crossed out the Pro and added an LGC /DSKY closed and right before that it says LGC/DSKY closed.
107:46:09|C|Eng|Okay. You're right. That's an error on our part. Just cancel out our addition.
107:46:17|T|LMP|Okay. No problem. I just thought maybe something went by me, there.
107:46:21|C|Eng|Right.
107:46:23|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, if that's everything, we're ready to go to bed.
107:46:26|C|Eng|Good show.  Okay, we're through with everything here, and we're all set to let you go to bed. You're going to bed, I'll have you know, a whole 6 minutes early. I guess the government can allow you to have that time off.
107:47:30|T|LMP|Okay. I'll be on comm. John will be off comm, and we're going to turn off the lights now.
107:47:42|C|Eng|Okay. We'll see you tomorrow, and we're sure looking forward to it.
107:48:33|T|LMP|Cabin Gas Return, Open.
107:48:43|C|Eng|Okay, that looks good here.
107:49:19|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we'd like to thank everybody for the great job of regrouping, and getting back to what seems to be pretty nominal from now on. And we'll see you in the morning. I guess you can give us a reveille call over the squawk box here. Over.
107:49:38|C|Eng|Okay, I'll sure do that. I'll come in and I'll whistle something here.
107:49:45|T|LMP|All right. Good night.
107:49:46|C|Eng|Good night.
107:52:14|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
107:52:17|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
107:52:22|T|LMP|Well, I guess I can't stop talking. One final observation, Tony, is that due to the lack of dust that we had on landing and the fact that we can see blocks embedded in the side of these craters, here, I kind of got the distinct impression that the regolith is not too thick around here. And we ought to maybe think about where would be the thickest place in order to get the drill in. Over.
107:52:53|C|Eng|Okay. That's a good observation. From the films you've seen of other descents, do you think the dust was less than any of the others?
107:53:03|T|LMP|Well, John will have to really comment on that. But as far as my side goes, the little I looked out, there was by far - We could see, or, I could, on my side, see right on down through it to touchdown.
107:53:18|C|Eng|Okay, and from listening to your descent, it sounded like you picked it up about 90 feet.
107:53:26|T|LMP|It was a little bit less than that. It was about 80, maybe 75.
107:53:41|C|Eng|I have a feeling you and I could just sit up all night and talk about this.
107:53:47|T|LMP|Well, that's all you're going to hear from me. Good night.
107:53:51|C|Eng|Okay, good night.
108:00:15|T|CDR|Tony, you guys missed it by about 10 minutes. The RCS Reg A light just came on.
112:32:45|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; Orion. Over.
112:32:50|C|Pet|Orion, Houston. Go ahead.
112:32:57|T|LMP|Hey, you know, a bit ago we had a little MA-RCS problem - . The system A - now shows a 10 to 15 percent quantity. Is that what you guys were expecting? Over.
112:33:14|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
112:33:20|T|LMP|Okay. If y'all are happy, we'll see you in a couple of hours and go back to sleep. Over.
112:33:26|C|Pet|Say again, Charlie. You're very garbled.
112:33:34|T|LMP|Okay. If you guys are happy, we'll go back to sleep.
112:33:50|C|Pet|All right, Charlie. We've got one circuit breaker we want you to open. Stand by a minute.  Rendezvous Radar, Operate, panel 11, row 3, under Heaters.
112:34:09|T|LMP|Okay, we got it. Good night.
112:34:11|C|Pet|Roger. Thank you.
115:50:21|C|Eng|Good morning, Charlie; it's nice to hear your voice.
115:50:35|C|Eng|Hold on, I'll check.  Okay; yes, I guess we did. Why, did you get keying there?
115:51:09|C|Eng|Okay. The docs over here say, yeah, you did.
115:51:18|T|LMP|Yeah.
115:51:54|C|Eng|Okay, we're ready; go ahead.
115:51:58|T|LMP|Okay. For John on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM11Menu.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">day 5, meal B</a>, scratch the rye bread. He did not eat the rye bread. Ate everything else, and add a food stick into that also. For my meal, I ate everything but the rye bread; and add a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="alsj">drink bag and a food stick</a>. That's the EVA beverage . Add that and the food stick. For medication, John had none, and he got 7-1/2 hours of good sleep. And for me, I had a Seconal and I slept for about 6-1/2 or 7 hours, I think; and it was real good. Over.
115:52:58|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that. Sound real fine. You mean you got John to eat one of those <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="alsj">food sticks</a>?
115:53:06|T|LMP|Believe it or not.
115:53:08|C|Eng|Outstanding!
115:53:16|T|LMP|In fact, he was sleeping so great that I just woke him up just a second ago, as a matter of fact. I couldn't stand it any longer.
115:53:33|C|Eng|Very good. Well, you're right on the timeline. It's wake up time.
115:53:56|T|LMP|Houston, we're ready to copy our lift-off times. Over.
115:54:05|C|Eng|Okay. Stand by one.  Okay, Charlie. We've got the block data for the LM lift-off, LM Timeline Book.
115:55:22|T|LMP|You speak.
115:56:27|T|LMP|116 plus 29 plus 51; 118 plus 28 plus 22; 120 plus 26 plus 55; 122 plus 25 plus 28; 124 plus 24 plus 00; 126 plus 22 plus 32; and that assumes the GET update of 11 minutes and 48 seconds for Casper. Over.
115:56:54|C|Eng|Okay. That's a good readback. And we have an update to your Lunar Surface Checklist.
115:57:03|T|LMP|Go ahead.
115:57:05|C|Eng|Okay; on 11-1.
115:57:14|T|LMP|Go ahead.
115:57:15|C|Eng|Okay; I guess we were too quick last night in crossing out that &quot;Pro, Hold until standby light off.&quot; We'd like you to put that back in.
115:57:27|T|LMP|Okay. Don't worry, we'd've done that. Thank you much.
115:57:32|C|Eng|Okay; and then on page 11-2.
115:57:44|T|LMP|Stand by.
115:57:45|C|Eng|Okay.
115:57:56|T|LMP|Go ahead.
115:57:58|C|Eng|R1, 00011; R2, 13346; R3, 25621.
115:58:38|T|LMP|Okay; say R1 and R2 again.
115:58:40|C|Eng|Okay; R1, 00011; R2, 13346.
115:59:01|T|LMP|Okay; note is &quot;T-ephemeris to be used only in event of LGC/CMC clock sync.&quot; Rl, 00011; R2, 13346; R3, 25621. And that's that we got loaded, or is that what we'd load if you wanted us to sync up?
115:59:28|C|Eng|Okay; that's what you'd have to load to sync up after they fix the CSM time.
115:59:35|T|LMP|Okay; thank you much.
115:59:37|C|Eng|Okay; and that's the end of that. And I'll brief you on the traverse whenever you're ready.
115:59:42|T|LMP|Let John get on the comm. It'll be a couple of minutes. We're going into the eat period, and we'll give you a call while we're eating.
115:59:53|C|Eng|All right.
116:12:46|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Good morning.
116:12:48|C|Eng|Good morning, John.
116:12:57|T|CDR|Did you work all night too, Tony?
116:12:59|C|Eng|No, no. I've been home and sacked out.
116:13:06|T|CDR|Good.
116:13:11|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead with your EVA stuff.
116:13:12|C|Eng|Okay.  Now these are the Backroom's best guess. The Spook sampling may be compromised by that ray from South Ray that you described, and since we're mostly interested in local Cayley on EVA-1, you'll probably have to spend a little time trying to differentiate between secondaries coming in from South Ray and local material. You described most of the Ray material as being very angular. One of the clues may be rounded blocks, for local material. At Flag , again, you may have that same problem. Since we couldn't see over there, we really couldn't tell; and we don't want you to feel bound to Plum Crater there at Flag; if there's another place on the rim of Flag where you're more likely to get local material, feel free to head for it.
116:14:15|T|CDR|Okay; will do. But the color of the ray material is a pretty good gouge ; it's all white.
116:14:24|C|Eng|Right. And the -
116:14:26|T|CDR|At least, I think it is. That's the way it -
116:14:29|C|Eng|I'm sorry, John; go ahead.
116:14:35|T|CDR|It sure looked all white at pitchover, there.
116:14:39|C|Eng|Right. And I guess we'd like you to go ahead on a normal EVA-1 there, and not worry too much about the local blocks in the LM-ALSEP area. We'll try to pick them up at the end of EVA-1 or at Station 10 in EVA-2.
116:14:59|T|CDR|Roger.
116:15:42|T|CDR|Okay.
116:15:43|C|Eng|- give you real-time updates on that.
116:15:48|T|CDR|Okay. I guess we're going to have to put the UV a little closer to the vehicle because of the current - Probably won't make a lot of difference there.
116:15:59|C|Eng|Okay. And if you guys are all for it and everything, we're still trying to crowd in three EVAs.
116:16:11|T|LMP|What do you mean, are we all for it?!
116:16:15|C|Eng|Well, I just thought I'd give you a chance to put your vote in.
116:16:25|T|CDR|I'm not for crowding 'em in, but let's do three of them!
116:17:08|T|LMP|Tony, Charlie. Please pass on to the ALFMED P.I. in the Science Room that you can see those light flashes on the lunar surface just like Translunar coast, and you can also see them in the lunar orbit. During the sleep periods. Over.
116:17:28|C|Eng|Okay, did you notice any change in frequency?
116:17:34|T|LMP|They're about the same as the - They're less than that experiment we ran , but they were about the same as they were in lunar orbit.
116:17:42|C|Eng|Okay; understand. They were less than in the experiment, but about the same as in orbit.
116:17:51|T|LMP|Yeah, and I think there was about - Let me say, I maybe saw 10 before I went to sleep, and I think I got to sleep pretty fast. So, they aren't really too numerous, but you can see them.
116:18:06|C|Eng|Okay, very good.
116:42:25|C|Eng|I'm sorry, John. Say again?
116:42:28|T|CDR|I say, we're down to 117 hours and 3 minutes . We're ready to don suits. What time have you got?
116:42:36|C|Eng|116:42.
116:42:38|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to go ahead and do it, with the understanding that when we get them donned and get the PLSS on, we'll depress and go ahead and get out, because we don't have a very good way to keep time in here.
116:42:53|C|Eng|Okay; understand. We do have a procedure here. We'd like for you to mess with your steerable antenna a little bit, there.
116:43:07|T|CDR|Okay, do you want me to do that now?
116:43:09|T|LMP|Yeah, let's do it.
116:43:11|C|Eng|If you're ready.
116:43:15|T|CDR|We're ready.
116:43:18|C|Eng|Okay. Circuit breaker panel 11 </a> ), AC Bus B, S-Band <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../sband.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Antenna</a>, Close.
116:43:26|T|CDR|It's closed.
116:43:27|C|Eng|Okay. Panel 16 ), on the Comm, S-Band Antenna, closed.
116:43:35|T|CDR|Closed.
116:43:37|C|Eng|Displays, closed.
116:43:40|T|CDR|Displays, closed.
116:43:41|C|Eng|And Heaters, S-Band Antenna, closed.
116:43:47|T|CDR|S-Band Antenna Heater breaker, closed.
116:43:49|C|Eng|Okay. On the steerable manual controls, match the indicated angles.
116:43:57|T|CDR|Okay.
116:44:01|C|Eng|Okay; the Track Mode to Slew.
116:44:14|T|CDR|Track Mode to Slew.
116:44:15|C|Eng|Stand by a second, please.
116:44:43|T|LMP|I think it might be working, John. I just got a jump on my needle here.
116:44:51|T|CDR|On the yaw needle?
116:44:52|T|LMP|Yeah. It's always been stuck on 12 before, and now it's on minus 75. But it doesn't look like it's 75 out there. Of course, you don't know with the pitch.
116:45:15|T|CDR|Okay; what do you want to do with it now, Houston?
116:45:18|C|Eng|Stand by one on that. We're working on another problem here.
116:45:28|T|CDR|Working another problem?
116:45:30|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like you to close Inverter 2 circuit breaker, and select Inverter 2.
116:45:40|T|LMP|Okay, you got it.  That's what I was afraid of. Now it's back to 12.
116:45:51|C|Eng|Okay; we'll press on with the procedure here. We had the Track Mode to Slew, set the Pitch control knob fully counter-clockwise.
116:46:02|T|LMP|It is.
116:46:04|C|Eng|Okay; Track Mode, Off.
116:46:10|T|LMP|It's Off.
116:46:12|C|Eng|Okay, now set both Pitch and Yaw knobs fully clockwise.
116:46:21|T|LMP|It is.
116:46:23|C|Eng|Okay; go to Track Mode, Slew.
116:46:31|T|LMP|Okay - .
116:46:32|C|Eng|Let us know.
116:46:33|T|LMP|- And the antenna didn't move.
116:46:39|C|Eng|Okay; we understand. It did not move.
116:46:45|T|LMP|Negative; either in pitch or yaw.
116:47:02|C|Eng|Okay. Look on your panel 16, and see if the S-Band Antenna circuit breaker's open or closed.
116:47:10|T|LMP|It's closed.   What a bunch of bullshit! Dadgone it -
116:47:36|C|Eng|Okay; we're just going to back out of that procedure. Let's go Track Mode, Off.
116:47:48|T|CDR|It did something in yaw then, Charlie.
116:47:51|C|Eng|And match the indicated angles; Track Mode switch, Slew.
116:48:01|T|LMP|Tony, with the Track Mode to Off, both indicators are minus 75
116:48:10|C|Eng|Okay.  Okay. Set your Pitch at 180 and the Yaw at minus 12.
116:48:32|T|LMP|It's set.
116:48:35|C|Eng|Okay. And go through, and we'll pull the circuit breakers that you have set for this procedure. That's on panel 11, S-Band Antenna, Closed. Pull it open.
116:48:48|T|CDR|Okay, it's open.
116:48:49|C|Eng|Okay. On 16, S-Band Antenna, open.
116:48:51|T|CDR|Okay, Tony.
116:48:54|C|Eng|Okay, John?
116:48:57|T|LMP|Go ahead.
116:48:58|C|Eng|Okay, the S-Band Antenna, open.
116:48:59|T|LMP|Go ahead.
116:49:00|C|Eng|Okay. Displays, open; and the Heaters, open.
116:49:04|T|LMP|It's open.
116:49:05|C|Eng|Okay. Inverter 2 circuit breaker, open; and Inverter 2, Off.
116:49:14|T|LMP|Rog. That's done.
116:49:16|C|Eng|Okay, let's press on with your suits.
116:49:21|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. What are the nominal angles for lock-on error and - on this attitude?
116:49:32|C|Eng|I'll get those.
116:49:41|T|LMP|Okay.  -
116:49:47|C|Eng|Okay. The 180 and minus 12 we gave you should be good angles.  And that's for photography, not for lockon. We're going to have you take a picture of it when you get out.
116:50:07|T|CDR|Roger.
116:50:09|T|CDR|When Charlie moves the needles in yaw, he can get it to oscillate - plus or minus what? - plus or minus 3 degrees.  The antenna doesn't sound like it's moving. I thought it sounded jiggly.  Whatcha doing now, Charlie?
116:50:50|C|Eng|Okay, John and Charlie. We'd like you to press on with the EVA work. If we mess with that S-band any more, we'll do after the EVA. I've got a note here. I don't know whether it's right or not, but it says that you won't be able to hear the yaw motor.
116:51:16|T|CDR|Okay; but Charlie is looking at it out the window, and it's not moving.
116:51:22|C|Eng|Okay. There's a latching mechanism in the thing there that should have released when the thing was unstowed, and we're going to try to have you take a picture of it. There's a lever that pokes out there, and we can tell from the picture whether that latch released. And there should be a little bit of slop in there so -
116:51:38|T|CDR|I understand.
116:51:40|C|Eng|- maybe he could drive it a little bit.
116:52:05|T|CDR|Okay.  cuff checklist. Where's that at?
116:54:26|T|CDR|You should see me hold up this 50-pound pressure suit with one hand while Charlie is unzipping it with one hand. That's really neat.
116:54:38|C|Eng|Right. You should bring some of that one-sixth g back here.
116:54:51|T|CDR|Yeah. You Earth people don't know how nice this is.
116:58:29|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston.
116:58:36|T|CDR|Charlie is putting on his suit. I'll talk to you.
116:58:38|C|Eng|Okay. If it's not too late on Charlie's helmet there, the suit people just want to make sure that he washes it out with water to get that orange juice out before he puts that anti-fogging stuff in there .
116:58:55|T|CDR|It's never too late to do something like that. We'll do it.
116:58:58|C|Eng|Okay.
116:59:02|T|CDR|We could've done it last night, you assholes!  They want you to wash it off with water before you put the anti-fog in there. Did you wash it?
116:59:10|T|LMP|Huh?
116:59:27|C|Eng|Roger, John. We copy that.
116:59:36|T|CDR|What did I say?
116:59:47|C|Eng|Roger. We're just noting your hot mike.
116:59:57|T|LMP|Are we on mike?
117:00:01|C|Eng|Yes, you sure are.
117:00:52|T|CDR|- push to - lock mechanism's sure sticky.
117:01:08|T|LMP|- . Won't move.
117:01:26|T|CDR|Do you all want to be in Down Voice, or do you want to go Normal voice?
117:01:32|C|Eng|Stand by one.
117:05:09|T|CDR|Charlie's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ApolloPRD.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">PRD</a> reads 21111; , 2 and four l's.
117:05:20|C|Eng|Okay; 2 and four l's.
117:07:08|C|Eng|Orion, Houston.
117:07:16|T|LMP|Go ahead.
117:07:19|C|Eng|Verify Aft omni.
117:07:24|T|CDR|Aft omni, Charlie.
117:07:28|T|LMP|We're on Aft omni.
117:07:30|C|Eng|Okay.
117:12:39|T|LMP|- Break it, because there's no way for a human being to get the crinkle out of there because he ain't got three hands. Four hands would do a good job. Two to hold - one to pull on the zipper and two to hold the crinkle -
117:13:04|C|Eng|Orion, Houston.
117:13:09|T|LMP|Go ahead.
117:13:10|C|Eng|At your convenience, we'd like you to switch LiOH canisters and jettison the used one.
117:13:22|T|LMP|Okay.
117:13:24|T|CDR|You want to switch the LiOH canisters and jettison the used ones.
117:13:28|C|Eng|And we have some changes to your Surface Checklist and your EVA Cue Cards.
117:13:38|T|LMP|No, but they go in.
117:13:41|T|CDR|Report, Charlie -
117:13:44|T|CDR|Go ahead.
117:13:47|C|Eng|And leave the brackets for the LiOH canister.
117:13:52|T|CDR|Understand, leave the brackets for the LiOH canister.
117:13:55|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
117:14:00|T|CDR|Okay.
117:14:06|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead with the changes.
117:14:11|C|Eng|Okay, on your EVA-1 Cue Card.
117:14:18|T|LMP|Go ahead.
117:14:19|T|CDR|Plug in your water, Charlie.
117:14:21|C|Eng|On the right -
117:14:22|T|CDR|Now, don't give me that -
117:14:24|C|Eng|Modulate - FM.&quot;
117:14:37|T|LMP|EVA-1 prep, right-hand column. Okay. &quot;Modulate - FM.&quot;
117:14:47|C|Eng|Okay.
117:14:48|T|LMP|What did you want to change it to?
117:14:49|C|Eng|Right. We want to delete the &quot;Modulate - FM&quot; and delete &quot;Power Amplifier - Primary.&quot;
117:14:59|T|LMP|Okay.
117:15:00|C|Eng|Okay, about halfway down that column under comm, it says &quot;Telemetry Biomed, Off.&quot;
117:15:13|T|LMP|Yep. Yep.
117:15:16|C|Eng|Okay, delete that &quot;Telemetry Biomed, Off,&quot; and two lines later, it says &quot;Recorder, On.&quot; Delete that line also.
117:15:24|T|LMP|Okay. What else?
117:15:34|C|Eng|Okay, stand by a second.
117:15:44|T|CDR|- water. Yeah.
117:16:04|T|LMP|Yeah, that's right.
117:16:06|T|CDR|It's hard to beat.
117:16:07|T|LMP|- ?
117:16:11|T|CDR|No, they want to do it now. Okay, Houston, we're in secondary. On that LiOH canister, Charlie's changing now.
117:16:28|C|Eng|Oh, okay.
117:16:31|T|CDR|You do that, Charlie. It'd be so much easier.
117:16:34|T|LMP|What CDR comm have you got?
117:16:56|C|Eng|Okay, John, on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">back side</a> of that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1PrepPostCard2.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">EVA-1 and the EVA Post </a>.
117:17:04|T|CDR|Okay.
117:17:06|C|Eng|Okay, it's on the bottom half of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">card</a>, left-hand column, third line up. It says &quot;Telemetry Biomed, Left.&quot;
117:17:17|T|CDR|Okay.
117:17:18|C|Eng|Delete that line.
117:17:30|T|CDR|Okay.
117:17:31|C|Eng|Okay, go to your Surface Checklist, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 3-4</a>.
117:17:39|T|CDR|Okay, Surface Checklist, page 3-4.
117:17:51|T|CDR|Go ahead.
117:17:54|C|Eng|Telemetry PCM, Low.&quot; Delete that line. And delete - and delete the next line, &quot;S-Band Voice - Down Voice Backup.&quot; Delete that also.
117:18:20|T|CDR|I wasn't going to stick it in there until you got that thing and it's shut, Charlie.
117:18:25|T|LMP|Okay.
117:18:26|C|Eng|Okay, John. We've got very poor comm; we're going to drop the link for a minute here. We'll be back in a minute.
117:18:34|T|CDR|Okay, I missed all you said about that page 3-4. You read me?
117:18:43|C|Eng|Roger. I do now. I'll come back to you in a minute, and we'll do 3-4 again.
117:18:49|T|CDR|Okay. Philosophically speaking, I would like to get all these changes in before one or the other of us puts on a pressure suit because - because the - We're in an energy conservation mode of operation, and I'd like to keep it that way.
117:19:04|C|Eng|Right. I sure do agree with you, John.
117:19:56|T|CDR|Okay. Okay, Houston, the LiOH canister is changed, and we're back on primary.
117:20:07|C|Eng|Okay, we copy.
117:20:19|T|CDR|- Charlie? Okay, Charlie's got his suit on and he's all laced up, and he's got a shot of water.
117:20:33|C|Eng|Very good.
117:20:35|T|CDR|Yeah, it was terrific; how I know it. Want to go ahead with the checklist changes or you want me to don my suit?
117:20:46|C|Eng|I'm trying to get an answer here.
117:21:53|T|LMP|Got it in?  - around here.
117:21:57|T|CDR|Roger.
117:22:05|T|LMP|Yeah, - over with my suit.
117:22:10|T|CDR|Okay.
117:22:58|C|Eng|Okay, John, on the checklist.
117:23:06|T|CDR|Go ahead.
117:23:08|C|Eng|Okay. On <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 3-4</a>, the bottom left-hand two lines. &quot;Telemetry PCM, Low&quot; and &quot;S-Band Down Voice Backup.&quot;
117:23:20|T|CDR|-
117:23:22|C|Eng|Delete both lines.
117:23:24|T|CDR|Surface Checklist, Charlie.
117:23:32|T|LMP|We copy.
117:23:33|C|Eng|Okay, on the right-hand column of 3-4, the third line from the bottom, it says &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return </a>, Auto.&quot; Change that to &quot;Open.&quot;
117:23:46|T|CDR|- Flight Data File.  - Flight Data File.
117:24:00|C|Eng|Did you get that, Charlie?
117:24:04|T|LMP|I copy.
117:24:05|C|Eng|Okay, on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-6_7.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 3-6</a>, the fifth line from the bottom in the left-hand column. It says &quot;Cabin Gas Return, Auto.&quot; Change that to &quot;Open&quot; also.
117:24:26|T|LMP|Okay, Tony.
117:24:29|C|Eng|Okay, we've got it for now. Later on, we'll have to change the cue cards for EVA-2 and 3 and - But that's the extent of the checklist change. We've got one note here for you. We're going to have a change to the material - the gear - that you bring up during the transfer on the EVA-1, and I'll catch you before you go up and remind you about it.
117:24:54|T|LMP|Okay, thanks.  - put a - on it, and we'll - later.
117:24:59|C|Eng|Okay, good show.
117:26:03|T|CDR|- verify.
117:26:10|T|LMP|I hope I won't ever have to do that.
117:26:23|T|LMP|Here's - center.
117:26:26|T|CDR|Okay.
117:26:27|T|LMP|Okay, 14 -  Hey?
117:26:33|T|CDR|Yeah.
117:27:13|T|CDR|Okay. It's off first.
117:27:34|T|LMP|Bigger than me.
117:27:37|T|CDR|You're not as big as I am.
117:27:47|T|CDR|Okay.
117:28:28|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, going off comm.
117:30:18|T|LMP|Tony, -  John -
117:30:30|C|Eng|Charlie, you're very weak. Say again.
117:31:32|T|LMP|- it's up.
117:35:26|T|LMP|-  How do you read? Over.
117:35:37|C|Eng|Orion, Houston. Go ahead.
117:35:41|T|LMP|-  Okay. You guys reading us?
117:35:45|C|Eng|You're very weak, Charlie.
117:35:51|T|LMP|How's that?
117:35:58|C|Eng|You're still weak. I think we can copy you, though.
117:36:47|T|LMP|Okay, you'd better think about - on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../PLSSComm.pdf" target="alsj">PLSS comm</a> check. We're thinking maybe we could sort of go with - you guys when we get out on the surface.
117:36:59|C|Eng|Right. How are you copying us, Charlie?
117:37:09|T|LMP|You're loud and clear, Tony.
117:37:10|C|Eng|Okay.
117:37:12|T|LMP|Have been, all through this procedure.
117:38:33|C|Eng|And, Charlie, we'd like to remind you to dry out your helmet pretty good before you put that anti-fog on.
117:38:39|T|LMP|-
117:38:53|T|LMP|-
117:39:11|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. You've got 6000 pounds of source pressure.  - think it makes any difference.
117:39:30|T|CDR|No matter whose you get out, it's going to be cluttered.
117:39:33|T|LMP|Right.
117:39:55|T|CDR|There you go, Charlie.
117:40:07|C|Eng|Okay, Orion. We're going to have a site handover; maybe our comm will get a little bit better.
117:40:14|T|CDR|Okay. Hey, and look what I forgot to do.  - yet.
117:40:44|T|CDR|Charlie, you can -
117:40:47|T|LMP|Zip?
117:40:48|T|CDR|Yeah.
117:41:39|C|Eng|Orion, Houston. We'd like to try the Normal voice; maybe it'll help.
117:42:38|C|Eng|Orion, Houston. How do you copy us?
117:42:54|T|CDR|Loud and clear.
117:42:58|C|Eng|Now, we can hear you down there, but you are too weak to use there. Stand by 1. We better go back to a Down Voice Backup.
117:43:43|T|CDR|- have to.
117:43:57|T|CDR|Yep. Okay.
117:44:06|T|LMP|-
117:44:07|T|CDR|I think it's all right, Charlie.
117:44:12|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. Down Voice Backup. How do you read?
117:44:17|C|Eng|You're very weak there, Charlie. We'll have to press with it this way.
117:44:46|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Why don't you read them up there? - OPS check for - values. Yep.  - OPS check - I don't understand that - pressure.
117:45:19|T|CDR|What are you doing?
117:45:21|T|LMP|-
117:45:26|T|CDR|Okay.
117:45:32|T|LMP|You're out of sync.
117:45:34|T|CDR|Yeah, we're out of sync, but you're supposed to be going back up there.

117:50:08|T|CDR|Okay. Whew. Let's go - Either go on spacecraft hoses or use the water. Let's go on spacecraft hoses, okay? So do I. Why don't we run the water?
117:50:38|T|LMP|- have to switch the - to off.
117:50:42|T|CDR|Yeah. And don't take long. One of them. Okay. Okay. That's good, isn't it? Cool it.
117:51:10|T|LMP|-
117:51:18|T|CDR|Okay, that should do it.
117:51:22|T|LMP|-  Oh, I -
117:51:25|T|CDR|-
117:51:42|T|CDR|Here's your tissue.

117:52:05|T|CDR|-
117:52:20|T|CDR|-
117:52:36|T|CDR|You'd better give me your scissors - I'm over here on the -
117:53:31|T|LMP|Here's one for you and one for me. First stuff I've spilled since I've been here.
117:53:54|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're down to 1585 on the -
117:54:07|C|Eng|Charlie, this is Houston. We're having a hard time copying you. John's a little bit better there. Would you check that your mikes are up to your mouths or have John say it?
117:54:19|T|LMP|Okay, Tony.
117:54:30|T|CDR|Our mike is up to our mouths - mouth.
117:54:33|C|Eng|Okay, that's a little better.

117:55:52|T|LMP|How we doing on the timeline, Tony?
117:55:59|T|CDR|Tony, how are we doing on time?
117:56:04|C|Eng|Looks like you're a little bit ahead right now.
117:56:10|T|CDR|Okay.
117:56:23|C|Eng|Your comm check should come in about 25 minutes.
117:56:30|T|CDR|Okay. We don't really have a feeling for that even though we've probably got a watch here; we're not - we're not able to watch it.
117:56:38|C|Eng|Roger. I understand that. When you get a chance, we'd like to put the lunar battery on the LMP's bus.
117:56:47|T|CDR|Understand. Lunar Batt on the LMP's bus.
117:56:52|C|Eng|Right. If you want to, I'll just read the procedure.
117:56:55|T|CDR|They want the lunar bat on your bus, Charlie. Okay, go.
117:56:59|C|Eng|Okay. The steps we've got here are Batt 2, Off/Reset, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#TalkBack" target="alsj">talkback</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#Barber_Pole" target="alsj">barber pole</a>; Batt L - LMP, On; talkback, LMP; Batt 2, Off/Reset, talkback barber pole.
117:57:18|T|CDR|Charlie says that'll drop power - on the commander's bus. Probably won't hurt anything.
117:57:26|C|Eng|Okay.
117:57:31|T|LMP|Is that okay with you guys to do that?
117:57:48|T|CDR|What are you hinting there, Charlie?
117:57:50|T|LMP|- LMP -
117:57:57|T|CDR|Okay. How come you're not talking to them?
117:58:05|T|LMP|Can you hear me?
117:58:06|T|CDR|No.
117:58:08|C|Eng|Yeah, Charlie. We're just not - not reading you well enough to understand what you're saying there.
117:58:30|T|LMP|- ?
117:58:31|T|CDR|No.
117:58:33|T|LMP|How do you read now, Tony?
117:58:36|C|Eng|I can hear you, Charlie, because I know what you're saying. But if you say anything different, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to copy.
117:58:44|T|CDR|Let me cover up my mike.
117:58:47|T|LMP|How do you read now, Tony?
117:58:49|C|Eng|About the same.
117:59:04|T|CDR|Do I sound pretty bad too, Tony?
117:59:10|C|Eng|Say again, John?
117:59:15|T|CDR|Do I sound pretty bad? I must. What we're trying to find out is if we have a comm problem before we start getting into this any further.
117:59:27|C|Eng|Right; we understand. Would you verify that you've done the battery management on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-8_9.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">3-9</a>?
117:59:38|T|CDR|You did the battery management, right?
117:59:40|T|LMP|Yeah, it's done.
117:59:44|T|CDR|That's completed, Houston.   &quot;Stow <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>&quot;.

118:01:43|T|LMP|- push in, push in - way in.
118:02:01|T|CDR|Yep. I don't think - No, it won't push anymore than that. See, it won't ride up over this thing here. We'll do it whenever we get there.
118:02:20|T|LMP|If we can get it open.
118:02:21|T|CDR|Okay, but - We can get it open. You don't get the handle all the way open. It'll never come any further than this, Charlie.
118:02:28|T|LMP|You sure about that?
118:02:30|T|CDR|No, that's unlocked right there. Have to remove that -
118:02:46|T|LMP|-

118:25:57|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, Charlie.
118:25:58|T|LMP|-  I can't help it.
118:26:02|T|CDR|Oh.

118:29:37|T|CDR|Hello, Houston.  How do you read? Over.
118:29:39|C|Eng|Okay, John. You sound good but, again, you're weak also.
118:29:47|T|CDR|Okay, I'm hollering as loud as I can. And my microphones are right in my mouth.
118:29:53|C|Eng|Right. I can hear it bounce against your tonsils.
118:29:54|T|CDR|You're loud and clear, Houston.
118:29:59|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to AR now. How do you read now, Houston?

118:58:46|T|LMP|I'll give it to you. Okay?

118:58:53|T|LMP|Okay. Fine. You can't get back in that  corner?  No, sideways, like I am. You ain't going to be able to get out unless you can get around! There you go.
118:59:08|T|CDR|Okay, but that's as far as I go.
118:59:13|T|LMP|- , but that's what we're going to have to do. Okay, you get out and I'll put in the -  I've still got a flag A. You do, too. Okay, yours just cleared; so did mine.  Didn't mine clear?
118:59:33|T|CDR|You don't have any flags, Charlie.
118:59:37|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, the H2O flags have just cleared.
118:59:42|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
118:59:52|T|CDR|Okay, shall we go to Intermediate on the cooling and see if it's working.  It's working.
119:00:05|T|LMP|Houston. Can we go to Intermediate on the cooling?
119:00:14|C|Eng|Rog. That's okay.
119:00:20|T|LMP|I feel mine working.
119:00:21|T|CDR|I do, too.
119:00:22|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, are we ready to get out? We're ready to get out.
119:00:28|T|CDR|Yeah.
119:00:31|C|Eng|Okay. Let's go.
119:00:34|T|LMP|Okay, why don't you go out, John?
119:00:37|T|CDR|Okay, give me the ETB, Charlie.
119:00:39|T|LMP|I'll give you that when you get out . Okay?
119:00:40|T|CDR|Got to get my PLSS antenna, right?
119:00:42|T|LMP|No, not 'til I - not now. That comes later.  Okay, check your feet out. Okay, your PLSS is partially over under the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="alsj">purse</a>. Come this way a little bit. Okay. You've got your PLSS hung up. Your right corner is on the door over there. Throw your rear end to - There you go! You got it.
119:01:23|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie.
119:01:24|T|LMP|Okay. Can you stay there on the porch?
119:01:28|T|CDR|Yeah, wait a minute. I can get the ETB now.
119:01:31|T|LMP|Okay, that's the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>.
119:01:33|T|CDR|Okay; well, let me get it.
119:01:41|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay. There you go.
119:01:47|T|CDR|Okay. Okay, Houston; I'm standing out on the porch. I've got the ETB in one hand, and we're just sort of looking around here. My golly, what a view! I can see the big boulders Charlie was talking about .
119:02:06|T|LMP|How far back is it?
119:02:07|T|CDR|-
119:02:15|T|LMP|Hey, Houston. How do you read us? Over.
119:02:24|C|Eng|Okay. You sound good there.
119:02:28|T|LMP|Okay; John's I guess about out.
119:02:31|T|CDR|Yeah, I'm about out, Houston.
119:02:33|C|Eng|Very good.
119:02:34|T|LMP|Out on the porch.
119:02:41|T|CDR|I'll take the old ETB, and go down the steps here, Charlie.
119:02:43|T|LMP|Okay.
119:03:02|T|CDR|Boy! Isn't that nice? I tell you, the ETB is hanging right in there.  It sets it on the ground.
119:03:14|T|LMP|Are you on the ground?
119:03:16|T|CDR|No, the ETB is, though.
119:03:18|T|LMP|It's touching the ground?!
119:03:19|T|CDR|Yeah.
119:03:20|C|Eng|And, John, verify you got the MESA.
119:03:26|T|CDR|Oh, yeah. I've got to get the MESA. Excuse me.
119:03:39|T|CDR|There goes the MESA!
119:03:40|C|Eng|Outstanding.
119:03:41|T|CDR|Ought to shake the vehicle when it hits the bottom, Charlie.
119:03:43|T|LMP|I saw it.
119:03:45|T|CDR|Okay.  Oh ho, boy!
119:03:51|T|LMP|Hey, John, hurry up!!
119:03:54|T|CDR|I'm hurrying.  Okay.
119:04:05|T|CDR|Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains.  Apollo 16 is gonna change your image.  I'm sure glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs.
119:04:25|T|LMP|Okay, Recorder's Off. Vox Sensitivity to Max, Utility Floods are Off. Side Panels are Off.  Here I come, babe!
119:04:34|T|CDR|Okay. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">Jett bag</a> is going under the engine bell. I don't see any - Oh, look at those beautiful rocks!
119:04:43|T|CDR|I don't see any particular - Well, we broke the probes off, going straight down. The probes are all standing straight up.
119:04:54|T|LMP|Okay, great.
119:04:55|T|CDR|Oh, is this ever neat, Charlie!
119:04:57|T|LMP|Okay, I'm out. Almost.
119:05:02|T|CDR|Well, don't come out until you see what we just passed over.
119:05:06|T|LMP|It was a big rock, I tell you.
119:05:09|T|CDR|No, it was a big hole.
119:05:10|T|LMP|A big hole, huh?
119:05:11|T|CDR|Yeah. You ain't going to believe this.
119:05:13|T|LMP|Okay. Close the hatch.
119:05:15|T|CDR|Okay.  &quot;LEC on the rail. Lower the ETB. Comment on surroundings.&quot;
119:05:23|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, how far do you want me to close the hatch?
119:05:29|C|Eng|Okay. Just pull it snug, Charlie.
119:05:32|T|LMP|How far do you want -  What'd he say?
119:05:36|T|CDR|Just pull it snug.
119:05:38|T|CDR|Okay, I'm gonna open the MESA here .
119:05:40|T|LMP|It is.
119:05:41|T|CDR|Ho, ho. Is this ever nice -
119:05:43|T|LMP|Hot dog!! Is this great!
119:05:46|C|Eng|Sounds great.
119:05:58|T|LMP|You can see the - This is easier than we - Okay, John. You can see in the shadows just great!
119:06:03|T|CDR|Yep.
119:06:05|T|LMP|Oh! Look at that landing. You almost got a big rock - about a 50-centimeter rock - with the right leg -  The left leg.
119:06:13|T|CDR|Charlie.
119:06:14|T|LMP|What? That was a slight miscalculation on the ETB .
119:06:22|T|CDR|Yeah.
119:06:24|T|LMP|Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!  Okay, Tony, we're making little footprints here about 1/2-inch deep; not kicking up really very much .
119:06:40|T|LMP|We're going to have to pull that MESA up, John; that's too low.
119:06:49|T|CDR|Yeah, I know it.
119:06:55|T|LMP|Let's do that -
119:06:57|T|CDR|Okay; let me get these blankets down.
119:06:59|T|LMP|Okay.
119:07:06|T|CDR|Ah, is this ever superb! I'll pick it up.
119:07:12|T|LMP|Okay.
119:07:17|T|CDR|How high do you want it? Right about here?
119:07:21|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
119:07:23|T|CDR|You got to loosen this here thing.
119:07:25|T|LMP|I know it.
119:07:40|T|CDR|Wait a minute, Charlie, let me get it.
119:07:42|T|LMP|Okay.  Boy, the view of Stone Mountain, Tony, is superb.  Good Lord! Look at that hole we almost landed in!
119:08:01|C|Eng|The MESA blanket, John, that you usually fold up and put away there, we'd like you to put it over the TV until we use the TV.
119:08:14|T|CDR|Rog.
119:08:16|T|LMP|Getting that thing, John? Doesn't it come off, straight up? Looks like to me it comes up.
119:08:28|T|CDR|Houston, how do you get this MESA blanket thing up?
119:08:31|T|LMP|Tony, we need to jack the MESA up and we can't get the lock off.  The MESA is touching the ground. The old low case.
119:08:49|C|Eng|You should be able to just pull up on it there.
119:08:56|T|CDR|That's what I thought.
119:08:59|T|LMP|Is it taking in?
119:09:00|T|CDR|Uh-uh.
119:09:01|T|LMP|Hey, you want me to pull up on the black - the black stripe, don't you? The black?
119:09:07|T|CDR|Wait a minute, Charlie, take up on the MESA and let me pull this cord.
119:09:10|T|LMP|I just did that, John.
119:09:12|T|CDR|You're not - You're not pulling back, you're pulling - Charlie, pull down that way. Tighten up the cord. Pull down.
119:09:20|T|LMP|Right here?
119:09:21|T|CDR|No, right - Just pull in a straight line.
119:09:24|T|LMP|Okay.
119:09:25|T|CDR|See what I'm talking about?
119:09:27|T|LMP|Yeah.
119:09:28|T|CDR|Don't fall down, now.
119:09:36|T|LMP|Looks like it's hung up on the side here.
119:09:39|T|CDR|It's not working.
119:09:43|T|LMP|-
119:09:44|T|CDR|Well, the heck with it. Let's go on.
119:09:46|T|LMP|Wait a minute.  Well, I can't get it.
119:10:03|T|CDR|You want to move out of the way and let me see?
119:10:05|T|LMP|Yeah. Tony, don't you just pull straight up on the black line?
119:10:22|C|Eng|We're checking on that, Charlie.
119:10:34|T|CDR|There's some block you have to release, Charlie.
119:10:37|T|LMP|I think so, too.
119:10:47|T|LMP|John, let's see if we can do it with this. Why don't you see if you can pick it up.
119:10:54|T|CDR|Look at that red line on there, that's where it was supposed to be at.  Okay; I'll pick up the MESA. Okay?
119:11:04|T|LMP|Okay, let me see if I can get this thing. Here. We need to take - Okay, I got it. Why don't you - No, I've got it. Why don't you see if you can pull that gray line up. There you go. Keep going.
119:11:28|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Keep lifting.
119:11:30|T|LMP|Okay.
119:11:31|T|CDR|Is that enough?
119:11:32|T|LMP|Keep going.  - ; that's great.
119:11:34|T|CDR|Okay.
119:11:35|T|LMP|We got it.  Okay, we got it, Tony.
119:11:38|C|Eng|Outstanding.
119:11:47|T|CDR|Okay,  &quot;Blanket. Adjust the height. MESA blanket and TV tripod, unstow and deploy.&quot; Okay, we'll put the white blanket over there for such times as we use it.   off-load the LRV, Charlie Well, we've gotta get our <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj">PLSS antennas</a> up.
119:12:08|T|LMP|Okay, here -
119:12:09|T|CDR|Don't need that .
119:12:11|T|LMP|Well, I've got to get it out of the way -
119:12:13|T|CDR|Okay.
119:12:14|T|LMP|- to get this other stuff. See.
119:12:27|T|LMP|Okay, I'll put your antenna up.
119:12:29|T|CDR|Okay.
119:12:43|T|LMP|Partially out.
119:12:45|T|CDR|Okay.
119:12:46|C|Eng|And we'd like an EMU check from both of you.
119:12:54|T|LMP|Okay, I got clear flags, 94 percent; and 3.8; Min in cooling.
119:13:01|T|CDR|I got clear flags -
119:13:19|T|LMP|Well, Houston, here we are. Sleepy little Descartes. Boy, the old Cayley Plains are really something. Tell you, there are rocks all over the place, as we described.
119:13:33|T|CDR|At least 92 percent.
119:13:34|T|LMP|Hey, John, come on.
119:13:35|T|CDR|Eighty-five.
119:13:36|T|LMP|Come get my antenna.
119:13:37|T|CDR|Okay.
119:13:38|C|Eng|Okay; you were doubling; we didn't get the CDR's EMU.
119:13:46|T|LMP|Ninety-five percent.
119:13:48|T|CDR|Did you see it, Charlie?
119:13:51|T|LMP|Yeah, I saw it.
119:13:59|T|CDR|It 's up, Charlie.
119:14:00|T|LMP|Huh?
119:14:02|T|CDR|It is up.
119:14:03|T|LMP|Okay; thanks.  I'm going to get the drill out.  Man, I never saw that big hole back there.
119:14:13|T|CDR|Yeah, that's what I was telling you about.
119:14:15|T|LMP|Yeah. Tony, right behind the LM here, within 3 meters of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Z</a> footpad there's a hole - a crater - that's probably 10 meters deep. Five meters maybe, but 30 degrees angles on the side. Okay, the drill is out and it runs.
119:15:03|T|CDR|Okay. Charlie, I'm gonna off-load the LRV, I guess .
119:15:05|T|LMP|Okay, you be inspecting it.  And all four stems are out .
119:15:21|C|Eng|Okay.
119:15:30|T|LMP|Tony, if I get 40 feet back to do the pan from the SEQ Bay here , I'm going to fall in that big hole.  Okay, &quot;ETB to table&quot;.
119:16:03|T|CDR|Okay, the aft chassis are all parallel. The - are not pre-released.  releasing the thermal blanket. The walking hinges are locked. Heh, heh;  how about that? And the one toward the -
119:16:26|T|LMP|Okay; Tony, the paint on this side also, below the steerable antenna, is peeled off just like on the other side. I don't see anything wrong with that steerable, I guess it just won't work.
119:16:43|C|Eng|Okay.
119:16:44|T|CDR|Had to reset both sets of -
119:16:48|C|Eng|Charlie -
119:16:48|T|CDR|- walking hinges -
119:16:49|C|Eng|- we'll have some pictures for you to take of the steerable later, but we'll get that when you take your pan.
119:16:56|T|LMP|Yeah, I was planning on that. Okay, John. Had the walking hinges fixed, huh?
119:17:05|T|CDR|Yeah, had to fix both sets.
119:17:06|T|LMP|Okay, I'll help you on this other side.
119:17:09|T|LMP|Man, what a beautiful landing. I'm glad you weren't 10 feet - Whew me!
119:17:14|T|CDR|We were going forward.
119:17:16|T|LMP|Yeah, we were landing going forward.
119:17:20|T|CDR|That was what was worrying me.
119:17:23|T|LMP|Okay; here's your strap over here, John.
119:18:00|C|Eng|Okay.
119:18:01|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, here we go .
119:18:03|T|CDR|Wait a minute.
119:18:04|T|LMP|Okay.  I'm going up the porch, Tony, to get the Rover.  What a pretty machine.
119:18:24|T|CDR|I'll just run over here and grab this string, Charlie, and pull on it a little. Okay, on your string up there, there's tension on it, right?
119:18:43|T|LMP|Yeah.
119:18:44|T|CDR|Okay, let's just make sure that I've checked all these things.
119:18:46|T|LMP|Okay.
119:18:47|T|CDR|&quot;Unstow left side deployment. Reel OPS tape, drape over struts. Contingency tool to LM strut.&quot;  &quot;Walking hinge latches engaged.&quot;  just verify those one more time. &quot; - aft chassis parallel to center chas. Left and right outrigger cables taut.&quot; Verify your outrigger cables taut up there -
119:19:03|T|LMP|Yup; two. Both of them.
119:19:04|T|CDR|Okay. &quot;Want to reel out the tape, right side, and back away from the deploy area.&quot; Okay, Charlie.
119:19:12|T|LMP|Ready?
119:19:14|T|CDR|Yeah.
119:19:15|T|LMP|Okay, here we come.
119:19:18|T|CDR|It released.
119:19:18|T|LMP|We're loose. It released, Houston.
119:19:20|T|CDR|The bottom pins released, too. Both sets of them.
119:19:32|C|Eng|Very good.
119:19:34|T|CDR|Get Charlie down the steps.
119:19:36|T|LMP|Bouncing merrily. Man, it's great.
119:19:38|T|CDR|Isn't that neat?!
119:19:39|T|LMP|Oh!
119:19:40|T|CDR|That has got to be nice.
119:19:45|T|LMP|Believe it or not, this is like in the training building! The only thing we don't have, Tony, is the linoleum on the floors.
119:19:52|T|CDR|Grab a surface here, Charlie.
119:19:56|C|Eng|We'll try to fix that, Charlie.
119:20:58|T|LMP|wait a minute. I got to -
119:20:00|T|CDR|Pulling?
119:20:01|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm pulling.
119:20:02|T|CDR|Okay.  Oh! This is much easier than it was before ! Don't pull so hard, I guess.
119:20:18|T|LMP|Can't believe that big hole back there. John, you picked up the exact bottom of this old crater!!
119:20:25|T|CDR|Well, there weren't any flat places around here, Charlie.
119:20:29|T|LMP|Yeah, but anywhere else we would have landed, we would have been on a great big slope!
119:20:34|T|CDR|Okay, there goes the front wheels. And the aft chassis is released too, I think.
119:20:39|C|Eng|Very good.
119:20:40|T|LMP|The wheels didn't lock into place, John. We'll have to go up there and get the - and push them up.
119:20:44|T|CDR|Okay.
119:20:45|T|LMP|Okay, you hold that and let me run up and do that.
119:20:48|T|LMP|Okay.
119:20:52|T|CDR|The wheels didn't lock, Houston.
119:20:54|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that.
119:20:57|T|CDR|There goes one. Charlie got one. Is it in, Charlie?
119:21:05|T|LMP|Yeah, it is.
119:21:08|T|CDR|Okay. And the hinge pin - This hinge pin isn't in either.
119:21:13|T|LMP|We'll get that .
119:21:14|T|CDR|Okay, see if the other one is in. See if you can't get it.
119:21:21|T|LMP|Okay; stop pull.  John, I went just out of minimum on my cooling unit, and it feels a lot better.
119:21:30|T|CDR|Okay; I'll try that in a second here.
119:21:33|T|LMP|Okay; did it get in the walking hinges?
119:21:36|T|CDR|No, I don't think so, Charlie.
119:21:40|T|LMP|Okay, you see what it did. It didn't look like to me it did.
119:21:44|T|CDR|It didn't get in there.  Yeah. Yeah, it's sitting -  Yeah, it's sitting in something there, Charlie.
119:21:57|T|LMP|Okay, they're in.
119:21:00|T|CDR|Yeah. It looks to me that -
119:22:02|T|LMP|Wait a minute. This one is not in over here.
119:22:05|T|CDR|Are you sure?
119:22:06|T|LMP|Yep.
119:22:08|T|CDR|You just took it out of this one over here.
119:22:12|T|LMP|Okay; now, this one's in.
119:22:15|T|CDR|But just don't run off with it, Charlie.
119:22:16|T|LMP|I'm not. Okay; this one's in.
119:22:17|T|CDR|Okay, this one's in.
119:22:23|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, keep going.
119:22:30|T|CDR|Don't you want to pull some?
119:22:34|T|LMP|No, it says &quot;Release pull at aft-chassis unlock&quot;; and that's what I did.
119:22:35|T|CDR|Okay, it just stepped out of those walking hinges.
119:22:38|T|LMP|I know, and it's bouncing on us.  Those walking hinges are no longer any good anyway, after we get down to this point.
119:22:46|T|CDR|Okay, now it's sitting in them.
119:22:48|T|LMP|Okay.
119:22:49|T|CDR|Comes bouncing out.
119:22:50|T|LMP|Yeah; keep pulling. Watch that big rock there.
119:22:53|T|CDR|Oh, I see what you mean!
119:22:54|T|LMP|About a 50-centimeter boulder right next to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> footpad. Angular .
119:23:03|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie; do you want me to keep pulling?
119:23:05|T|LMP|Yeah, keep pulling until you hit the gray - . Until we get the weight off of these things .
119:23:19|T|CDR|You got to pull it away, Charlie.
119:23:24|T|LMP|There she comes.
119:23:26|T|CDR|Got it.
119:23:27|T|LMP|I can pick that beauty up right off the ground with this little cable.
119:23:31|T|CDR|Shall I keep pulling?
119:23:32|T|LMP|Yeah. Until you get that - Okay, that's it, John.
119:23:37|T|CDR|All the cable is slack.
119:23:38|T|LMP|Yeah, okay; that's great.
119:23:39|T|CDR|Let's go get it.
119:23:40|T|LMP|Okay, here; you need this.
119:23:41|T|CDR|Wait a minute, that rear wheel isn't locked.
119:23:44|T|LMP|Oh, we'll get that. Okay, you lock that side. I'll pull these pins.  Okay, this one's not locked out, either.  Okay, now it is. This hinge pin is in.
119:24:04|T|CDR|And this hinge pin is in. I think this is locked. Ohhh.
119:24:10|T|LMP|Watch out!
119:24:12|T|CDR|turn the car over.
119:24:13|T|LMP|I know it.
119:24:16|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, let me come back up here and help you.
119:24:23|T|LMP|Oh, boy, that cooling is so much nicer. Okay, here we go.
119:24:30|T|CDR|Hey, wait a minute, let me get a little further away from it in case it springs off the -
119:24:41|T|CDR|Yeah, I already picked up a rock to see if it was possible.
119:24:43|T|LMP|Yeah, I saw you.
119:24:46|T|CDR|Piece of cake. Although you got to maintain your c.g. .
119:24:49|C|Eng|Okay.
119:24:54|T|LMP|Tony, are you copying all this?
119:24:57|C|Eng|We sure are. We're all ears. Sure wish we had the TV.
119:25:05|T|LMP|Well, we'll get it for you in a minute. Sorry about that steerable, but - breaks. Okay, the Rover is within 2 feet of being on the ground!  Ah, the old machine!
119:25:22|T|CDR|I believe we're a little upslope here. I get the feeling if I let go of it, it'll roll under the vehicle .
119:25:29|T|LMP|Yeah, I do, too.  Okay, there we go, John. It's on the ground, Houston.
119:25:34|C|Eng|Okay.
119:25:35|T|CDR|Want us to pull out, Charlie?
119:25:36|T|LMP|Huh?  Just like in training, the checklist changes pages on you automatically.
119:25:45|T|CDR|Is that right?
119:25:50|T|CDR|Get that rear hinge off of there.
119:25:52|T|LMP|Wait a minute. I want to get this page turned; I want to make sure I got everything. Okay, &quot;Pull left pin, pull reel, pull saddle release.&quot; Okay. Here's the saddle release coming.
119:26:06|T|LM Crew|
119:26:08|T|LMP|Outstanding!
119:26:09|T|CDR|There you go! Let's pick this baby up and turn it around.
119:26:13|T|LMP|Okay.  Oh, look at that!!
119:26:17|T|CDR|Wait a minute, Charlie. Let me get these cables off the front of it. I forgot about them.
119:26:20|T|LMP|Okay.  You're all tangled up in that cord, John.
119:26:25|T|CDR|As usual.
119:26:26|T|LMP|Your right foot -  Your left foot.
119:26:28|T|CDR|Yeah. Hold what you've got.
119:26:32|T|LMP|Okay. There it is; it's off.
119:26:40|T|LMP|Watch that pin there.
119:26:48|T|CDR|-
119:26:51|T|LMP|Pick her up. Here we go.  We are upslope.
119:26:59|T|CDR|Yeah.
119:27:00|T|LMP|Just a skosh.
119:27:01|T|CDR|Doesn't amount to a hill of beans.
119:27:03|T|LMP|That's good. Hey, let's get around so you won't be looking in the Sun, John.
119:27:06|T|CDR|No, I'm not looking into the Sun.
119:27:08|T|LMP|You're gonna be, sitting in the seat!
119:27:10|T|CDR|Sharp thinking, Charlie.
119:27:15|T|LMP|Okay.  There you go.
119:27:17|T|CDR|You're going to have a little tricky footing with that ALSEP .  Okay, old &quot;geology pallet post, release&quot;.
119:27:30|T|CDR|You got to get the contingency tool to push these two pins in.
119:27:33|T|LMP|Okay, I'll get it.
119:27:46|T|CDR|That old U.S. flag there on them fenders. Looks good.
119:27:52|T|LMP|an experience like this.
119:27:59|C|Eng|I agree with you, Charlie.
119:28:02|T|LMP|This one's in, here.
119:28:04|T|CDR|Yeah, but it's out over here. Sock it to me. Don't push it in, if it's already in.
119:28:10|T|LMP|No, I just was checking -
119:28:12|T|CDR|No, come on. Give me that. We don't need to do that.  Careful.
119:28:27|C|Eng|Understand all the hinge pins are in?
119:28:33|T|CDR|We're getting them in.  I think yours is out. I think there's one out on your side a little.
119:28:44|T|LMP|No, it's in.
119:28:46|T|CDR|In?
119:28:47|T|LMP|Yeah.
119:28:50|T|CDR|Okay. Both in on my side.
119:28:51|T|LMP|Okay, I'm gonna get the seat .
119:28:58|T|LM Crew|-
119:29:08|T|CDR|That holds the seat down. Me and Charlie just picked the vehicle up.  Ho ho.
119:29:16|C|Eng|You just don't know your own strength.
119:29:24|T|CDR|The people that put Velcro in don't know its strength, that's the message, Tony.
119:29:56|T|LMP|This thing - Going a million miles, John.
119:30:02|T|CDR|Look at that.
119:30:04|T|LMP|Here's your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="alsj">seatbelt</a>.
119:30:06|T|CDR|Okay. Seatbelt is up, locked.
119:30:09|T|LMP|Hey, can you take it over there and drape it over so you won't get all tangled up with two seatbelts?
119:30:15|T|CDR|Take the other one, too?
119:30:16|T|LMP|No, this is yours.
119:30:19|T|CDR|I'll be darned. . Don't want to even think about that.
119:30:25|T|LMP|Okay, next is the console.
119:30:27|T|CDR|Okay, let's get it.
119:30:39|T|LMP|Okay.
119:30:40|T|CDR|Wait a second, Charlie, I -
119:30:42|T|LMP|Okay, mine is out; rotate it 90 .
119:30:50|T|CDR|Okay, rotate 90.
119:30:54|T|LMP|Okay.
119:30:55|T|CDR|Beautiful.
119:30:57|T|LMP|In and locked.
119:30:59|T|CDR|Locked.
119:31:02|T|LMP|Okay, those are coming out.
119:31:08|T|CDR|Okay, we're removing the pins from this critter.
119:31:23|T|LMP|John, what's that black thing over there?
119:31:27|T|CDR|Over where, Charlie?
119:31:28|T|LMP|Right in front of my seat. That little black thing.
119:31:31|T|CDR|In front of your seat? That jobber there?
119:31:35|T|LMP|Yeah. No, right in front of - Under your -  Doesn't matter; but I was just wondering what it was.
119:31:49|T|CDR|It was a little black thing.
119:31:51|T|LMP|It is a little black thing, - .
119:31:55|T|CDR|Houston, we just found one of those little black things.
119:32:00|T|LMP|A little black disk. It looked like it's probably a bumper guard. Something from the stowage area, Tony. But it's no consequence.  Man, can you sling things a long way. Look at that. Went into that crater.  Too bad there isn't something to lean on. I have a tough time bending in this suit.
119:32:39|T|CDR|Okay.
119:32:40|T|LMP|fender's out.
119:32:43|T|CDR|Okay.
119:32:44|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;C&amp;W , drape seat belts, tripod, tool, erect footrest, verify front hinge pins, extend front fender.&quot; Okay. Okay, I'm going to get the camera .
119:32:54|T|CDR|All righty.
119:32:55|T|LMP|the pans.
119:32:57|T|LMP|Ya-hoo! Tony, this is so great you can't believe it!
119:33:01|C|Eng|Oh, I believe it, Charlie.  When you get in the middle of your pictures there, you might give me a call and I'll instruct you on some more we'd like.
119:33:18|T|LMP|Okay.
119:33:20|T|CDR|The LRV checkout .
119:33:42|T|CDR|Okay, brake on.
119:33:46|T|CDR|Reverse off.
119:33:47|T|LMP|I'm starting with mag Alpha at frame count 39.
119:33:52|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm starting the LRV checkout.
119:33:54|C|Eng|Okay. And, Charlie, 39.
119:34:02|T|CDR|Circuit breakers all going closed except Aux and Nav.  My personal impression is I'm sitting up higher in this seat right now than I did in that one-sixth-g rig that we made, if you can believe such a thing.
119:34:27|C|Eng|Understand.
119:34:32|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm gonna be about 60 - 30 - make it 20 meters behind between the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> and the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Z</a> . If I get right at the SEQ Bay, I'm in that big hole.
119:34:57|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine.
119:34:58|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The Amp-Hour on number 1 say 125, and the Amp-Hours on number 2 are off-scale low, and the Volts on number 1 are 85 and the Volts on number 2 are off-scale low.
119:35:23|T|LMP|we haven't lost that battery.
119:35:26|T|CDR|Well, it ain't reading, if we haven't. Maybe we lost the - Of course, the Forward and Rear Motor temperatures are off-scale low and -
119:35:46|T|CDR|And the Battery Temperatures are off-scale low.
119:35:53|C|Eng|Okay, and we'd like you to take pictures of the ablated paint, Charlie.
119:36:00|T|LMP|Okay, I'll do that. I'll do it at f/8, at about 15 feet.
119:36:11|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like f/8 at 250 and f/11 at 250 of all of the ablated surfaces.
119:36:28|C|Eng|Okay.
119:36:34|T|LMP|Tony, you can see the striations caused by the descent plume. It 's running, John!
119:36:42|T|CDR|Look at it go, would you, Charlie!
119:36:44|T|LMP|You've got all your steering. It's great!
119:36:47|T|CDR|Ah, this is going to be some kind of different ride!
119:37:02|T|LMP|The Rover is running, Houston.
119:37:05|C|Eng|Okay, and when you're over at the S-band, we have a couple of more pictures of that one.
119:37:11|T|LMP|I just got it, Tony.
119:37:14|C|Eng|Okay, there's a particular surface on it we're interested in.
119:37:21|T|LMP|Stand by. Okay, just a minute.
119:37:26|T|CDR|Let me try it through a few of these little craters here, Charlie. You know, it's hard to get to where you are from here.
119:37:39|T|LMP|there were only two, and it's the two above the ascent tank.  John, you were coming absolutely straight down when you hit. Okay, Tony, go ahead with the S-band.
119:37:54|C|Eng|Okay, we want you to take a picture of the white side of the yoke. The yoke has a black side and a white side.  And on the white side, we want at 1/250th, f/5.6, f/8, and f/11.
119:38:13|T|LMP|Okay, I've got the f/8 and f/11. I'll do the 5.6 one.
119:38:17|C|Eng|Good show.
119:38:21|T|LMP|John, you're sure going slow.
119:38:23|T|CDR|Yeah, the wheels are skidding, Charlie.
119:38:25|T|LMP|Okay, your rear steering's off.
119:38:27|T|CDR|Huh?
119:38:28|T|LMP|You don't have any rear steering.
119:38:30|T|CDR|Is that what the problem is?
119:38:32|T|CDR|I thought you said both steerings was working?
119:38:33|T|LMP|It looked it to me, but it's not now.
119:38:36|T|CDR|You know why it's not working?
119:38:37|T|LMP|We don't have a battery.
119:38:39|T|CDR|Huh?
119:38:42|T|LMP|Huh?  Shift it to the other battery.
119:38:50|T|CDR|How's it doing now?
119:38:53|T|LMP|Nope. Front's working, but the rear's not.
119:38:58|T|CDR|Well, I just checked Bus B and Bus D. We don't - Okay, let me go to primary.  That make any difference?
119:39:08|T|LMP|Nope. Rear steering's not working.
119:39:10|T|CDR|Okay. I'm gonna park it anyway. We can't trouble-shoot it now.
119:39:14|T|LMP|Okay, could you - That's good; that's a good position. Okay, Tony. The rear steering is not working.
119:39:20|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
119:39:33|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the pan is complete. The LM just looks super. It's in perfect shape. No problem. The soil around here is very fine grained. Dusty, much like all the regolith that we've seen samples of from the other sites. The rocks are scattered. Perhaps 20 or 30 percent of the surface is covered by boulders up to 25 centimeters. Small craters pock mark the whole place; meter to 2-meter size, covering perhaps 70 percent of the surface.
119:40:28|T|CDR|Don't ask me to check if the rear coupling's been pulled. Don't ask me to do that. Oh.  That pin is still taped down for the rear steering .
119:40:48|T|CDR|Okay. &quot;Off-load and deploy the far UV&quot; .
119:41:01|T|CDR|You can definitely see where we kicked up some dirt. Did you explain all these patterns to them, Charlie?
119:41:07|T|LMP|Yeah. You might give a word.
119:41:27|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. Looking at Stone Mountain. You see some lineations in it that are parallel to the local terrain - or to the normal surface - and they follow the contour lines. And it looks to me it might be just some small ridges in it. They're scattered about -  I say they're &quot;scattered about&quot;, that 's not any good at all. They look like a couple of meters wide or so, and the same distance -
119:42:05|T|CDR|
119:42:06|T|LMP|- and separation. What is it, John?
119:42:13|T|CDR|Pulled the top out of the MESA blanket.
119:42:15|T|LMP|Oh.
119:42:17|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm about to deploy the old UV here.
119:42:31|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, I'm going back to midway between Intermediate and Minimum. I was in Minimum when I was driving the old Rover, and it seemed to be pretty good.
119:42:45|T|LMP|Look at that LCRU come out of here! Hah!  No struggle.  Now, I can't bend the suit.
119:44:01|T|CDR|Oh, oh, oh, oh. Look at that, Charlie!!
119:44:10|T|LMP|You got it!
119:44:11|T|CDR|Look at me carry it! I'm carrying it over my shoulder!!! Ha ha ha! I guess we don't have to worry about dust getting on it. Boy, one-sixth g is the neatest environment you can find for this kind of work.
119:44:43|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I'm gonna put it over here by the strut, just like it shows on my picture there. Maybe right even with bottom strut.
119:45:00|T|LMP|Okay.
119:45:01|T|CDR|We'll just have to watch where we throw things.  Ohh! Ohh! Ohh, is that nice!
119:46:04|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. All three wheels are down and locked on the camera.
119:46:14|C|Eng|Okay.
119:46:19|T|CDR|Charlie?
119:46:20|T|LMP|What?
119:46:21|T|CDR|Do you know where I'm gonna have to put this contraption?
119:46:23|T|LMP|Where?
119:46:24|T|CDR|Right here. According to my picture.
119:46:33|T|CDR|Okay, now, Tony, if I set it parallel to the shadow, is that due west?
119:46:36|C|Eng|That's close enough to due west. It'll be about 3 degrees off.
119:46:43|T|CDR|Well, I can set it 3 degrees some way or another.
119:46:47|C|Eng|Okay, bias it north slightly.
119:47:04|T|LMP|Well, Tony, I tell you one thing, that's the hardest job on there, getting that crummy connector on there. Whew.  Okay.
119:47:36|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, the battery temperature is reading 100 degrees F, which it was reading before - That's the one the other one always reads.
119:47:45|C|Eng|Okay, that sounds good.
119:47:47|T|CDR|And I'm setting the battery out. The battery is going out in the Sun with the temperature plate up. No, it's down.  Now it's up.  Too far.
119:48:39|C|Eng|And, John, when you get to the first setting, I've some new settings for you.
119:48:46|T|CDR|I thought you might have, Tony.
119:48:48|T|CDR|Okay.  &quot;Deploy legs, point camera down-Sun, embed, stabilize, remove battery pins, azimuth pin.&quot; Okay. &quot;Plate pin.&quot; Okay.
119:49:20|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, now that we got this little beauty pressurized, the suit just feels perfect.
119:49:27|C|Eng|Good show.
119:49:29|T|CDR|Pull the -
119:49:30|C|Eng|Shall we give credits to the tailor?
119:49:35|T|CDR|- plate pin.
119:49:41|T|LMP|I'll give credit to Clyde and Troy and those guys and everybody who helped me get it fitted right.
119:49:47|C|Eng|Right.
119:49:59|T|CDR|Well, your magnet still works, Houston.
119:50:03|C|Eng|Now we got a data point; magnets work on the Moon.
119:50:15|T|LMP|Okay, where we are : the low gain antenna is coming in on my checklist, Tony.
119:50:22|T|CDR|Charlie, I forgot to put in the Aux circuit breakers over there . Push it in.
119:50:26|T|LMP|Aux circuit breaker going in.
119:50:28|T|CDR|Okay. That'll save us some trouble.
119:50:36|T|LMP|I really can't believe you got that UV up so easy.  -
119:50:40|T|CDR|Isn't that nice?
119:50:42|T|LMP|I was really worried about that one, babe.
119:50:49|T|CDR|Okay, the camera points down-Sun . Protective cover.  -
119:51:13|T|LMP|Ahhhh! Just like in the training building!
119:51:19|C|Eng|Aw, come on. I doubt that. That's got to be better -
119:51:20|T|LMP|Tony, you look away - In fact, you look anywhere but -  Well, I mean the gear's working exactly like we - And I'll tell you, those guys - Covington and all of them and Jerry Stoner and Bob Kain and that group are all - Roger Copa - they were all slave drivers, but it's really paying off, I'll tell you.  The low-gain is connected to the - I should have say the &quot;ankle bone&quot; but it ain't, it's the LCRU .  Okay, &quot;install TCU; unstow rake; connect low gain; install high gain.&quot; That's what I thought.
119:52:35|T|LMP|Ha! This is so easy!  This - .
119:53:18|T|LMP|Okay, the low-gain -  high-gain is installed.
119:53:34|T|LMP|Okay, John, here comes the picture. Ah-ha-ha! Man, Tony, I locked it the first time.
119:53:44|C|Eng|Outstanding. That's got to be a first.
119:53:49|T|LMP|It is for me.
119:54:01|T|CDR|Okay, the old bubble person has got the bubble right in the middle.
119:54:05|C|Eng|Okay.
119:54:10|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;set target number one&quot;. Azimuth 14 and elevation 48, and say again what you want me to make it, Tony.
119:54:16|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like to make the azimuth 98.
119:54:26|T|CDR|98?!
119:54:28|C|Eng|Right, we're changing targets.
119:54:29|T|CDR|That ain't even close.  Yeah.  Okay.
119:54:37|C|Eng|And the elevation is 28.  And watch the film advance as you turn the power on.
119:55:00|T|CDR|And turning it in azimuth just completely destroyed whatever level it had. 98 and what now?
119:55:10|C|Eng|98 and 28.
119:55:26|T|CDR|98 and 28. Okay.
119:55:35|T|LMP|Well, Tony, the old Earth is boresighted in the sight.
119:55:39|C|Eng|Outstanding.
119:55:45|T|LMP|Gonna be right on, babe. I think. Oops. Hey, you really got to bend back to see that beauty . Y'all are right overhead! Okay, TV.
119:56:34|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I turned the power switch on -  When I unstowed it, the power switch was on. I turned the power switch off on the TV.
119:56:41|C|Eng|Okay.
119:56:51|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, will you go with this bubble just broke off on one side, or do you want to level it every time?
119:56:59|C|Eng|Is it off the case ?
119:57:03|T|CDR|Yeah, it's off the case.
119:57:04|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine. As long as it's off the case.
119:57:11|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay. Now, all you want me to do on this first one is turn the power switch on, right?
119:57:43|C|Eng|Right. Power switch on, and watch the film advance as you come on so you can tell us how many degrees.
119:57:52|T|CDR|Okay, it looked like it was better than 90. That's about all I can say about it. Maybe 100 or 110.
119:57:58|C|Eng|Okay.  Let's just leave it there.
119:58:11|T|LMP|Is that what that is?
119:58:12|T|CDR|Yeah.
119:58:13|T|LMP|Ah, so. I can hear it, John.
119:58:26|T|CDR|Yep.   Okay, I guess that tells us something about the camera operation.
119:58:29|C|Eng|Right, the mode change works.
119:58:30|T|CDR|It started, I'm sure, Houston.  Yep. Well, I don't know. That'll probably be in a minute or two - like two and a quarter minutes. Okay. I'm gonna -
119:58:48|T|CDR|Boy, is this ever a neat operating environment!
119:59:17|T|LMP|-   Okay, Tony, I'm reading, on Internal, S-band is 26, Temp is 14, Power is 22. Over.
119:59:40|T|CDR|Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
119:59:41|C|Eng|Okay, we copy.
119:59:42|T|CDR|Look at this, Charlie.
119:59:43|T|LMP|Yeah.
119:59:46|T|CDR|I can carry it over my head.
119:59:58|T|CDR|He gets paid double time, Charlie.
120:00:00|T|LMP|I'll tell you.
120:00:01|T|CDR|For every strip.
120:00:05|T|LMP|It's amazing.   the LCRU blankets are 100 percent open.
120:00:17|C|Eng|Okay.
120:00:19|T|LMP|Going to External.  Mode switch to 2.
120:00:37|T|CDR|I'll be darn if the old <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16lsp194.gif" title="image" target="alsj">Quad III</a> pallet didn't go on like it was supposed to!
120:00:43|T|LMP|And, Tony, you ought to have it; you got 4.0 on the signal strength.
120:00:47|T|CDR|Lookit that!  -
120:01:06|T|LMP|You getting a signal, Tony?
120:01:08|C|Eng|Ah, we're working it.
120:01:12|T|LMP|Okay, you got 4.0; you got External, and your mode switch is 2, and the Power is 2 - correction - I didn't check the power.  The S-Band -  The Power is 12. 14. Over. Correction, make that 18.
120:01:38|T|CDR|Oh, don't tell me.
120:01:40|T|LMP|What?
120:01:44|T|CDR|Finally happened.
120:01:46|T|LMP|What?
120:01:47|T|CDR|I pulled a wire loose, Charlie.
120:01:48|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
120:02:10|T|CDR|Okay,
120:02:41|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read?
120:02:45|C|Eng|Stand by a second, Charlie.  Okay, it's looking pretty good. Don't have a picture here in the room yet, but we're getting data.
120:02:54|T|LMP|Okay, fine. Okay.  the DAC is coming out .
120:03:07|T|CDR|- as far as keeping an eye on us, you guys would rather be outside than inside, wouldn't you?
120:03:13|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the TV camera is pointed right down at the ground, forward of the Rover.
120:03:21|C|Eng|Hey, our comm just improved 900 percent. That's beautiful.
120:03:46|T|CDR|Uh-oh, look at that.
120:03:49|T|LMP|Did you get that pin out, John?
120:03:51|T|CDR|Which one, Charlie?
120:03:52|T|LMP|The one that you broke the wire on.
120:03:54|T|CDR|No, I haven't, but I'll work it later.
120:03:57|T|LMP|What is it to?
120:03:59|T|CDR|I don't know. Wait a minute.  Think it's to the penetrometer.
120:04:21|T|LMP|Man, I tell you, if my Christmas stocking looked like this ETB, I'd be saved. Okay, magazine P, the X is in the middle, and the frame is lined up.
120:04:36|C|Eng|Okay, magazine Papa.  Hey, Charlie. Verify the TV power switch is on.
120:04:48|T|CDR|all right.
120:04:54|T|LMP|Stand by.
120:05:01|T|CDR|Got it, Charlie.
120:05:06|T|LMP|You mean the LM power switch or the one on the TCU?
120:05:10|C|Eng|On the TCU.
120:05:14|T|LMP|Okay, I'll shoot it to On. Okay, momentary On; back to center.
120:05:23|C|Eng|Okay.  Hey, we've got a picture!!
120:05:38|T|LMP|Yea!
120:05:40|C|Eng|Of the ground.
120:05:41|T|LMP|Let's hear it .
120:05:44|T|CDR|Yeah. That's nice looking ground.
120:05:48|T|LMP|Okay, the camera is running! The 16 millimeter is running!
120:05:52|C|Eng|Outstanding.
120:05:53|T|CDR|I don't believe it.
120:05:55|T|LMP|It's actually -
120:05:56|T|CDR|Outstanding.
120:06:00|T|LMP|Okay, getting the other DAC out .
120:06:06|C|Eng|This mission's full of firsts.
120:06:13|T|LMP|Little firsts, but they mean something -
120:06:18|T|CDR|Oh, is this easy to do in one-sixth gravity - .
120:06:20|T|LMP|- personally, anyway.
120:06:23|T|CDR|- I really like it. This is about the neatest thing I ever saw. Okay.
120:06:51|T|LMP|Hey, you're looking at me with the big eye!
120:06:53|C|Eng|Right. The big eye's on you, Charlie.
120:06:57|T|CDR|trying to see if you're nervous, Charlie.
120:07:10|T|LMP|Can't just throw those bags over there like I used to ; they bounce into the dirt.
120:07:14|T|CDR|Yeah.
120:07:19|T|LMP|How's the picture, Tony?
120:07:21|C|Eng|Very good picture.  Beautiful; outstanding color.
120:07:32|T|LMP|Super.
120:07:33|C|Eng|You're in living color.
120:07:35|T|LMP|Okay, I'm putting on magazine Bravo -  Okay, magazine Bravo is going on the Commander's camera.
120:07:53|C|Eng|Okay.
120:07:54|T|CDR|That won't work, Charlie.
120:07:55|C|Eng|Bravo 4; and keep count of how many times you blow off the dust.
120:07:56|T|LMP|It didn't get it off, John.  Well, it didn't work, so -
120:08:04|T|CDR|Oh, look, this thing says &quot;Lock&quot; on it, Charlie.
120:08:08|T|LMP|Okay, this goes to the other seat.
120:08:11|T|CDR|Charlie, that thing tells you what to do!
120:08:13|T|LMP|How about that?  A new first. This is so super.
120:08:08|T|CDR|Oh, boy!
120:08:09|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;three HEDC , two DAC , and 500 under the seat&quot;.
120:08:35|T|CDR|Got you, huh?
120:08:48|T|LMP|Uh-huh.  Oops.
120:09:13|T|CDR|I tell you, Houston. I'm just <i>cool</i> as a cucumber, and this Sun is so bright you can't believe it.
120:09:18|C|Eng|Outstanding.
120:09:36|T|LMP|Okay, as you can tell on the big eye, we're unloading the ETB under the Commander's seat.
120:09:49|T|CDR|Hey, your vise is in, Charlie, .
120:09:51|T|LMP|Super.  John, I don't know if this film is gonna really balance in here; I can't get it wedged in like I did .
120:10:00|T|CDR|No, I don't think - I don't think -  -
120:10:11|T|LMP|How do you read, John? You're cutting out.
120:10:13|T|CDR|Loud and clear, Charlie; I'm talking to myself.
120:10:16|T|LMP|Oh, okay.
120:10:37|T|CDR|By golly, we did it again.
120:10:39|T|LMP|What?
120:10:40|T|CDR|I would never've thought that on the Moon, we'd run into each other right here at the seat, but we did in practice every time.
120:10:46|T|LMP|Every time!
120:10:48|C|Eng|Well, you're consistent.
120:10:55|T|LMP|That's those timeline guys for you.
120:10:57|T|CDR|Do this EVA two or three more times, we may get it down.
120:11:02|T|LMP|Okay, the Sun compass goes under your seat, map's going over in mine.  And here comes the big eye, the 500.
120:11:17|T|CDR|Oh, that's a clean <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>, Houston, but I don't think it's gonna last.
120:11:32|T|CDR|You can tell that the dustbrush hangs in there pretty good pick up the front of the Rover to see if the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> is latched.
120:12:04|T|LMP|Okay.
120:12:13|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, where's the rake? There it is.
120:12:18|T|CDR|Oh, yes; the old doomaflicky's got it.
120:12:32|T|CDR|Look at that, Charlie.
120:12:56|T|CDR|Isn't that swell?! The rake is on and locked, Charlie.
120:13:01|T|LMP|Super. &quot;ETB back to the MESA&quot;.
120:13:11|T|LMP|Okay.
120:13:55|T|LMP|Sorry I blocked your picture there, Tony.
120:14:07|T|CDR|Old Fredo is to be congratulated for thinking of how to put this rake in.
120:14:12|T|LMP|Yeah, that's a new first.
120:14:14|T|CDR|Darn right. That's good stuff. Save us a lot of work later on.
120:14:31|T|CDR|Okay, that's about the size of it.
120:14:34|T|LMP|Ah, the old maps! Which old map do you want to look at, John? Hmm. Just like training. Good picture of Hadley Rille .  I'm just teasing, Houston.
120:14:50|T|CDR|Looks like we're down some, I guess, on the timeline already.
120:14:54|T|LMP|Are we? Tony, are we down?
120:14:58|C|Eng|No, you're right on the timeline.
120:14:59|T|CDR|Probably pretty even.
120:15:02|T|LMP|Okay. I thought we were moving along pretty good.
120:15:05|T|CDR|So did I.
120:15:08|C|Eng|You're doing just fine.
120:15:09|T|CDR|You got the ETB unstowed ?
120:15:13|T|LMP|Yeah, it's all done, John. Cameras are up.
120:15:21|T|LMP|I've got to get the pallet out.
120:15:23|T|CDR|
120:15:23|C|Eng|Hey, Charlie, don't pull that pallet out, we'll hold that for later.
120:15:29|T|LMP|Okay.
120:15:30|C|Eng|We'll get that at the end of the EVA.
120:15:34|T|LMP|Super!
120:15:37|C|Eng|And you can skip all the ingressing parts and go on after that.
120:15:46|T|LMP|Okay, the SRC's next. John, why don't you unpack the SRC . It's on the right side .
120:15:53|T|CDR|Okay, I'll get it.
120:15:55|T|LMP|And I'll get the core stems and stuff to my seat .
120:16:07|T|CDR|How come we can afford to skip that ? I disremember.
120:16:11|T|LMP|Oh, there's nothing -
120:16:13|T|CDR|There's nothing up there?
120:16:14|T|LMP|Well, the only reason we had to go in there was to change to power down, see.
120:16:18|T|CDR|Oh, okay. Right.
120:16:19|T|LMP|And we can get the other - The other stuff is just food and -
120:16:21|T|CDR|Okay. Yeah, all right. Fine.
120:16:22|T|LMP|- stuff like that.
120:16:24|T|CDR|Okay. I got you. I thought it was something on that order.  One small step for Charlie is one giant leap for me. I'm looking dead level with the table on the - .
120:16:44|T|LMP|Yeah, I did get it a little high!
120:16:46|T|CDR|Yeah, Charlie.
120:16:50|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. That &quot;Percy Precision&quot; Young, was coming right straight down when he hit. We didn't move an inch on those footpads.
120:17:04|C|Eng|Very good. Would you verify that you got the sunshield on the TV camera?
120:17:11|T|LMP|Not yet; we'll get it.
120:17:13|C|Eng|Okay.
120:17:15|T|LMP|That was gonna be part of the pallet stuff; I'll get it. I don't know whether John can reach it or not.
120:17:20|T|CDR|That was going to be part of taking it out to the table, but we just skipped that part.
120:17:23|T|LMP|Oh, that's right; yeah, we did.
120:17:29|T|LMP|Okay; I'm gonna close -
120:17:31|T|CDR|There goes that shield thing that came off.
120:17:34|T|LMP|What shield thing?
120:17:35|T|CDR|That thing down there.
120:17:37|T|LMP|That's okay.
120:17:41|T|CDR|-  Make it hard to close the box later on.
120:17:45|T|LMP|Guess what?
120:17:46|T|CDR|What, Charlie?
120:17:55|T|LMP|Look at me, John.
120:17:57|T|CDR|Yeah?
120:17:58|T|LMP|Look at that. I just pole-vaulted up into the MESA to get that beauty.
120:18:09|T|CDR|Charlie, what do I do with the SRC? You've got that piece of paper on you.
120:18:13|T|LMP|Okay, the SRC; it just says &quot;Seal control sample. SCB to left-hand tool carry.&quot;
120:18:24|T|LMP|Ahhh, I've got it, now.
120:18:27|T|CDR|Covered with dirt?
120:18:33|C|Eng|Okay; that's two.
120:18:47|C|Eng|Okay.
120:19:00|T|LMP|Okay. It looks pretty good to me.
120:19:02|C|Eng|Outstanding here.
120:19:04|T|LMP|It's on straight. How about you?  Okay.
120:19:11|T|CDR|Okay.
120:19:12|T|LMP|Okay, John.
120:19:14|T|CDR|table.
120:19:16|T|LMP|The box?
120:19:18|T|CDR|It's on there.
120:19:21|T|LMP|Got to keep those MESA blankets on this left side closed. The Sun's on that side of the MESA.
120:19:29|T|CDR|Hey, you gonna deploy that thing?
120:19:31|T|LMP|What thing?
120:19:32|T|CDR|That critter.
120:19:33|T|LMP|I'm gonna get the control sample here.
120:19:34|T|CDR|Okay, I'll get the flag .
120:19:35|T|LMP|Okay. And it works. You can spin it right up, John. Just like we started doing in training.
120:19:45|T|LMP|Okay, while you're getting the flag, I'll go open the ALSEP door.
120:19:49|T|CDR|Okay.
120:19:51|T|LMP|You know, another 10 feet back, and we'd have had a terrible time with that ALSEP.
120:19:57|T|CDR|That's why I was glad I could see the ground .
120:20:00|T|LMP|Yeah. Did you see that big thing coming down?
120:20:03|T|CDR|You bet ya.
120:20:04|T|LMP|Man, I sure didn't.
120:20:05|T|CDR|That's why we were moving forward there toward the last. A little. Or trying to.
120:20:28|T|LMP|Here we go. Yea! It came open! Ha ha!
120:20:34|T|CDR|What came open, Charlie?
120:20:35|T|LMP|The ALSEP doors.  Okay, your Descent switch is on, Houston. Descent ECA Temp Monitors. And we'll remove the experiments package.
120:20:53|C|Eng|Okay.
120:20:54|T|LMP|This ALSEP is <i>right</i> at eye level, Tony.
120:20:58|C|Eng|Very good.
120:20:59|T|LMP|Exactly eye level.
120:21:01|C|Eng|And, John, we'd like the LiOH can in the Sun.
120:21:07|T|LMP|Boy, that 's heavy.
120:21:10|C|Eng|Oh, correction -
120:21:11|T|CDR|Want the LiOH can in the Sun -
120:21:15|C|Eng|Negative. In the center of the MESA cavity. Sorry.
120:21:19|T|CDR|Yeah, I know that!
120:21:21|C|Eng|Okay.
120:21:22|T|CDR|Don't let me forget it.
120:21:23|C|Eng|Okay.
120:21:28|T|CDR|That was what I was supposed to do before we do this, huh?  you're telling me.
120:21:35|T|LMP|Stealing your thunder back here, John. I'm taking all the ALSEP stuff out.
120:21:49|T|CDR|Never seen it fail.
120:21:51|T|LMP|What happened?
120:21:52|T|CDR|-
120:22:23|T|LMP|Tony, I'm going out for the Olympics. I just slung that little carry bar on the ALSEP package - the crooked one - about 200 meters, it looked like. There goes the other one. I'm a real winner on the hammer throw. Look at that beauty go! Just created my own secondary . How are you doing with the flag, John?
120:22:55|C|Eng|Outstanding, Charlie. I'm sure you'll hold the record now.
120:23:04|T|LMP|I doubt that.  Maybe for the Cayley Plains Saturday afternoon shindig.
120:23:35|T|CDR|You really should set the flag up on a hill, Charlie, but there just ain't one .
120:23:40|T|LMP|I know, John.
120:23:43|T|CDR|I'll put it right here. Big rock.
120:23:50|T|LMP|Are you setting it up now?
120:23:51|T|CDR|Yeah.
120:23:52|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute; I'll run and come get the camera. Can't pass that up.
120:23:56|T|CDR|That's all right.  That's got it.
120:24:05|T|LMP|Wait a minute. You're not getting away from there without me getting your picture.
120:24:08|T|CDR|Charlie, we can get that in a minute, okay?
120:24:11|T|LMP|I got it. Here we go. Come on. You get that LiOH canister and I'll get the camera.
120:24:16|T|CDR|Okay. That's fair enough.
120:24:23|T|CDR|I know, I had to go - I've been on my knees twice to get things.  no way to avoid it. That's why I'm glad the pressure suit bends.
120:24:36|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're starting the LMP's camera for the flag.
120:24:41|T|CDR|Houston, I'll admit I forgot that the LiOH canister was supposed to be out and I missed that step, but I'm sure glad your first attempt to tell me to put it in the Sun was -
120:24:57|C|Eng|Yeah, that was my error, John.
120:24:59|T|CDR|- a baddie.
120:25:02|T|LMP|And, Tony, the Rover tracks are just - We're barely sinking in!
120:25:08|C|Eng|Yeah, we can see that.
120:25:09|T|CDR|You can't put it too far down in the middle of the -
120:25:15|C|Eng|Say again, John?
120:25:16|T|CDR|Okay, there it is. Okay, I got it in there now.
120:25:23|T|LMP|Hey, John, this is perfect, with the LM and the Rover and you and Stone Mountain. And the old flag. Come on out here and give me a salute. Big Navy salute.
120:25:40|C|Eng|That's a pretty outstanding picture here, I tell you.
120:25:54|T|CDR|-
120:26:08|T|LMP|Yes, sir; we do.
120:26:09|T|CDR|
120:26:10|T|LMP|And fly high and straight and land soft.
120:26:15|T|LMP|Here we go.
120:26:16|T|CDR|Do it again.
120:26:19|C|Eng|This looks like a good time for some good news here - .
120:26:20|T|CDR|Okay.
120:26:21|T|LMP|Got it?
120:26:21|C|Eng|- The House passed the space budget yesterday, 277 to 60, which includes the vote for the Shuttle.
120:26:30|T|LM Crew|Beautiful. Wonderful. Beautiful.
120:26:33|T|LMP|Tony, again I'll say it, with that salute, I'm proud to be an American, I'll tell you. What a program and what a place and what an experience.
120:26:42|T|CDR|And I'll say it too.
120:26:43|C|Eng|So am I.
120:26:44|T|CDR|The country needs that Shuttle mighty bad. You'll see.
120:26:49|T|LMP|I just want to say thank you -
120:26:50|T|CDR|What do you want to do with this camera, Charlie?
120:26:53|T|LMP|Put it on the left floor - Right seat, my seat. No, on your left - It's got to go under your seat. I'm sorry.
120:26:59|T|CDR|That's okay.
120:27:15|T|CDR|Okay, both cameras are going under my seat, Charlie, in case you look for them.
120:27:18|T|LMP|Okay, I don't need one.
120:27:28|T|CDR|Okay, the MESA blankets are all closed, Houston. Or getting that way.
120:27:33|C|Eng|Okay.
120:27:38|T|CDR|LiOH canister is in the -
120:27:56|T|CDR|And the rock box is sitting on the table. And I'm sure that's okay.  You know, we hardly kick up any dirt at all, Charlie. Just hardly any!
120:28:31|T|LMP|I know. Hey, John, I'll let you put this together. I'm really - Think I know how to do it, but I don't want to foul it up.
120:28:38|T|CDR|Here you go.
120:28:39|T|LMP|Everything else is ready.
120:28:40|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're over by the MESA . You can't see us. I'm putting the UHT together, and Charlie's got both packages down. And now Charlie's going for his hot stuff .
120:29:10|T|CDR|Look at that, Charlie.
120:29:29|T|LMP|I think that's good, John. Okay; I need this one right here.
120:29:34|T|CDR|Okay. I'll leave the other one up here.
120:29:36|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, I got the dome removal tool, Tony.  And it's on.
120:30:06|T|LMP|Hoo-boy. Scared me for a minute.
120:30:09|C|Eng|Okay, while you're standing still, how about an EMU check?
120:30:18|T|LMP|Okay, I got a -
120:30:19|T|CDR|What makes you think we're standing still?
120:30:23|T|LMP|I'm clear flags, 75 percent, just about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Min cooling</a>, and 3.8 .
120:30:30|C|Eng|Okay; we copy.
120:30:37|T|CDR|I threw that -
120:30:41|T|LMP|John, I threw a thing all the way over those double craters over there.
120:30:45|T|CDR|Okay, I'm going to reset the far UV. I've got the top off the hot package. Let me move this around so you don't run into it.
120:30:58|C|Eng|Okay. And I have some new settings here, too.
120:31:04|T|CDR|Okay.
120:31:10|T|LMP|Look out! Here it comes! Hot stuff!
120:31:13|T|CDR|Charlie's got it.
120:31:22|T|CDR|Okay, what's your new settings now?
120:31:25|C|Eng|Okay, they're 56 and 76.
120:31:31|T|CDR|Okay. Going to Reset.
120:31:37|T|CDR|Mark. It's - . It's pointed, and it's taking imagery now.  Damn.
120:31:46|C|Eng|Okay. I'll warn you when we get to 2 and a quarter minutes.
120:31:55|T|CDR|Okay; 56 and 76.
120:31:59|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
120:32:05|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rtg_empl.gif" title="image" target="alsj">RTG</a> is fueled.
120:32:08|C|Eng|Very good!
120:32:28|T|LMP|Okay.  You can't believe how good that water tastes. I'm gonna take a break a couple of seconds, Tony.
120:32:43|C|Eng|Okay; good show.
120:32:44|T|CDR|56 and 76?
120:32:46|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
120:32:51|T|CDR|Okay.
120:32:54|T|LMP|How's the old heart rate looking?
120:33:00|T|CDR|76. Okay.
120:33:20|C|Eng|Outstanding. You did a good down-Sun alignment.
120:33:25|T|CDR|I can't believe it. I mean, the crescent is right in the middle of that scope. I might move it a half of a degree, but I wouldn't move it any more.
120:33:40|T|LMP|Man, I'll tell you.
120:33:42|T|CDR|Okay, here's the -
120:33:43|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie; and you're okay.
120:33:46|T|CDR|Okay; here's the one - Reset. Let's go for it.
120:33:52|C|Eng|Right, just take it easy. There is no hurry.
120:33:53|T|LMP|- pack horse - . I'm going out where this -
120:33:57|T|LMP|Man, look at that breccia, John! Right there. This big, subrounded -
120:34:03|T|CDR|Okay. It's re-moding, Houston.
120:34:05|C|Eng|Okay. You should have your 2 and a quarter minutes, so any time you want to go on.
120:34:12|T|CDR|Okay.
120:34:28|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
120:34:29|T|CDR|- 12, 13, 14, 15. Reset.
120:34:34|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; it did something besides - It moved before I reset it that time.
120:34:40|C|Eng|That's okay, John; just press on.
120:34:43|T|CDR|It was -
120:34:46|C|Eng|Do you mean the camera moved?
120:34:47|T|CDR|Reset.  Yeah. When I did the 15 seconds and hit the reset, it reset again. It was moving, like it wanted to go back to Imagery.  Now it's going back to -  Okay, now it's going back to the Earth - It's going back to Spectroscopy.  Does that sound all right to you guys?
120:35:31|C|Eng|Okay, it should only have done that - Did you reset at the beginning of the 15 seconds ?
120:35:42|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
120:35:46|C|Eng|Okay, that's probably the problem there. That thing should have been crossed out on your checklist to do that reset.
120:35:54|T|CDR|Okay.
120:35:56|C|Eng|Okay, hold on a second; we'll regroup here.
120:36:04|T|CDR|You want to do it again?
120:36:16|C|Eng|Okay, John; when it comes back to Direct -
120:36:19|T|CDR|How you coming, Charlie?
120:36:20|C|Eng|- go ahead and watch for that film advance, and then time 15 seconds from the film advance. Don't do a reset when it comes back to Direct.
120:36:30|T|CDR|Okay.
120:36:37|T|LMP|Houston, I got about 20 meters away, and the RTG package fell off. It hit the dirt like a bomb. It got a little dusty, but the fins are okay and all the experiments seem to be intact.
120:36:55|C|Eng|Good show, Charlie.
120:36:56|T|CDR|We'll want to make sure we knock the dust off those connectors before we take the caps off of them.
120:37:03|T|LMP|I agree.
120:37:06|C|Eng|How did it come off that thing?
120:37:08|T|LMP|Okay, it seems to -
120:37:10|T|CDR|Okay.
120:37:13|T|LMP|Okay, it seems to be locked now, Tony. I don't know what happened. I pushed on it back at the LM but it -
120:37:19|T|CDR|3, 4 -
120:37:20|T|LMP|- just popped off.
120:37:21|T|CDR|- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, Reset. Okay; reset again, 3, 4, 5, Reset. Reset.
120:37:39|C|Eng|Outstanding, John.
120:37:40|T|CDR|Okay. It's not turning.  I think we got it that time.
120:37:46|C|Eng|Good show. We'll go into a mode change in a few seconds now, but that's okay.
120:37:56|T|CDR|Yeah, there it goes.  Gonna be able to hear that little rascal working all over the Moon .
120:38:08|C|Eng|
120:38:10|T|CDR|Okay, I'm going to shift the Cosmic Ray panel .
120:38:14|C|Eng|Okay.
120:38:15|T|CDR|And close the sequence bay door.  That red ring .
120:38:33|C|Eng|Good show, Charlie. Don't strain yourself there. Just take it easy.
120:38:35|T|LMP|Hey, Tony I'm -
120:38:39|C|Eng|In fact, just stand there for a while.
120:38:40|T|LMP|I just climbed a little ridge.  I am.
120:38:50|C|Eng|Did the top slide down?
120:38:52|T|CDR|I think the panels are exposed.  There's the top exposed with a bunch of slides in there and glasses and a black thing and, you know, I think that's what you mean, isn't it?
120:39:06|C|Eng|Right. That's right. So it worked out okay.
120:39:11|T|CDR|All righty.  God almighty, I can't believe - I don't know my own strength.
120:39:16|T|LMP|Man, Tony, this is a real - This ray pattern extends back about 200 meters - or maybe more - to the east and goes as far as we can see off to the west, which is maybe another 200 meters.  I can see Smoky Mountain now, and I can see Dome.  Kenesaw is plainly visible with two big craters on its flanks.  And if you look toward Smoky, I can see some big craters up on the top, but I can't see Ravine or North Ray yet.
120:40:02|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. You want to do the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="alsj">LCRU switch to Mode 1</a>. Or what do you want to do? And .
120:40:10|C|Eng|That's affirm; we want to go to Mode 1.
120:40:15|T|CDR|Okay, going to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LCRU.html" target="alsj">PM1/WB</a> and positioning it CCW .
120:40:23|C|Eng|John, we'd like a Batt 2 check on the way out to the ALSEP site, and you do that by turning your Left Front and Right Front Drive Powers to Bus C.
120:40:36|T|CDR|Okay.
120:40:56|T|CDR|Okay, the Nav breaker is going in, and we are reading - in the Sun shadow - we are reading 1 degree south. Pitch is zero. And roll is half a degree right.
120:41:23|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. We'll give you a torquing angle in a minute.
120:41:27|C|Eng|And would you confirm the SEQ Bay doors are shut?
120:41:31|T|CDR|Sequence bay doors are shut, and we're pointed up about 2 degrees.
120:41:36|C|Eng|Okay; pitch up 2.
120:41:37|T|CDR|I see Charlie over - Charlie's down there to the southwest.  Can I go Reset on this thing to clear these numbers off before 2 minutes?
120:41:54|C|Eng|Yeah, we can go to Reset.
120:41:58|T|CDR|Say again?
120:42:00|C|Eng|Yes, go Reset.
120:42:00|T|CDR|I missed out on the first part.
120:42:45|C|Eng|That sounds good, Charlie; and, John, it's 266.
120:42:53|T|CDR|Understand; 266.
120:42:57|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The regolith hasn't changed any out this far. We still have numerous subrounded to angular blocks, partially buried. Here's a secondary. Here's a big boulder, the one I described, that's 2 meters across with about a 50-centimeter fillet above the -
120:43:28|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, say again what you want me to do to this thing to check out the rear steering - Or check out the battery?
120:43:33|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like you to just start out with the Left Front and the Right Front Drive Powers on Bus C. If the battery 2 isn't working, you shouldn't go anywhere.
120:43:46|T|CDR|Okay, Left Front, Right Front Powers on Battery C, and 266 on the Gyro Torque.
120:44:01|T|LMP|Tony, I'm looking at this big rock, and it's a two-rock breccia. The matrix is a black rock - blackish to bluish - with some very fine, submillimeter-size crystals. The -
120:44:17|T|CDR|Hey, Houston. You won't believe this. Now our Amp-Hours on battery 2 are up, and they're reading 118 and the - and the battery - and the battery Volts are reading 62. You want the whole business before we start out? The Amp-Hours on 1 are 118; on 2, 118; 68 volts; 68 volts; no Amps, of course ; and 82 degrees on the Motor Temps, and off-scale -  82 degrees on the Batteries, and off-scale low on both Motor Temps.
120:44:52|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
120:44:54|T|CDR|I don't understand that.  Well, I just did something. No, that's all right.
120:45:07|T|LMP|John, it sure looks like we're on a more than 2-degree landing slope, but it's not.
120:45:12|T|CDR|Let's not run that battery check now that we got all those good readings, Houston.
120:45:16|T|LMP|Turn on your rear steering, John.
120:45:19|T|CDR|Okay, I've had that on, Charlie.
120:45:23|C|Eng|Okay, if everything's working.
120:45:24|T|CDR|Maybe it just needs to sit around and heat up.
120:45:32|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, back to this rock. The small frags in it are whitish in color with small millimeter-size crystals of - it looked like perhaps olivine in the white matrix, in the white clasts, let's say. And it's a biggie; it's right near the ALSEP. We'll get a picture for that. It'll show up in the pan .   John, that's gonna be some ride.
120:46:02|C|Eng|Okay, John, we'd like you to go ahead and drive out on battery 2.
120:46:09|T|CDR|Yes, it's gonna be.  Okay, you want me to pull Batt A and B circuit breakers?
120:46:13|C|Eng|No, negative. Just put the Left Front -
120:46:17|T|CDR|You want me to -
120:46:18|C|Eng|- and the Right Front to Bus C.
120:46:20|T|CDR|Okay. Left Front and Right Front are on Bus C.
120:46:31|T|CDR|Yeah, it's going like a champ.
120:46:33|C|Eng|Good show; everything looks good.
120:46:34|T|LMP|Okay, you're kicking up a - You got a small rooster tail, John, but not very much of one.
120:46:42|C|Eng|And, could you give us an Amp reading while you're driving?
120:46:45|T|CDR|Man, I tell you -  Yeah, Amp-Hours are 18 amp. Okay, I'm not doing very many clicks. Twenty-two on the front and exactly nothing on two and nothing on the other one. Charlie -
120:47:07|C|Eng|Okay; we copy.
120:47:09|T|CDR|- there's just hardly any place that hasn't got craters around here. Is that where you want to put the ALSEP?
120:47:13|T|LMP|This is as level a spot I could find.
120:47:16|T|CDR|I tell you, Houston, there's just no place that's not got craters and things around it.   Think 290 from here, huh?
120:47:28|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm about cross-Sun here.
120:47:34|T|CDR|Okay, we're 1/10 on the range and distance.
120:47:39|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that, and sometime when you're stopped, we can go back to normal -
120:47:45|T|CDR|Okay, let me turn 29 -  Maybe right over in here, Charlie, right here.
120:47:48|T|LMP|Huh?
120:47:49|T|CDR|Is that too close to the -
120:47:51|T|LMP|Is that 290?
120:47:52|T|CDR|No, let me show you 290. Like this.
120:47:58|T|LMP|Okay; that's okay.
120:48:00|T|CDR|It's right down in this hole, is what it is.
120:48:07|T|CDR|Okay, do that.  Oh boy, I tell you, this place is full of holes, Houston.  And rocks.
120:48:43|C|Eng|John, when you were back at the Cosmic Ray, did you happen to notice what the Temp label read?
120:48:51|T|CDR|No, I forgot. I forgot.
120:48:54|C|Eng|Okay.
120:48:55|T|CDR|Want to go back and get it? Be just a second in the Rover here?
120:48:58|C|Eng|No, negative.
120:49:03|T|CDR|Okay.
120:49:16|C|Eng|And, John, when you get a chance, you can go back to normal configuration on the Rover.
120:49:24|T|CDR|Okay.
120:49:25|T|LMP|How does that look out there, John?
120:49:27|T|CDR|Charlie, it looks like everything else around here: full of holes.
120:49:31|T|LMP|I know it, and lots of craters.
120:49:33|T|CDR|Lots of craters. We're not lacking for them, Houston.
120:49:44|T|LMP|Tony, this is just an indescribable experience. I'll tell you.
120:49:52|C|Eng|I bet it is, Charlie. Hey, what's the difference between a hole and a crater?
120:50:02|T|LMP|Beats me.
120:50:11|T|CDR|Man, this has just got to be - If the number of craters are any indication, this has got to be old material. Even the craters have craters.
120:50:44|T|LMP|Man, I am black already, from the knees down.
120:50:52|T|CDR|Okay, have you got the Central Station lined up?
120:50:55|T|LMP|East-west.
120:50:57|T|CDR|Yeah. You gonna deploy your drill down there, huh?
120:51:06|T|LMP|To the south. Okay, you need to park -
120:51:11|T|CDR|I'll park over there by that rock, Charlie. Heading 180?
120:51:16|T|LMP|Yeah, that'd be good.
120:51:18|T|CDR|195.
120:51:19|T|LMP|Yeah, that'll be good. Great.
120:51:56|T|LMP|We're sort of dusty here.
120:51:58|T|CDR|Okay, and we're -
120:52:02|T|LMP|Tony, I'm tapping the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rtg_empl.gif" title="image" target="alsj">RTG</a> fins to get the dust off of them, and it's flaking - It's coming off real good.
120:52:10|C|Eng|Okay, very good.
120:52:16|T|LMP|I'm sorry about dropping that thing, Tony; but, golly, -
120:52:19|C|Eng|No, we understand.
120:52:20|T|LMP|- it appeared locked to me, but it just came sailing off of there.
120:52:26|C|Eng|It's going outstanding, Charlie.
120:52:38|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. And the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="alsj">seatbelt</a> worked; I'm pleased to report.
120:52:48|T|CDR|Oh ho, boy!  That's as near as I can make it to 60 foot, Charlie.
120:52:56|T|LMP|Hey, that looks great, John. That's perfect.
120:53:15|T|CDR|It sure looks sandy to me, Charlie .
120:54:49|T|CDR|Charlie, does that thing look like it's pointing at the Earth? I don't -
120:54:53|T|LMP|Can you see the Earth?
120:54:55|T|CDR|No.
120:54:56|T|LMP|It looks pretty close, to me. It's almost vertical.
120:55:01|T|CDR|There we go. There it is. Oh, you little rascal, no wonder I couldn't find you.
120:55:11|T|LMP|It's not very big.
120:55:12|T|CDR|I got it. It's beautiful. Houston, you ought to have it now. It's beautiful.
120:55:22|T|LMP|Is Houston reading you, John?
120:55:24|T|CDR|Houston, do you read? Over.
120:55:25|C|Eng|Now we're copying you 5 by, and we got a picture.
120:55:31|T|CDR|Okay; fine.
120:55:34|T|LMP|Tony, I'm stopping a little short on the Heat Flow Electronics because, if I go on out, I'd be in a little crater and I couldn't get it leveled. Over.
120:55:58|T|CDR|That little crater might be -  That little crater just might be what-you-call-it, you know?  I think we may have come a little further than we thought we were going to, Houston. I see Double Spot back there - or what looks like Double Spot - and we're a good ways past that.
120:56:35|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that.
120:56:40|T|CDR|Let's see, there's the craters.  Okay.
120:57:00|T|LMP|John, we're not much off, I'll tell you.
120:57:04|T|CDR|Yeah, I hope not, Charlie.
120:57:13|C|Eng|John, did you happen to notice what heading you were driving on the way out to the ALSEP site?
120:57:20|T|CDR|I wasn't watching it, to be honest with you. I was trying to keep sight of old Charlie. You can get lost out here.
120:57:36|T|LMP|Gummit.
120:57:59|T|LMP|- Boyd-bolt release.
120:58:18|T|LMP|There we go.  comes that beauty.
120:58:35|T|LMP|Boy, I'll tell you, John, getting your alignments up here is gonna be something.
120:58:48|T|CDR|Okay. We'll work that problem, Charlie, when the time comes.
120:58:51|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the old idiot-proof decal has made it - The probe is in the left hand, and the wires are not crossed.
120:59:05|C|Eng|Very good.
120:59:19|T|CDR|Okay; the temperature - The shorting plug is pulled and the temperature reading is reading about like - Golly! I can't believe it. It's reading about like three-quarter scale.
120:59:39|T|LMP|Tony, let me give you a question here. The down-Sun heat probe is gonna be within 2 meters of about a 5-meter crater. Over. That's maybe a meter deep. Is that okay, or do you want me to move it?
120:59:57|C|Eng|Can you move it to a crater-free area?
121:00:03|T|LMP|Yes, I can; but it'll be more towards the portable -  I mean the LSM .
121:00:12|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like to do that.
121:00:16|T|LMP|Okay. Now the one up-Sun is perfect, straight up-Sun.
121:00:22|C|Eng|Very good.
121:00:34|T|LMP|Yeah, this is a super place right here for this up-Sun one. Okay, here we go with a big drill coming up!
121:00:44|T|LMP|Down into the crater he goes. There's a secondary. Little one. Looks like the big eye is looking at something else .
121:00:54|T|CDR|Yeah.
121:00:58|T|LMP|Boy, John, I'm gonna need about 23 gallons of water. This stuff sure tastes good.
121:01:08|T|CDR|Okay, that connector is made, somehow. And -
121:01:15|T|LMP|Okay; drill.
121:01:18|T|CDR|back over here and straighten out the line.
121:01:22|C|Eng|Now, while you're standing over at the Rover there, could you read off the heading?
121:01:25|T|LMP|Well, I almost tried -  Oh, yeah, bearing to the LM is 033, the heading is 195.
121:01:36|C|Eng|Okay; 195.
121:01:41|T|LMP|Rog.
121:01:55|T|CDR|It's hard to believe.
121:01:57|T|LMP|What's that, John?
121:01:59|T|CDR|That line between the - see it - the Central Station and the ALSEP is gonna float in the air.
121:02:07|T|LMP|Yeah, things are really stiff, aren't they?
121:02:10|T|CDR|Yeah.  Okay, the collar is locked on the Central Station. I'm gonna get the subpallet, here.
121:02:34|T|LMP|Oh, I did it again. Wrong end.  Get in there.  Okay, the handle is in. Oh. Here comes the old -flicky here.
121:03:07|T|CDR|Houston, do you want us to tilt that package - That RTG package is okay with dirt on its floor, isn't it? Does it need to be all white?
121:03:24|C|Eng|Okay, we'll work that.  No, it doesn't have to be all white.
121:03:31|T|CDR|Okay. That's my first question of the day.  Okay.
121:03:34|C|Eng|our first answer.
121:03:36|T|CDR|I didn't think it had thermal problems.
121:03:42|T|LMP|Tony, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../drill_21.gif" title="image" target="alsj">drill</a> tripod deployed just as advertised.
121:03:51|C|Eng|Very good.
121:04:06|T|LMP|I knew I was gonna do that. I knew it!
121:04:23|C|Eng|I see it doesn't stand up any better there than it does here, does it?
121:04:44|T|LMP|I'm getting where I can bend down in that suit, Tony. When I first started off, I was going head over heels, but now -
121:04:51|T|LMP|Look at that stupid thing. There.  Okay, one more pin.  -  Lock the collar, and the drill is loose.  Here come the core stems.
121:05:36|T|LMP|Walking into a little 3-meter crater here, Tony, you can see. Really dig in when you go into those craters.
121:05:47|C|Eng|Man, that is a rocky place, isn't it?
121:05:49|T|LMP|Boy, my suit feels good.
121:05:52|T|LMP|Sure is. Hey, John, will I be in your way right here?
121:06:00|T|CDR|For what?
121:06:02|T|LMP|I'm gonna have to drill away from that crater. Tony, I'm about 4 or 5 meters away, is that okay? From that crater I described?
121:06:08|C|Eng|That sounds good.
121:06:12|T|LMP|Okay, we'll start drilling right here, then.
121:06:21|T|CDR|Well, I don't think - That won't be any problem. The only thing goes down past there is the LSM.
121:06:28|T|LMP|That's what I thought.
121:06:29|T|CDR|And we may have to deploy the LSM out behind the ALSEP anyway to get it from going down in that little crater there. I think 50 foot will put me right in that hole. What do you think of that, Houston, if I deploy the LSM behind Charlie's thing here? Can y'all see this on the tube ?
121:07:15|T|LMP|You know, John, you need about two patches of Velcro. It'd hold the whole thing. You got about 95 - There it comes.
121:07:32|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;Level and align experiments package, by eyeball.&quot;
121:07:43|C|Eng|Okay, that's okay, John. We understand you're going to deploy it almost due west of the RTG?
121:07:51|T|CDR|Right.
121:08:08|C|Eng|Okay, and we need about 30 feet between that heat flow hole and the LSM.
121:08:26|T|CDR|Understand. We'll give you that.
121:08:31|C|Eng|Very good.
121:09:13|T|LMP|Whoo! Finally got it, Tony.
121:09:15|C|Eng|Very good.
121:09:20|T|LMP|For a minute there I was worried. Okay. I can stab it into the ground about -
121:09:40|C|Eng|Outstanding.
121:09:49|T|LMP|Guess what?
121:09:50|C|Eng|It slowed down.
121:09:51|T|LMP|It's not going in. Something hard in there.  Whatever it was, we got through it, Tony. It's speeding up again.
121:10:10|C|Eng|Okay, good show.
121:10:13|T|LMP|Right on down now. It's super now. It must have been a rock. I'm sure the regolith is covered with -
121:10:25|C|Eng|Very good, Charlie.
121:10:32|T|CDR|Golly, Charlie.  Help me when you get finished.
121:10:37|T|LMP|Okay, that ain't gonna work.
121:10:55|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the foot mashie is not gonna work.
121:10:58|C|Eng|Yeah, we were watching.
121:11:00|T|LMP|Gonna have to use the wrench.
121:11:01|C|Eng|Okay.
121:11:32|T|LMP|That works like a champ.
121:11:34|C|Eng|Right. That new wrench is pretty slick.
121:11:39|T|LMP|Yeah, it is.
121:11:45|T|CDR|Why don't you open?
121:11:53|T|LMP|fall over, drill.
121:12:04|T|LMP|Ah ha!
121:12:06|C|Eng|Ah, Charlie, such form.
121:12:11|T|LMP|-  How about that?
121:12:13|T|LMP|I'm going out for the ballet when I get back. You learn another line of work up here.
121:12:25|T|LMP|Hey, that was fantastic news about the House passing the bill, Tony. It really started a great day today for us.
121:12:41|C|Eng|We sure agree.
121:12:47|T|LMP|Okay. Man, you can't believe how happy I am that went in there.
121:12:56|T|CDR|Tony, he's very happy.
121:13:11|C|Eng|Mark 's pretty happy too.
121:13:17|T|LMP|Well -
121:13:53|T|LMP|Look at that beauty go again!
121:13:55|C|Eng|Okay, give it time to clean the flutes.
121:14:01|T|LMP|I'm not leaning on it. It may appear that I am leaning on it, Tony; but I guarantee you I am not.
121:14:08|C|Eng|Okay, we understand.
121:14:11|T|LMP|Okay. It's run into something hard down there. I can feel the torque; but whatever it is, it's going through it. Yep, it was through it.
121:14:31|T|LMP|Oh boy, thank goodness for that wrench.  Never would be able to do that with the foot mashie.
121:15:17|T|LMP|Hot dog.
121:15:18|C|Eng|Oh, beautiful!
121:15:36|T|LMP|Okay!
121:15:44|T|CDR|Almost got it.
121:15:48|T|LMP|Hey, John, it looks great. How can you get that thing leveled out there? Amazing.
121:16:11|T|CDR|Okay, it's level; but the Sun reading is 064-1/2. Is that okay, Houston?
121:16:28|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. Say that again, John.
121:16:34|T|CDR|064-1/2. I pointed it at that thing that said &quot;Sun&quot;, but that sure didn't do it. I guess you can handle that.
121:17:14|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; switch 5 is clockwise.
121:17:20|T|LMP|Mark. Okay, I'll call it quits on that one, Tony.
121:17:33|T|LMP|Are you reading, Houston?
121:17:35|C|Eng|We copy that.
121:17:46|C|Eng|Okay, John, we understand you have the skirt out ?
121:17:52|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
121:17:54|C|Eng|Okay.
121:17:56|T|CDR|Can't you see it on the TV?
121:17:57|C|Eng|We're just now coming around there. Okay, that 064 will be fine, there.
121:18:02|T|CDR|It ought to blind you .
121:18:48|C|Eng|John, do you remember where the bubble was on the top of the PSE?
121:18:54|T|CDR|In the middle !
121:18:56|C|Eng|Very good. I should have known.
121:19:08|T|CDR|Oh, I was afraid of this.
121:19:10|T|LMP|What's wrong.
121:19:11|T|CDR|Charlie?
121:19:12|T|LMP|Huh?
121:19:14|T|CDR|This thing pulled so hard that it pulled the Central Station.
121:19:17|T|LMP|Yeah. Can't you re-align it later?
121:19:20|T|CDR|Yeah, that's a thought.
121:19:22|T|LMP|That was my problem with the RTG package, I -
121:19:52|T|CDR|There; it's okay. Just that first bunch that we didn't get.
121:20:01|T|LMP|Yeah.  Okay, Tony, I now have the right-handed rammer.
121:20:41|T|LMP|And Tony, Mark has his first one - all the way in to the red mark - on the Cayley Plain.
121:20:50|C|Eng|Outstanding! The first one in the highlands.
121:21:08|T|CDR|Ask him what we're going to do if the temperature shows like it does at Hadley.
121:21:21|T|LMP|the thermal cover is in to the second red mark. And, Tony, the probe is out of the ground up to B-8. Right on the line between B-7 and B-8.
121:21:45|T|CDR|Charlie.
121:21:46|T|LMP|What?
121:21:47|T|CDR|Something happened here.
121:21:48|T|LMP|What happened?
121:21:49|T|CDR|I don't know.  Here's a line that pulled loose.
121:21:57|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
121:21:58|T|CDR|What is that? What line is it?
121:22:02|T|LMP|That's the heat flow. You've pulled it off.
121:22:11|T|CDR|Pulled loose from there?
121:22:12|T|LMP|Yeah.
121:22:14|T|CDR|God almighty.
121:22:17|T|LMP|Well, I'm wasting my time.
121:22:20|T|CDR|I'm sorry. I didn't even know - I didn't even know it.  Agh; it's sure gone.
121:22:34|C|Eng|Did the wire or the connector come off?
121:22:36|T|CDR|had our first catastrophe. It's broke right at the connector.
121:22:42|T|LMP|The wire came off at the connector.
121:22:45|C|Eng|Okay, I guess we can forget the rest of that heat flow.
121:22:55|T|LMP|Yeah, I'll go do the .  Oh, rats!
121:23:02|T|CDR|I'm sorry, Charlie. God Damn -
121:23:04|T|LMP|
121:23:05|T|CDR|- I didn't even know it.
121:23:08|T|LMP|A bunch of spaghetti over there.
121:23:11|C|Eng|Boy, we can sure see that on TV. It looks like a mess.
121:23:26|T|LMP|Well, tell Mark we're sorry. Is there no way we can recover from that, Tony?
121:23:34|C|Eng|I'm sure we're working it.
121:23:41|T|LMP|I'll go over and get the -
121:23:47|C|Eng|We understand that the cable came off the connector, and we've got just the free end of the cable, is that right?
121:23:54|T|LMP|That's right.
121:24:53|T|CDR|Okay.
121:25:36|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, starting on the deep drill.
121:26:04|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that, Charlie, and hold back on that drill a little bit. It'll probably try to auger in on you a bit.
121:26:22|T|LMP|Tony, if there is some way we could get that connector off of there, we might be able to take the whole - the electronics - Naw, we can't do that either; the whole thing's hooked up.
121:27:15|T|CDR|Okay, the LSM is on the surface. I'm going to deploy the Central Station.
121:27:19|C|Eng|Okay.
121:28:48|T|CDR|These wires have - They have memory in them, and they stay crinkled up in odd manners here. I didn't realize that.
121:29:00|C|Eng|All right, John; we can sure see that.
121:29:36|C|Eng|Okay.
121:29:52|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
121:29:55|T|CDR|Just a minute, Charlie.
121:29:56|T|LMP|Fell down.
121:30:17|T|LMP|Agh! There we go.
121:31:41|T|LMP|I bet you that looks like a comedy of errors on the tube.  - got a little dusty.
121:31:47|C|Eng|Nah; it's coming along fine there, Charlie.
121:31:56|T|LMP|The problem is that the bit won't stay stuck in the ground; and when I try to get this stuff on, it spins the whole deal, instead of the -
121:32:33|C|Eng|That's a new one.
121:33:11|T|LMP|That drill is so good it's hard to get off.
121:33:18|C|Eng|Right.
121:33:19|T|LMP|I mean, not the drill but the bit - the wrench. Okay, second one going in, Tony.
121:33:32|C|Eng|Right. Don't hurry it.
121:33:33|T|LMP|I'm holding back on it this time.
121:33:34|C|Eng|Good show.
121:34:22|T|LMP|Okay, the second one went in with no problem, Tony.
121:34:24|C|Eng|Good show.
121:34:34|T|LMP|Man, what a place.
121:34:54|T|CDR|Okay, the Central Station is erected.
121:34:58|C|Eng|Okay.  And you're Go for the shorting switch when you get there .
121:35:09|T|CDR|Okay.
121:35:47|T|LMP|That beauty just doesn't want to come off.  Okay, last one going on, Tony.
121:36:49|C|Eng|Okay.
121:36:50|T|LMP|Then we'll see if we can get that beauty out of the ground.
121:36:57|C|Eng|Ah, think positive, Charlie.
121:37:52|T|LMP|I tell you, this ain't the cleanest place I've ever been in my life. Ooh! Dust is everywhere.
121:38:19|T|LMP|Okay, last one, Tony.
121:38:21|T|LMP|Mark.
121:38:23|C|Eng|Okay.
121:38:28|T|LMP|And I feel a little clutch slippage, but not much.
121:38:34|C|Eng|Okay. Just take it slow and easy.
121:38:38|T|LMP|Slowly going in.  That's what I'm doing; just letting it do the work.
121:39:42|C|Eng|All right, Charlie. Remember to spin it free -
121:39:44|T|LMP|Mark.
121:39:45|C|Eng|Spin it free for 15 seconds without letting it go down if you can .
121:39:51|T|LMP|I am. I was just going to see if I was down far enough.
121:39:54|C|Eng|Okay.
121:40:03|C|Eng|Beautiful.
121:40:09|C|Eng|Don't strain yourself there, Charlie.
121:40:13|T|LMP|I'm not.  I think I better use the jack.
121:40:22|C|Eng|Okay.
121:40:23|T|LMP|When I was spinning it free, Tony, I felt like it was going to come right on out; but it's sort of hung up now.
121:40:35|C|Eng|Okay, we understand.
121:40:36|T|LMP|I got it out about one stem width - length.
121:40:40|C|Eng|Okay.
121:41:34|C|Eng|Okay.
121:41:46|C|Eng|And, Charlie, when you get that core out, we would like you to measure the hole with the rammer jammer.
121:41:52|T|LMP|Yeah, I am.  Okay, right in here, Tony; we really sink in on that rim of that little crater.
121:42:11|T|LMP|How's your TV?
121:42:12|C|Eng|Excellent. Outstanding.
121:42:17|T|LMP|Good.
121:42:24|C|Eng|And if you get tired there, Charlie, just take a break.
121:42:48|T|CDR|Hey, Houston. I think the antenna is aligned and pointing at you.
121:42:55|C|Eng|Okay, John.
121:43:03|T|CDR|And it's level; believe it or not.
121:43:16|C|Eng|And, Charlie, Deke says you don't look any better than normal.
121:43:24|T|LMP|If the boss says that, I agree with him; yes, sir.
121:43:32|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're going to push the shorting switch.
121:43:42|T|CDR|Okay, the amps go to zero on the gauge. Is that what they're supposed to do?
121:43:45|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
121:43:47|T|CDR|And Switch 1 is going clockwise.  Switch 5 is going counter-clockwise.
121:44:04|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The top of the core - the deep core - has got cap number A.
121:44:10|C|Eng|Okay, deep core, cap A. And, John, we've got a good ALSEP.
121:44:18|T|CDR|Yeah, I knew it was a good one. Gee whiz.
121:45:11|T|CDR|There.
121:45:31|T|LMP|Well, you can't believe it, Tony, but that beauty is coming out.
121:45:34|C|Eng|Outstanding. And we've proved the lever principle again.
121:45:49|T|LMP|Yep.
121:46:53|C|Eng|Very good.
121:46:54|T|LMP|- on this beauty.
121:47:35|C|Eng|Looks like it's a good thing we had that jack.
121:48:51|C|Eng|Hey, Charlie, take it easy. Let's rest for a minute.
121:48:57|T|LMP|Okay, how's the old heartbeat?
121:48:59|C|Eng|You're up to about 140.
121:49:04|T|LMP|Okay. Doesn't feel like hard work.
121:49:28|T|LMP|John, is that going to be all right next to that rock?
121:49:33|T|CDR|I don't have any idea, Charlie. Sure hope so, 'cause there ain't much other place to put it. If it ain't next to the rock, it's going to be in that hole right next to it.
121:49:41|T|LMP|Yeah, I see what you mean.
121:49:45|T|CDR|This isn't the world's greatest place to deploy ALSEP. I'll tell you that.
121:50:08|C|Eng|John, how far are you from that rock?
121:50:14|T|CDR|It's about 3 feet. You want to move it farther than that? How far do you want to be? I'll pick it up and move it.
121:50:23|C|Eng|Okay. We're thinking about that.
121:50:39|C|Eng|John, I guess they would like you to try to move it away from that rock and, on the distance, just as far as you can without getting it in trouble there - jerking it around.
121:50:54|T|CDR|Okay, can I pick it up by its arms and - If I promise to be <i>real</i> careful with it?
121:51:04|C|Eng|Okay. They have re-evaluated the whole thing and decided, since you left - I guess they didn't want it -
121:51:07|C|Eng|- very badly, and they said just leave it where it is. It looks fine.
121:51:13|T|CDR|Okay. I can probably get down on my knees and get it underneath its little box -
121:51:17|C|Eng|And, Charlie.
121:51:18|T|CDR|- but it's leveled, and
121:51:22|T|LMP|Yeah?
121:51:23|C|Eng|On that hole, there, instead of putting the rammer-jammer down it, I guess we would like to put the second heat flow probe down the hole and then measure it with the rammer-jammer, how far it went, and just leave the heat flow probe in the hole. Does it reach over there?
121:51:41|T|LMP|The probe?
121:51:42|C|Eng|That's right, the heat flow probe.
121:51:45|T|LMP|Or the -  No, I don't think it will reach, Tony.
121:51:50|C|Eng|Okay, then, just go ahead and measure the hole .
121:51:52|T|LMP|Y'all going to give up on the heat flow?
121:51:57|C|Eng|Well, we'll probably have to;  haven't got a firm decision, yet.
121:52:04|T|LMP|I'd like to save that stuff until you make a firm decision.
121:52:10|C|Eng|Okay.
121:52:22|T|LMP|I'd rather drill one . I don't think it'll reach . I'll try it, but -
121:52:29|T|CDR|Okay. The LSM is level and aligned. The Sun is right in the middle of the shadow.
121:52:37|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, John. Very good.
121:52:43|T|CDR|I mean the Sun is right in the middle of the alignment marks.
121:52:46|C|Eng|Okay.
121:52:55|T|LMP|How about that, Tony!
121:52:56|C|Eng|Outstanding!
121:52:57|T|LMP|Did you see that?
121:52:58|C|Eng|I'd say the hole stayed open.
121:53:00|T|LMP|All the way down, I just dropped the rammer into it and it just fell in.
121:53:16|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. We're about ready to go with the geophones here.
121:53:19|T|LMP|Wait a minute. I got the most beautiful thing here. I got to pick this up, before I lose it.
121:53:33|T|LMP|Agh!
121:53:46|C|Eng|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-BlowOffTheDust.html" target="alsj">Blow on it.</a>
121:53:50|T|LMP|Huh?
121:53:51|C|Eng|Blow on it.
121:53:53|T|CDR|What did you say, Tony?
121:53:56|T|LMP|Yeah. I was going to.
121:54:13|T|CDR|Come on, Charlie.
121:54:14|T|LMP|I'm coming. Let me put this over here .
121:54:46|T|LMP|Tony, on the rim of that little crater, as I walked through there, there was a - Underneath the regolith there was a white area. I kicked up some very white soil, about 3 centimeters down.
121:55:09|T|LMP|Oh, I forgot the camera.
121:55:10|C|Eng|Roger.
121:55:12|T|LMP|-
121:55:15|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I got it.
121:55:17|T|LMP|- . Okay.
121:55:19|T|CDR|Okay.
121:55:20|T|LMP|I'll get it; let me have it.
121:55:24|T|CDR|Whoa, Charlie!!!
121:55:25|T|LMP|Huh? How's that?
121:55:29|T|CDR|Watch out for those cables behind you.
121:55:30|T|LMP|Okay. I am.
121:55:36|T|CDR|That's pretty good.
121:55:39|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I stuffed the geophone stake in, by just pushing on it about, oh, a - about a foot. Y'all better think about that two-tenths cone penetration at Stop 10. It looks like the five would be the best, all the way out. I think I'll just go right up to the hilt with the two.
121:56:10|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.
121:56:15|T|CDR|Watch out, Charlie.
121:56:16|T|LMP|Okay. I was just waiting to get the dumb heat thing.
121:56:30|T|CDR|There.
121:56:31|T|LMP|John, things just stand up - The wires everything just stands up off the ground about 6 inches here.
121:56:40|T|CDR|I know it. Never thought of that. We should have - - We never thought of that.
121:56:50|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.
121:57:02|T|LMP|This is gonna be the trick of the week.
121:57:07|T|CDR|You did it, Charlie. Not only has he gotten the geophone in the ground, he's got it buried in the ground.
121:57:13|T|LMP|Super! Okay. This is going to be a lot easier than carrying that big - other backpack.
121:57:24|T|CDR|Keep an eye on this, Charlie.
121:57:26|T|LMP|I got you. I got you.
121:57:27|T|CDR|Okay. Now I'm going out and parallel these tracks.
121:57:29|T|LMP|Okay. Let me make sure
121:57:30|T|CDR|You want the hammer?
121:57:31|T|LMP|No, go ahead. I just want to -
121:57:34|T|CDR|You don't need the hammer; we don't need the hammer.
121:57:35|T|LMP|I know it.
121:57:36|T|CDR|The other stake is over there.
121:57:37|T|LMP|Oh, okay. Near the pallet?
121:57:40|T|CDR|Yeah.
121:57:41|T|LMP|Okay. I'll get it.
121:57:45|T|LMP|Sounds like the camera re-moding.
121:57:47|T|CDR|Yeah.
121:57:51|T|CDR|Make sure that it's not pulling too hard on that wire back there.
121:57:53|T|LMP|No; it's great, John.
121:57:55|C|Eng|Yeah, Charlie. I think you need a camera .
121:57:59|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm going to get one. I'll go run get it now.
121:58:02|C|Eng|Okay.
121:58:03|T|CDR|No, Charlie! Watch and see where this line comes out.
121:58:06|T|LMP|Okay. I'd better do that, Tony. I'll get the camera .
121:58:09|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
121:58:11|T|LMP|just a minute. Okay?
121:58:12|C|Eng|No hurry.
121:58:15|T|LMP|We know we need a - Okay. You're walking a little bit sideways, John; you're pulling against it with your left side. There you go. Looking good, John. The geophone's still in, and the stake is looking good.
121:58:48|T|LMP|Going great.
121:59:02|T|CDR|Trouble is, the average guy doesn't realize how far 100 meters is.
121:59:07|T|LMP|I know it.
121:59:09|T|CDR|Especially me.
121:59:12|C|Eng|Roger; 2 inches at a time like that, it's a long way.
121:59:19|T|LMP|Ah, the footprints on the Moon! Can't believe it!
121:59:24|C|Eng|Ah, that's all right. They'll probably erode away in about 4 billion years.
121:59:28|T|LMP|The regolith -
121:59:31|T|CDR|What's that, Charlie?
121:59:33|T|LMP|What's what?
121:59:34|T|CDR|That thing hanging up there.
121:59:35|T|LMP|No, it's okay. Man, that's a long way, John! Stake is still up .
121:59:44|T|CDR|Okay.
121:59:45|T|LMP|Keep going. Okay, there's a double one.
121:59:46|T|CDR|There's a double one.
121:59:47|T|LMP|There's a double one. run around, and get in front of you here.
122:00:01|T|CDR|There they come.
122:00:02|T|LMP|There they come.
122:00:03|T|CDR|Here we are!
122:00:04|T|LMP|Okay, here we are.
122:00:09|T|CDR|Agh.
122:00:16|T|LMP|- Got it.
122:00:24|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
122:00:26|T|CDR|Okay. That's right, we have to put that in before we put the stake in.
122:00:29|T|LMP|Yeah, I can't do anything till I get that in.  Come on.
122:00:49|T|LMP|Guess what?
122:00:50|T|CDR|Beautiful, Charlie.
122:00:55|T|LMP|Okay, that one's buried too, Tony.
122:00:58|T|CDR|Charlie buries the geophones.
122:01:01|C|Eng|Okay.
122:01:03|T|LMP|Pull it out this way.
122:01:04|T|CDR|It pulled out this way.
122:01:05|T|CDR|No, that's right.
122:01:06|T|LMP|No, you want it this way, don't you?
122:01:07|T|CDR|No, that's right. That's right.
122:01:08|T|LMP|Yeah.
122:01:11|T|CDR|Not so hard!!
122:01:12|T|LMP|Why?
122:01:13|T|CDR|Liable to cut the line.
122:01:14|T|LMP|Oh no; it's all right. You're right about that - We're all right.
122:01:20|T|CDR|Get the flag open, so we can see it.
122:01:21|T|LMP|Yeah. Sorry. Okay. I'm going to get a camera. You all set?
122:01:25|T|CDR|Yep.
122:01:26|T|LMP|Watch out. You got it crooked, John. Whoop. Right here on this side, your right .
122:01:34|T|CDR|Yeah, okay.
122:01:35|T|LMP|Okay; there you go.
122:01:36|T|CDR|Thank you.
122:01:37|T|LMP|Yes, sir. About to get it again. There you go. Okay. The stake's holding fine. Adios.
122:01:48|T|CDR|Adios.
122:01:57|T|CDR|It's a far cry from that -
122:02:07|T|CDR|Charlie.
122:02:09|T|LMP|Where's the - Hey, Tony, where is the Bendix air compressors?
122:02:14|C|Eng|It doesn't look right with them not out there.
122:02:23|T|LMP|I'll tell you this one-sixth gravity feels a lot better .  Tony, when I first started with that jack, the ground was so soft, I thought the thing had failed like it did in the last training, but it had not. It just worked great.
122:02:43|C|Eng|Outstanding.
122:02:52|T|LMP|How about that pace, huh?
122:03:29|T|CDR|the force to deploy this thing, I can sense, is exactly the same as it was in one g. And I keep wondering when the power wire is going to bust .
122:03:46|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I have LMP's camera.
122:03:50|C|Eng|Okay.
122:04:01|T|LMP|The back of - The bottom of the bit is with Bravo. And I'm going back out and take some pictures.
122:04:11|C|Eng|Okay.
122:04:12|T|LMP|John has disappeared over the horizon!!
122:04:22|T|LMP|John, how about an EMU status check? You pulled out your pin on your purge valve.
122:04:23|T|CDR|I'm doing okay. 70 - 50, 60, 73 percent is what I read.
122:04:47|T|LMP|Okay. Well, you still must be locked. Your pin's out. I picked it up, and it's under your seat.
122:04:54|T|CDR|Okay.
122:04:55|T|LMP|right next to the Rover.
122:04:56|T|CDR|Well, we'll get it.
122:04:59|T|LMP|Hey, you out there?
122:05:00|T|CDR|Yeah, I'm out here. Wait a minute until I stick up the flag.
122:05:05|T|LMP|Okay. All &quot;ALSEP taken at f/11, 1/250.&quot;
122:05:31|T|CDR|I guess that's a pretty straight line, Charlie.
122:05:38|T|CDR|Wait a minute. I haven't got the flag up.
122:05:40|T|LMP|Okay.
122:05:41|C|Eng|Charlie, we'd like you -
122:05:42|T|LMP|Tony, there's a -
122:05:43|C|Eng|- to put John's pin back in.
122:05:47|T|LMP|All right, I'll go get it; just a moment. Man, that sky is black.
122:06:05|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Ready for the first ALSEP . It's set on zero; we'll go to 1. Ready for the first geophone to fire. Are you all set for that, Houston?
122:06:16|C|Eng|Stand by one.
122:06:20|T|CDR|Oh.
122:06:31|T|CDR|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-BlowOffTheDust.html" target="alsj">Blow it off</a>, Charlie.
122:06:32|T|LMP|Oh, I can't do that.
122:06:33|C|Eng|Okay. I guess we're going to have to have you stand still for a little bit here while we calibrate something. While you're doing that, how about an EMU check, and did you get that pin back in?
122:06:45|T|CDR|I'm 100 yards from Charlie.
122:06:46|C|Eng|Understand.
122:06:48|T|CDR|That's 100 meters. 3.85 and I'm <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">between Minimum and Intermediate on the cooling</a>. I got 73 percent and no flags. You want me to run on back to Charlie and get that ?
122:07:09|C|Eng|Negative.
122:07:16|T|CDR|It must have pulled out on the geophone somehow. Where did you pick it up, Charlie?
122:07:21|T|LMP|Right next to your - to the Rover.
122:07:25|T|CDR|Huh.
122:07:29|C|Eng|Okay, John. We're ready for the thumper.
122:07:30|T|CDR|You sure it isn't yours.
122:07:31|T|LMP|No, it's yours.
122:07:34|T|CDR|Okay.
122:07:35|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I got 60 percent. I'm all clear on the flags, my pressure gauge is 3.8.
122:07:43|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Hold still.
122:07:45|T|LMP|I'm still.
122:07:48|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire. Ha, ha, ha! Look at that.
122:08:06|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Hold still.
122:08:09|T|LMP|Okay.
122:08:10|T|CDR|Number 2, Houston. 4, 3, 2, 1, Fire. Nope; let me try that again.
122:08:33|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire. fired. Okay , Charlie.
122:08:53|C|Eng|Hey, John. We got an outstanding signal here; it looks great!
122:09:00|T|CDR|Okay. It's shaking the ground. Number 3, Houston.
122:09:07|T|LMP|I'm steady.
122:09:14|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:09:25|C|Eng|Ah, you got a beauty there, John.
122:09:27|T|CDR|Okay , Charlie.

122:09:49|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:10:02|C|Eng|Charlie, when you get a minute there, we got a couple of questions.
122:10:04|T|CDR|Okay.
122:10:08|T|LMP|Go ahead.
122:10:10|C|Eng|We would like for you to look at the end of that heat flow cable that was broken off and tell us how far from the heat central station it broke, and also describe the end of the broken cable. If you can get that in between , when John's walking.
122:10:26|T|LMP|Hey, John. Stand by a minute, let me stand up here.
122:10:31|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Number 5, Houston. You ready to hold still, Charlie?
122:10:36|T|LMP|No, wait a minute. Let me get up, and then I'll hold still.
122:10:39|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
122:10:41|T|CDR|Okay.
122:10:44|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:11:01|T|CDR|Sound doesn't travel too good in a vacuum. I don't hear a thing. But it jumped. Okay, Charlie, I'm going to the next station now.
122:11:12|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the - I'm going to be still, John, so you just go ahead.
122:11:18|T|CDR|Okay, number 6.
122:11:23|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:11:54|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
122:11:57|T|CDR|Number 7, Houston.
122:12:01|C|Eng|How does the connector look? Is there any damage on it?
122:12:09|T|CDR|Okay.
122:12:10|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:12:29|T|LMP|Tony, there's no damage on the connector. Over.
122:12:38|T|CDR|Number 8, Houston.
122:12:45|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:12:59|T|CDR|Okay. Am I holding still long enough?
122:13:07|C|Eng|Yes.
122:13:25|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:13:31|C|Eng|Okay.
122:14:04|T|CDR|Number 10, Houston. 4, 3, 2, 1, Fire. Hey, Tony, did you get my question about am I holding still long enough?
122:14:22|C|Eng|Yes, you're holding still long enough.
122:14:28|T|CDR|Okay.
122:14:32|T|LMP|you moving, John?
122:14:33|T|CDR|Yeah.
122:14:34|T|LMP|Okay.
122:14:50|T|CDR|Houston, do you want - Answer me, do you want me to do one by the geophone, or do I skip that one? The central geophone. There's a white thing by it.
122:15:02|C|Eng|The one right by the central geophone; yes, we do want.
122:15:08|T|CDR|Okay.
122:15:11|C|Eng|The one we don't want is the next one along the cable.
122:15:16|T|CDR|Yeah, okay. I remember now.
122:15:20|T|LMP|Wait a minute, John. Okay.
122:15:31|T|CDR|Okay. Houston. 4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:15:48|C|Eng|Okay, we're sure getting good signals here, John.
122:15:57|T|CDR|Okay. The next one we skip because it has got a black wire on it.
122:16:17|T|CDR|Okay, number 12, Houston. 4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:16:49|T|CDR|Number 13, Houston. 4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:17:09|T|LMP|It's firing, babe, I'll tell ya.
122:17:11|T|CDR|It's getting me all dirty.
122:17:14|C|Eng|Great. Not great it's getting you all dirty; great it's working.
122:17:24|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, one of the arms of the LSM, when I pull the sunshade, the arm to the northwest  does not lock.
122:17:42|T|CDR|Well, lock it, Charlie.
122:17:43|T|LMP|How do you do that? By pushing down?
122:17:46|C|Eng|Charlie, they don't lock.
122:17:47|T|CDR|No, it doesn't arm . They don't lock.
122:17:59|T|CDR|Okay.
122:18:03|C|Eng|Okay, if you can't get that out there -
122:18:05|T|CDR|Houston; number 14.
122:18:06|C|Eng|- just leave the sunshade down.
122:18:10|T|CDR|Okay, 4, 3, 2, 1, -
122:18:35|T|CDR|Okay; Number 15, Houston.

122:18:41|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1 -
122:18:54|C|Eng|Charlie, I guess we'd just like you to leave the sunshade alone; just let it hang there.
122:19:01|T|LMP|I got it. It was wrapped around a couple of times. I didn't touch little bit, or disturb level. It's okay.
122:19:07|C|Eng|Okay.
122:19:14|T|LMP|Wait a minute, John. Okay.

122:20:08|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire. Okay.
122:20:26|C|Eng|And, Charlie, while you're taking the pictures and all, verify the area around the Central Station is policed up.
122:20:37|T|LMP|Okay, I will.
122:20:40|T|CDR|Number 18, Houston.
122:20:48|T|CDR|4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:20:58|C|Eng|And we're still getting good signals.
122:21:05|T|CDR|Okay. Coming up on the last one. And I see the black thing ; skipping that one. Going up here by the Central Station. Going to fire it at the white line next to the first geophone.
122:21:27|C|Eng|Okay, and, after you fire this one, we'd like you to stand still until we give you the Go.
122:21:35|T|CDR|All right.
122:21:36|T|LMP|Wait a minute, John. Okay. Go ahead.
122:21:41|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Last one. 4, 3, 2, 1, Fire.
122:22:18|C|Eng|Okay. You can go.
122:22:19|T|CDR|Houston, you got to be kidding. Okay. Was the signal reverberating that long?
122:22:28|C|Eng|Right. It really rings down.
122:22:40|T|LMP|All finished . Good show. Tony, ain't there some way we can fix that heat flow?
122:22:48|C|Eng|Looks pretty bad there, Charlie. We suggest you just not worry about it there. You've got a good ALSEP, and the other experiments are working fine.
122:23:02|T|LMP|Well - All those hours .
122:23:04|T|LMP|Okay. We got all the pictures except for the ones John's supposed to take of the mortar package . And I'm skipping the heat flow ones. And we're up to magazine - We're 102 on - 101 on magazine Alfa.
122:23:33|C|Eng|Okay.
122:23:41|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to get the hockey stick, John.
122:23:47|T|CDR|Okay. I'm going to - Gotta switch 5 clockwise here to safe the beast.
122:23:55|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. Do you have that pin in John's suit yet?
122:24:00|T|LMP|I'm going to get it right now.
122:24:02|C|Eng|Okay.
122:24:07|T|LMP|Coming your way.
122:24:08|C|Eng|Rog. Seeing you coming.
122:24:13|T|LMP|What's the heart rate when I'm going like this, Tony?
122:24:16|T|CDR|About 10.
122:24:19|C|Eng|Okay, you're going about 110 right now.
122:24:24|T|LMP|Am I? Thank you.
122:24:27|T|CDR|Well, what's mine?
122:24:32|C|Eng|John, you're about 80.
122:24:36|T|CDR|That figures.
122:24:41|T|LMP|See that right there, Tony?
122:24:44|C|Eng|Yep, sure do.
122:24:49|T|CDR|Okay, the old Central Station is all cleaned up.
122:24:53|C|Eng|Good job.
122:24:54|T|CDR|All the junk is gone somewheres.
122:24:57|T|LMP|Did you see what I held just in front of the camera, Tony?
122:25:00|C|Eng|Yeah, we sure did.
122:25:04|T|LMP|It was a solid piece of glass - spherical - and part of it's broken away, but it really most unique piece of glass I've ever seen in all the samples. I think.
122:25:33|T|LMP|No, it's a solid piece of glass!
122:25:37|C|Eng|Fantastic.
122:25:42|T|LMP|And it was right out here by the drill.
122:25:51|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I'm going to deploy this -
122:25:54|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute. Let me get this thing in, and I'll go back and start on that heat flow. I mean the - Can you step away so I don't get these cables?
122:26:05|T|CDR|What is it you want to do?
122:26:07|T|LMP|I got to get this in.
122:26:08|T|CDR|Oh. Gosh, it is it, isn't it? Can you see it?
122:26:17|T|LMP|Yeah.
122:26:23|T|CDR|How did I do it is what I'd like to know.
122:26:27|T|CDR|Manual dexterity test of the year. I'll bet -
122:26:33|T|LMP|Okay, it's in.
122:26:37|T|LMP|Probably.
122:26:38|T|CDR|I'll bet you 100 dollars.
122:26:39|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. That is back in on the Commander.
122:26:42|C|Eng|Good show.
122:26:48|T|LMP|These Rover tracks are amazing. They're just barely -
122:27:25|T|CDR|Gah.
122:27:56|C|Eng|Outstanding, John.
122:28:00|T|CDR|And for the geophones to be in the same line , it'll have to go with a Sun angle of 333.
122:28:10|C|Eng|Okay.
122:28:24|T|CDR|I mean the thumper package. Excuse me.
122:28:34|T|LMP|Boy, that beauty almost didn't want to come loose, Tony. But we got it.
122:28:56|C|Eng|Charlie, what was the cap on the bottom end? We missed that.
122:29:02|T|LMP|Baker.
122:29:04|C|Eng|Okay.
122:29:08|C|Eng|Outstanding.
122:29:36|T|LMP|Okay - Delta and Baker on the bottom .
122:29:55|T|LMP|We're losing a little bit out of the third section here. get the cap on. And Echo is on the bottom of the third section. Over.
122:30:18|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
122:30:25|T|LMP|Man, the trick of the week getting this wrench off of here.
122:30:37|T|LMP|Am I in focus right here, Tony?
122:30:39|C|Eng|Yeah, you look fine.
122:30:43|T|LMP|That's amazing. That camera is so good.
122:30:51|C|Eng|The lens must be like a pinhole camera.
122:31:08|T|CDR|And I'm unable to get one of the legs of the mortar package deployed here for some reason.
122:31:27|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Do you want me to save the drill?
122:31:30|C|Eng|Yeah, why don't you just leave it setting there?
122:31:35|T|LMP|In case you guys come up with something? Okay. Boy, am I filthy.
122:32:36|T|LMP|Okay, John, I'm going to start configuring over here for some geology.
122:32:41|T|CDR|Okay.
122:32:42|T|LMP|And I'll -
122:32:43|T|CDR|Be there as soon as I can, Charlie.
122:32:44|T|LMP|- put your bags on and et cetera, et cetera.
122:32:57|T|CDR|Houston, I can see why I can't deploy this third leg, but I can't seem to do anything about it. Would you take two out of three legs?
122:33:07|T|LMP|You want me to come help, John?
122:33:09|T|CDR|Well, Charlie, it's a question - I can't get this pin around this angle in here. I mean, I don't know how it got the way it is, but unless I got it around the angle, it won't deploy.
122:33:27|C|Eng|Which leg was it, John?
122:33:32|T|CDR|The third leg on the mortar pallet. Will you take three out of four?
122:33:41|C|Eng|Well, if it won't come out, I guess we're stuck with it.
122:33:47|T|CDR|Well, I don't see any way with my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="alsj">gloves</a>. If I took my gloves off, I could get it out, but I ain't going that far.
122:33:55|C|Eng|Okay, we'll just go with three, John.
122:34:03|T|LMP|Sure I can't help, John?
122:34:04|T|CDR|No, there's nothing you can do. Unless we could pull it, it won't come out. And there is no way to pull it without a - Hmm, pair of pliers. Without a screwdriver.
122:34:22|T|LMP|Well, we ain't got one of those.
122:34:24|T|CDR|No. Three out of four will work.
122:34:28|T|LMP|By golly, they ought to be satisfied with that. - go with that.
122:34:30|C|Eng|Yes, John, we're satisfied with three. Let's just go with that.
122:34:35|T|CDR|Okay.
122:34:44|T|CDR|And going in the ground at 333.
122:36:16|T|CDR|Okay. The mortar pallet is in and flat; and the level is still - No. Shoot, it's now about 330.
122:36:43|C|Eng|Okay, John.
122:37:02|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm going to get a couple of grab samples out here in front of the Rover about 15 feet. look like typical rocks that are in this area. One of them's - They're mostly dust covered here, but I can pick up a couple that are whitish, and I'll get a couple of cross-Suns before .
122:37:28|C|Eng|Sounds good, Charlie.
122:37:58|T|CDR|Okay. The mortar package is in place. Oh, dear.
122:38:14|T|CDR|The mortar package - The pallet is level. The mortar package is not quite level; it 's just off the edge of being level.
122:38:21|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. The bubble is free of the case, though?
122:38:26|T|CDR|Yeah, it is.
122:38:28|C|Eng|That's fine, then
122:38:29|T|CDR|Reasonably enough. Okay. I'm going to raise the radio antenna . Red flag.
122:40:01|T|CDR|Okay, the red flag's up.
122:40:37|C|Eng|Charlie, you might want to slow down a little bit.
122:40:53|C|Eng|Okay.
122:40:55|T|CDR|I can't believe how full of holes this place is. Just general comment. You got the camera, Charlie?
122:41:02|T|LMP|No, it's on the Central Station.
122:41:03|T|CDR|Oh yeah. I remember the last time we put it on the Central Station , the thing collapsed. I figured you left it over at the car.
122:41:15|T|LMP|Okay, bag 351, Tony, has got a grab sample.
122:41:24|C|Eng|Okay, and, John, after -
122:41:26|T|LMP|And, I wouldn't even take an &quot;after&quot; for you. You'll never -
122:41:30|C|Eng|After taking pictures of the mortar package there -
122:41:32|T|CDR|Two seconds.
122:41:32|C|Eng|- we would like a picture of that last thump imprint.
122:41:38|T|CDR|All righty.
122:41:42|C|Eng|I'm sorry, Charlie. Go ahead.
122:41:43|T|LMP|Ah, my first rock!
122:41:45|T|CDR|Houston -
122:42:39|T|CDR|Charlie, this camera here is kind of dusty.
122:42:42|T|LMP|Well, I think it's just the outside.
122:42:45|T|CDR|I looked at the lens; it looks clean.
122:42:47|T|LMP|Yeah. Check this one.
122:43:31|T|CDR|You want a stereopair?
122:43:32|C|Eng|That'd be fine.
122:43:37|T|LMP|
122:43:38|T|CDR|You okay?
122:43:41|T|LMP|. Ah, the old orange juice went down wrong.
122:44:14|T|CDR|Boy!
122:44:15|T|LMP|Tony, I'm going over to this crater and get you some of this white soil. I think it is coming off of this rock here, but it looks like caliche. I never thought I'd use that word up here; but that's what the coating looks like.  It's right here.
122:44:34|T|CDR|Let me see that.
122:44:49|T|CDR|Where did you see it?
122:44:51|T|LMP|See it? Right there?
122:44:53|T|CDR|Yeah.
122:44:58|T|LMP|Oh, we've had a bag failure, already. That thing. The little pull-tab came off; we can still use them, though.
122:45:09|T|LMP|Here, hold this for me.
122:45:13|T|CDR|Okay. Charlie, you got my camera?
122:45:15|T|LMP|Yeah, and it's filthy. Get a little shovelful of that stuff.
122:45:25|T|CDR|Gosh, Charlie, it does look like caliche.
122:45:27|T|LMP|Doesn't it look like caliche?
122:45:28|T|CDR|Yeah, but it's just a bunch of white frags. I believe.
122:45:33|T|LMP|I'm going to get this rock here, too.
122:45:36|T|CDR|Put that in there?
122:45:37|T|LMP|No, go ahead. I'll get another bag for that.
122:45:40|T|CDR|I'm really ill-equipped to help you here.
122:45:50|T|CDR|Okay, that sample of white material is going in bag 355, Houston.
122:45:55|C|Eng|Okay, bag 355.
122:46:13|T|CDR|Charlie, what are you doing with the dirt? You just threw it all over yourself.
122:46:17|T|LMP|I didn't mean to; the rock fell out.
122:46:20|T|CDR|You got to clean off your lens - my lens - before we can start here.
122:46:23|T|LMP|No, I cleaned it off already.
122:46:25|T|CDR|Okay.
122:46:28|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. It's a white matrix in this rock with some clasts. It's a one-rock breccia. One of the clasts just fell out. But it really looks like a caliche matrix. Sort of friable.
122:46:49|T|CDR|Come on, Charlie.
122:46:50|T|LMP|What do you mean, &quot;Come on?&quot;
122:46:53|T|CDR|Oh. What do you want to do with these samples?
122:46:56|T|LMP|Put them in this HTC right here .
122:46:58|T|CDR|Okay. This number 2 one?
122:47:00|T|LMP|Yeah. That's the one that's going on somebody's back.
122:47:04|T|CDR|Okay. It's got the core tubes in it, so it probably goes on your back.
122:47:13|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The geology config here.
122:47:20|T|LMP|How are we doing on the timeline, Tony?
122:47:21|C|Eng|Okay. You're just about right on.
122:47:28|T|LMP|Okay. This white rock that I picked up is in bag 373.
122:47:33|C|Eng|Okay, 373.
122:47:39|T|LMP|It really works when you spin them up, Tony; it's great!
122:47:52|T|LMP|Okay, John. I got to change the mag on my camera. Can you give it to me?
122:48:00|T|CDR|Affirmative.
122:48:04|T|LMP|What are you going to do, clean me off? Or clean off the LCRU?
122:48:07|T|CDR|Naw; I gonna clean up the camera. Wait a second; let me put this down. Down right here.
122:48:12|T|CDR|Okay. I wanted to clean the camera off, too.
122:48:25|T|CDR|Get that dust out of there, or we'll never get the mags in.
122:48:33|T|CDR|Okay?
122:48:35|T|LMP|Okay, thanks. How about cleaning yours off too. Yours I got really filthy -
122:48:38|T|CDR|Did you change your mag on it?
122:48:40|T|LMP|Huh? No. Just dust it off.
122:48:45|T|LMP|Can you get my gloves a minute, John?
122:48:47|T|CDR|Can I get your gloves?
122:48:48|T|LMP|Just clean them a minute.
122:48:52|T|LMP|There you go. Just to get that loose stuff off.
122:48:54|T|CDR|Okay.
122:48:57|T|LMP|Okay, that's good. Thank you.  Okay, Tony. Magazine Alfa is going out with 110.
122:49:11|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
122:49:12|T|CDR|Oh, man.
122:49:16|T|LMP|Dust is everywhere, John.
122:49:21|T|CDR|That's what they say, all right.
122:49:30|C|Eng|Okay, Golf, 2.
122:49:31|T|CDR|Not a bit on the lens, though.
122:49:32|T|LMP|I know it.
122:49:35|T|CDR|Fantastic.
122:49:50|T|LMP|Okay, Golf runs.
122:49:52|C|Eng|Okay.
122:49:53|T|LMP|Everything's looking good.
122:49:54|C|Eng|Very good.
122:50:06|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, which Bag do you want?
122:50:10|T|LMP|I got to get - There's a set of bags over here .
122:50:16|T|LMP|I'll get them - They're already - I got to load you up.
122:50:19|T|CDR|Okay. Did you get these cap dispensers. We don't need those, do we?
122:50:24|T|LMP|I put them in there. I think we got two core tubes.
122:50:29|T|CDR|That big rock right there is a breccia - look at all those clasts in there.
122:50:33|T|LMP|I know it. Most of them in here are breccias.
122:50:34|T|CDR|Yeah.
122:50:40|T|LMP|I picked up one - Yeah, that's a - uh-huh - about a two-rock breccia there.  Okay, I see you on this side.
122:51:11|C|Eng|Okay.
122:51:12|T|CDR|Oh, man! Look at that.
122:51:13|T|LMP|What? Look at what?
122:51:17|T|CDR|Come here and help me get this bag up here.
122:51:19|T|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you wanted me to look at something.  It would be easier to do that without the -
122:51:30|T|LMP|Yeah, I fell down. Sorry.
122:51:36|T|CDR|I believe it.
122:51:37|T|LMP|I'm filthy, huh?
122:51:39|T|CDR|Yeah. Can you bend over very much?
122:51:48|T|CDR|We got to walk - just away a little here, so I can bend over without bumping into the Rover - .
122:52:17|T|LMP|That's what I tried to do, and that's when I fell down.
122:52:20|T|CDR|Oh.
122:52:23|T|LMP|Let's see, the area is pretty well policed up over there . When I come back to get the core tubes , I'll pick it up.
122:52:35|T|LMP|There's a good place to do the Grand Prix out here. You'll pole vault yourself right over to Stone.
122:52:44|C|Eng|Okay, understand.
122:52:47|T|LMP|Tony, looking up-Sun towards the eastern part of Stone Mountain, you cannot see those lineations, but, as we look across-Sun, those lineations are there -
122:53:00|T|CDR|Can you bend over some, Charlie?
122:53:03|T|LMP|Yeah.  And they trend sort of upslope to the northwest, or to the -
122:53:09|T|CDR|Okay.
122:53:10|T|LMP|Got it?
122:53:11|T|CDR|Got you.
122:53:12|T|LMP|Okay.
122:53:17|C|Eng|Yeah, it's funny. It trends the same as Hadley.
122:53:22|T|LMP|Yeah, it does exactly! And it goes right up over the ridge - a ridge line - and back down the ridge -the one that's got Cinco craters on it - and then back down into the ridge where -
122:53:39|T|CDR|Boy, Charlie, it looks like we could just - Smoky and Stone Mountain look like they're 10 feet away from us.
122:53:44|T|LMP|I know it. You'd just run right over there.
123:53:52|T|LMP|The thing wouldn't stay on a minute ago; now it won't come off.
122:53:55|T|CDR|Now, you can't get it off.
122:54:02|T|LMP|Maybe if I unlock it. That might be the problem.
122:54:15|T|LMP|Turn around.
122:54:17|T|CDR|Which way?
122:54:18|T|LMP|To your right.
122:54:20|T|LMP|Other right. There you go.
122:54:21|T|LMP|No, you're right.  Okay, now bend over.
122:55:24|T|LMP|Okay, I got the strap. Stand by.  Just a moment.
122:55:04|T|LMP|Ah ha!  Okay. You got it.
122:55:13|T|CDR|Okay.
122:55:15|T|LMP|Let's go.
122:55:16|T|CDR|Do it.
122:55:18|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, our heading was 195. Hasn't changed.
122:55:23|C|Eng|Good show.
122:55:24|T|LMP|We're mounting up.
122:55:25|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like a full set of readouts here; and we'd also like to verify that you have the front drive on bus A. Drive Power.
122:55:39|T|CDR|Front Drive is on bus A and - Yeah, I changed that back a while back.
122:55:46|C|Eng|Rog.
122:55:53|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to Mode switch 1. Will that mess you up on getting this front-drive stuff?
122:56:01|C|Eng|No, that's okay.
122:56:03|T|CDR|Houston, we're going to Mode 1. Okay? Okay?
122:56:05|C|Eng|Okay.
122:56:10|T|CDR|Okay, do y'all want to be checked with before we do that, or you just want to go ahead and do it?  You ready to go, Charlie?
122:56:38|T|LMP|Not yet.
122:56:43|T|CDR|- there.
122:56:45|C|Eng|Okay, John. Our best guess is a heading of 274 for the first leg; 0.7 kilometers should take you past Buster there and just north of Spook.
122:56:58|T|CDR|Okay.
122:57:14|T|LMP|Okay, babe. Here I come, the old Rover for the first time. Oops.
122:57:30|T|LMP|Man, am I sitting up in the air! Did you get your seat belt done? John?
122:57:46|T|CDR|Yeah. Got it hooked to something, Charlie.
122:57:52|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute.
122:57:56|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. You want the readings, right?
122:58:00|C|Eng|Right.
122:58:02|T|CDR|Or do you? We got 118 ampere-hours, batteries are up to 90 and 90 . The forward and rear motor temps are off-scale low; amps are zero; and the volts are 68. And we're on our way.
122:58:23|C|Eng|Outstanding. Do you now have the Nav and range.
122:58:32|T|CDR|Suppose we do. Okay. 033 is the bearing; the range is one-tenth.
122:58:44|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
122:58:45|T|CDR|Hasn't changed any, has it ?
122:59:08|T|LMP|And it's going to be a piece of cake taking pictures from here, Tony.
122:59:12|T|LMP|There's a big crater. There's about 10-meter off to your left there, John.
122:59:15|T|CDR|I see it, but -
122:59:17|T|LMP|A deepy one over here. Four clicks an hour Tony and -
122:59:25|T|CDR|Charlie, you hit my arm.
122:59:26|T|LMP|Excuse me.
122:59:28|T|CDR|I'll end up in that big crater. Oh, man!
122:59:32|T|LMP|Okay at 043 and 0.2, just beyond the ALSEP, there are two twin craters. The biggest one's to the north. It's got blocks in it, up to 50 centimeters, and it's about 5 meters deep.
122:59:50|T|CDR|Say again what your best guess is to this thing?
122:59:53|C|Eng|A heading of 274.
122:59:57|T|CDR|274, huh?
123:00:00|T|LMP|Now one thing I can't do is see the maps.
123:00:02|C|Eng|Okay, I'm not sure that heading is good. That was based on an earlier estimate of where ALSEP was, and your bearing now may make that wrong. It's pretty much if you go west you are going to hit Spook.
123:00:17|T|CDR|That's what we're doing, going west. I'm not sure that's not it right there, Charlie.
123:00:25|T|LMP|Where?
123:00:26|T|CDR|Right there. That couldn't be it, could it?
123:00:37|C|Eng|Right. Only way.
123:01:32|T|LMP|Tony, we seem to be riding across a ridge top that trends east-west. Off to the left, it drops off drastically, about maybe a 5-to-10-degree slope into a valley which is probably Hidden Valley.
123:01:40|C|Eng|Very good.
123:01:43|T|LMP|And South Ray Crater is <I>spectacular</I> in our 10 o'clock position; and we're 072 at 0.3 now.
123:01:54|C|Eng|Do you have a speed amp?
123:02:00|T|LMP|Huh?
123:02:03|T|CDR|What did he say?
123:02:04|T|LMP|I don't know.
123:02:05|C|Eng|Could we have the speed and the amps?
123:02:09|T|LMP|Okay, you're 5 -
123:02:15|T|CDR|We got to go around this, Charlie.
123:02:16|T|LMP|Yeah, you're 5 kilometers an hour, and the amps are oscillating about - between 10 and 20.
123:02:24|C|Eng|Okay.
123:02:36|T|LMP|How's it driving, John? Pretty easy?
123:02:38|T|CDR|Darn good.
123:02:40|T|LMP|Hey, man. We could just go, babe. I'm really cinched into this moose.
123:02:48|T|LMP|This <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="alsj">seatbelt</a> is great. It seems to be taking it with no problem. We are at 6 kilometers an hour now, Tony, 0.4 , still nothing new to report. Maybe more cobbles in this area now. In fact, there are. The regolith is more cobbly in appearance, still angular. Maybe 40 percent of the surface is covered with cobbles that are 10 centimeters .
123:03:20|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
123:03:21|T|CDR|Look at that one.
123:03:27|C|Eng|And we're right on the timeline.
123:03:28|T|LMP|We see some small fresh craters, meter size, that show some very fresh - at least - Perhaps it's indurated regolith. That's what it looks like, because the little hard clods are the same inside the craters as on the rim.
123:03:57|C|Eng|Okay.
123:04:00|T|LMP|At our 11 o'clock position, we're at 089 for 0.4. We have two very bright, small craters that are 2 or 3 meters across, and we see some whitish material down below in the walls of the crater there. They're about 25 meters off.
123:04:23|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. Those rocks that you collected , were they - Were they all breccias, or could you tell ?
123:04:29|T|CDR|Charlie, you hit my arm.
123:04:32|T|LMP|I'm not sure, Tony. I think they were breccias, but they were really dust covered, so I couldn't tell you, really.
123:04:40|C|Eng|Okay, understand. And have you seen any rocks that you're certain aren't breccias?
123:04:50|T|CDR|Quit hitting my arm!
123:04:54|T|LMP|Negative. I haven't seen any that I'm convinced is not a breccia.
123:04:58|C|Eng|Okay.
123:05:03|T|LMP|Okay. We're going generally west now, and at our 1 o'clock position on a heading of 270 at a bearing - We're 091 at 0.5 ; we're in another distinct ray field - ray pat - 'Ray', let's say, 'boulder field'. We sort of passed out of one, and we're in another one. And we're getting the - Go ahead, John.
123:05:31|T|CDR|Think that to the south of us is Spook?
123:05:36|T|LMP|It could be.
123:05:41|C|Eng|Right. You should be just about to Spook.
123:05:42|T|LMP|No, Spook's about - Let's see. At 0.6 we should be at Spook, huh? Let's see. Spook is at 100 at 0.9 . Not there yet. We're only 0.6, Tony.
123:06:00|T|LMP|Okay. This ray field has the same pebbles and cobbles and some good secondaries here.
123:06:13|C|Eng|Right. That summary you got there, Charlie, -
123:06:15|T|LMP|John's just doing great driving this moose.
123:06:17|C|Eng|- is the point by Buster; you should be coming up to the edge of Spook. The eastern edge of it.
123:06:28|T|LMP|Okay. Turn left, John, and let's go look down over there. Boy, Tony, there is some excellent little secondaries with the indurated regolith in 'em and on the rim. The biggest one is a couple of meters.
123:06:44|C|Eng|Very good.
123:06:50|T|LMP|You know that might have been Spook right back there. That was a pretty big crater.
123:06:56|T|CDR|It sure was.
123:06:57|T|LMP|Right back there, John. Boy, it's really hard . There's an interesting rock. A layered , really dust covered, like a regolith - I mean a - Turn left, John. There's a crater over there, a big one.
123:07:20|T|LMP|That's it. That's got to be . And Buster's right over here, with some blocks around it, to my right.
123:07:27|C|Eng|Outstanding.
123:07:28|T|LMP|Boy, that is a biggie. Okay, here is Spook; and it's 089 at 0.7.
123:07:36|C|Eng|Okay.
123:07:38|T|LMP|And that is a biggie!
123:07:41|T|CDR|We're not - We're looking - We're almost completely past it; we're not right even with it. Where'd you say Buster is?
123:07:48|T|LMP|I thought it was right over here, John.
123:07:51|C|Eng|Is the rim of Spook rocky?
123:07:52|T|LMP|Right straight ahead here. Negative, it's real subdued, Tony.
123:08:01|C|Eng|Okay, do you see any ledges or anything in the inside of Spook?
123:08:21|C|Eng|Okay, good show.
123:08:24|T|LMP|With some frags that we'll be able to get off. The biggest boulder's a meter - cobbles. It's real good for raking here. Here it is, John. That's it, Buster, there it is. Okay, in Buster, Tony, I can see some HUGE boulders in the bottom of that thing! Man, John!
123:08:45|T|CDR|That is a big crater.
123:08:49|T|LMP|How big is Buster, Tony?
123:08:51|T|CDR|40 meters .
123:08:53|C|Eng|About 40 meters.
123:08:54|T|LMP|That's bigger than Buster.
123:08:56|T|CDR|That's Buster. 50 meters. It's 150 feet, Charlie.
123:09:01|T|LMP|Okay. That's Buster, then.
123:09:03|T|CDR|Yep, sure is.
123:09:04|T|LMP|And, Tony, we've got some 5-meter boulders in the bottom of it. Some real big ones. The biggest, 5 meters, and the whole bottom is covered; we're going downslope now.
123:09:19|C|Eng|Okay, there should be a scarp around there someplace.
123:09:20|T|LMP|That's going to be great , Tony. We'll be at - Okay, we see it. Over to the our 2 o'clock position, and it looks like the rim of a crater, but I think it's a scarp.
123:09:36|T|CDR|What's the heading from here to - Oh, man.
123:09:41|T|LMP|Okay, we want to head - Just keep going west.
123:09:44|T|CDR|26 something, Charlie.
123:09:46|T|LMP|we want to get 100 degrees at about point - That's Station 2. Wait a minute; we want 96 at 1.5 about 280. I'm about to freeze. I have to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">turn my water down</a>. Okay, Tony. Most of the rocks that we've seen look breccias to me. We're making good time at about 7 kilometers an hour. Off to the right, what I thought was a scarp turned out to be a crater on the side of a ridge that runs east-west.
123:10:25|T|CDR|Driving down-Sun in zero phase is murder.
123:10:27|T|LMP|It is, isn't it?
123:10:29|T|CDR|It's really bad.
123:10:33|T|LMP|We're out to 089 at 1.0, Tony.
123:10:36|C|Eng|Okay.
123:10:39|T|LMP|And you're making great time, though.
123:10:42|T|LMP|Okay, and in this area, the regolith is real smooth. The cobble population is distinctly smaller and we're - Eek!
123:10:56|T|LMP|I hope that's Spook . How big is Spook, 300 meters? There it is, there's the Buster; I mean, there's Flag. We're here! You did it!
123:11:06|T|CDR|It sure is, isn't it?
123:11:07|T|LMP|We are here!
123:11:08|C|Eng|Well, congratulations.
123:11:09|T|LMP|Okay, 088 at 1.0 is - Okay, we stop, John, about 40 meters from Plum.
123:11:23|T|CDR|Okay, now, I don't see Plum.
123:11:24|T|LMP|There it is, right there.
123:11:26|T|CDR|That's Plum?
123:11:28|T|LMP|Yeah!
123:11:30|T|CDR|That ain't even on the rim.
123:11:32|T|LMP|Well, it is; it's - Yeah, it is. It's right - We're - The rim is right here. We're on top of the rim.
123:11:39|T|CDR|Okay.
123:11:40|T|LMP|Hey, stop. It's going to be terrible walking on this thing. Why don't we go turn around and go back up on the rim where it's level?
123:11:49|T|CDR|Suits me.
123:11:53|T|LMP|This is a steep slope here. Okay, Tony. It didn't seem like there was that much distance between  300 meters is Flag. That's not 300 meters. Is that 300 meters right there?
123:12:14|T|CDR|Charlie, you got me. I can't tell.
123:12:18|C|Eng|Okay. Could we have another range and bearing, please?
123:12:24|T|CDR|Okay. 087 at 1.1.
123:12:36|T|LMP|Well, that's a big crater anyway.
123:12:38|T|CDR|Yeah, it looks to me like we're due north of South Ray Crater right now. I can look down there, and I feel like I'm bisecting it. No, we're not due north of it, not according to shadow.
123:12:50|T|LMP|Get the map out here.
123:13:09|T|CDR|Okay, let's get off and start working.
123:13:14|T|LMP|Okay, it was 0.6 between Buster and - That's got to be Buster.
123:13:24|T|CDR|Back there, huh? That -
123:13:34|T|LMP|That - Okay -
123:13:35|T|CDR|That's a 40-meter crater.
123:13:36|T|LMP|Over here?
123:13:37|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:13:38|T|LMP|Yeah; that's what I'm thinking.
123:13:39|T|CDR|It'll do - Let's not waste any more time thinking about it.
123:13:48|T|CDR|Let me park the thing -
123:13:50|T|LMP|Okay.
123:13:51|T|CDR|- heading south . You want to get off?
123:13:52|T|LMP|No, go ahead.
123:13:57|C|Eng|Okay. And -
123:14:03|T|LMP|It has all the characteristics . We must have landed -
123:14:08|T|CDR|-
123:14:19|T|CDR|You bet.
123:14:28|T|LMP|I tell you, when you go to get on this thing , you better turn your cooling down or you'll freeze.
123:14:31|T|CDR|Yeah, I should have gone to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Minimum cooling</a>.
123:14:33|T|LMP|Me too.
123:14:34|T|CDR|I forgot all about it. Okay.
123:14:40|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. What we've got here is a - We think we're - Plum Crater is sitting right on the outer rim of Flag. And it's what appears to me to be 200 meter - Pretty big crater we call Flag, and this is an identical spot for -
123:15:12|T|LMP|Another big one right back here - - See that big one back up there that we called - This might be Halfway, this one right here.
123:15:20|C|Eng|All right, our -
123:15:22|T|CDR|This one here?
123:15:23|T|LMP|Yeah, this one right here.
123:15:25|C|Eng|Our measurements say that -
123:15:26|T|LMP|Say again.
123:15:27|C|Eng|- you should be pretty near Halfway.
123:15:31|T|CDR|Okay, why don't we get back and try some more, Charlie?
123:15:34|T|LMP|Okay, I agree.
123:15:42|T|LMP|What?
123:15:44|T|CDR|Pulled out the thing. Get that for me, Charlie?
123:15:51|T|LMP|Yeah.
123:15:59|T|CDR|I know what it is; every time I put the -
123:16:03|T|LMP|Belt on, huh?
123:16:04|T|CDR|Belt on tighten down the belt, it pulls my -
123:16:09|T|LMP|Can you push against me?
123:16:10|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:16:11|T|LMP|No, wait. Just stand up. Let me get downslope, and you get upslope.
123:16:17|T|CDR|Okay; be careful. Backing up.
123:16:27|T|LMP|You're moving away from me. Can you prevent that? Okay, it's back in.
123:16:49|T|LMP|Man, it all looks the same, doesn't it?
123:16:52|T|CDR|Sure does.
123:17:32|C|Eng|Okay. It looks like Plum Crater would be almost due west of you about 200 meters.
123:17:42|T|LMP|Okay. I'm hooked, John. Roger.
123:17:54|T|CDR|Well, I'm not.
123:17:55|T|LMP|You're twisted a little bit. Turn it clockwise, counter-clockwise. Other way. There you go.
123:18:02|C|Eng|I'd loop around <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Halfway</a> to the south.
123:18:03|T|LMP|That got it.
123:18:05|T|CDR|That's what we're doing.
123:18:07|T|LMP|I think that's what we're doing. We got a little depth-size problem here and I think we'll figure it out here in a little bit.
123:18:19|C|Eng|Very good. Understand.
123:18:24|T|LMP|Halfway, with a smaller one on the side.
123:18:37|C|Eng|Rog.
123:18:39|T|LMP|I tell you that is a bigger crater than that, though.
123:18:44|T|CDR|Okay.
123:18:55|C|Eng|Okay.
123:19:04|T|LMP|Can you go to the right, John? There's a pretty fresh batch, dead ahead. That's about a tenth of a kilometer across there, though; that's a big crater right there.
123:19:21|T|CDR|Yeah, I don't think it's a 300 meterer .
123:19:35|T|LMP|I feel real faith in this thing ; open her up a little bit.
123:19:42|T|CDR|I can't see where I'm going, Charlie.
123:19:49|T|LMP|Here we go. Okay, Tony, we left that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-c.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Halfway</a>, and we're now en route to - Halfway and Buster looked about the same size. Is that right according to y'all's calculations?
123:20:03|C|Eng|That's right, Charlie.
123:20:04|T|CDR|That's right, Charlie. Halfway -
123:20:05|C|Eng|That's just about right.
123:20:09|T|LMP|Okay. Well, that's what that was. That was Halfway.
123:20:13|C|Eng|Okay.
123:20:14|T|LMP|John, it takes those little bumps - Oh, it won't take that one; but it'll take those little ones just great.
123:20:47|T|CDR|Yeah, it's clearing up.
123:20:51|T|LMP|And now we're - There's another ray we're coming in out of South Ray, which definitely out of South Ray, you can see it trending right on in to South Ray.
123:21:00|C|Eng|Outstanding.
123:21:06|T|CDR|Yeah, that's that big South-Ray-Crater ray, down here, I think.
123:21:13|C|Eng|Right.
123:21:15|T|LMP|You can see Hidden Valley. You can see partially into Stubby. The Cinco Craters are very visible up there on the side .
123:20:25|C|Eng|Is there any albedo difference -
123:20:25|T|LMP|Got to go back right, John, to get - .
123:20:27|T|CDR|I know it.
123:20:27|C|Eng|- when you're in a ray or just the cobbles and boulders ?
123:20:25|T|CDR|No, it's albedo.
123:21:37|T|LMP|There is no mistake in your mind when you're in a ray because of the blocks.
123:21:42|C|Eng|Okay.
123:21:43|T|LMP|And the surface is a little bit lighter - the regolith. Blocks are very angular.
123:21:53|T|CDR|I'd like to sort of tack. I can see a lot better. Just a little north or a little south.
123:21:59|C|Eng|Do you see both the white and the black and white , here?
123:22:05|T|LMP|It's mostly gray, Tony, with a - There's a big crater over there, John.
123:22:10|T|CDR|That's it.
123:22:12|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:22:13|T|LMP|We're coming into the south of Plum.
123:22:19|T|LMP|Okay, this is probably Plum right over here - No, I guess not. Plum is 40 meters; that's not nearly 40 meters.
123:22:32|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I think we finally found Spook, here. Or Flag, rather.
123:22:36|C|Eng|Okay, did you notice that scarp that's mapped, that you should have driven across?
123:22:43|T|LMP|No, didn't see it. It's all hilly and scarpy here.
123:22:49|C|Eng|Okay, do you notice a trend to the scarps?  they all seem to be northeast.
123:22:57|T|LMP|Yeah, that's probably pretty close, northeast. Okay, that's got to be it, John. But I don't see Plum. Unless this is it right here.
123:23:13|T|CDR|This is it, Charlie.
123:23:15|T|LMP|We are on the rim of it.
123:23:16|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:23:18|T|LMP|Okay, we got to park on the other side about 40 meters up. Do a 180 left. Well, Tony, we finally found it at 087 and 1.4.
123:23:29|C|Eng|Good show. That's where it should be.
123:23:34|T|LMP|Okay. You guys had us mapped just right then.
123:23:38|T|CDR|Man, you can't believe this territory.
123:23:44|T|LMP|It's all up and down. We're gonna be a little close here , John, but that's okay.
123:24:02|C|Eng|Okay.
123:24:08|T|LMP|Okay, your readings are 180, 088, 2.0, 1.4, 115, 115, 115. Amps are zero. Volts are 68, 68, 100, 100. Rear motor s off-scale low; forward motors off-scale low.
123:24:30|C|Eng|Okay, we copy. You should be about 40 meters from Plum. Is that right?
123:24:36|T|LMP|No, we're not. We're right on the rim, if that's okay with you.
123:24:41|C|Eng|That's okay.
123:24:42|T|LMP|You can - You can -
123:24:43|T|CDR|You'll be able to see everything we do.
123:24:44|C|Eng|Okay.
123:24:46|T|LMP|Okay. For some reason, I'm not bouncing out of this thing like I thought I would.
123:24:49|C|Eng|Are you still in the ray material there at Plum?
123:24:55|T|LMP|No.
123:24:57|C|Eng|Good. We don't want to be.
123:25:00|T|LMP|The ray material is about 50 meters to the east of us, Tony.
123:25:06|C|Eng|Outstanding.
123:25:49|T|LMP|I can't even see the bottom right where we are.
123:25:57|T|CDR|That is spectacular.
123:26:00|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The sides are steep enough to cast a shadow from the Sun, so you can estimate from what our Sun angle is what the walls of that are.
123:26:15|C|Eng|Okay.
123:26:21|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. To the north side of Spook, right on the - I keep calling it Spook - on Flag is a crater right on the inner rim, that has some blocks in it that are not too big, cobble size , I'd say.
123:26:40|T|CDR|That help any, Houston?
123:26:43|C|Eng|We don't have a picture yet.
123:26:46|T|LMP|And -
123:26:48|T|CDR|Mode switch is in 2.
123:26:51|C|Eng|Charlie, don't fall in that thing.
123:26:53|T|LMP|I'm not gonna fall in it.
123:27:05|T|LMP|Boy, anybody that judges Cayley Plains as a flatland is crazy.  Tony, the sides of this thing get pretty steep. I'm not going to get down too far, I can't see the bottom of it. And it's getting so steep I don't want to go any farther.  Okay, Tony -
123:27:34|C|Eng|Sounds like a good idea, Charlie.
123:28:15|C|Eng|Okay, how far down from the rim are you?
123:28:18|T|LMP|Hey, John - - Halfway.
123:28:23|C|Eng|Okay.
123:28:28|T|LMP|Okay; rake soil coming up.
123:28:30|T|CDR|Okay.
123:28:32|T|LMP|And that's done up on Flag.  We can do some sampling and radial along Flag.
123:28:44|T|LMP|Oh, there's a great place for the rake, see, right up there?
123:28:48|T|CDR|Yeah, we don't even -
123:28:50|T|LMP|12 o'clock?
123:28:52|T|CDR|Yup.
123:28:54|T|LMP|Okay, I got the rake. Let's see, that's all I need. I can shovel with this .
123:28:57|C|Eng|Our big eye is alive.
123:28:58|T|CDR|Okay; let's go.
123:29:02|T|LMP|Ah so, here we go!
123:29:11|T|LMP|Okay, we're going up to where it's more cobbly, Tony, to get the rake sample. It's pretty smooth right here.
123:29:18|C|Eng|Okay, the rake sample should be one crater diameter away from Plum. And it doesn't have to be -
123:29:24|T|CDR|From Plum?
123:29:25|C|Eng|Right. And it doesn't have to be too cobbly there.
123:29:29|T|CDR|Okay, well -
123:29:34|T|LMP|This is about it then, John.
123:29:35|T|CDR|Yeah, but I don't think any of - The rocks from here may have come from Plum, but they may be some other place, too.
123:29:42|T|LMP|Well, let's do what they want us to do.
123:29:45|T|CDR|All right.
123:29:47|C|Eng|Right; the intent was to get other things than Plum right there -
123:29:49|T|LMP|How about right out there, in my shadow?  There's some right there. That might be -
123:29:55|T|CDR|Sure going to get them.
123:30:03|T|CDR|Right here, Charlie?
123:30:05|T|LMP|Yeah, that's fine.
123:30:08|C|Eng|And, John, when you get a chance -
123:30:09|T|LMP|Okay, an eleven footer at 11.
123:30:10|C|Eng|- could we get a frame count from you?
123:30:16|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, I'm at 50, magazine Bravo.
123:30:20|C|Eng|Okay.
123:30:22|T|CDR|Okay, I'm at 10, magazine Bravo.  Charlie, you're standing in the shadow.
123:30:32|T|LMP|Sorry, I'm moving. Man, it's so easy to get around up here.
123:30:38|T|CDR|Okay, let's do it.
123:30:43|T|LMP|And we'll start the old rake, for the first time! Get that beauty right there. Look at it come through that regolith, would you?
123:30:56|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston. We'd like for you to check your primary water valve -
123:31:00|T|LMP|Go ahead.
123:31:02|C|Eng|Make sure it's open.
123:31:08|T|LMP|Okay, I'll let John check it. I'm feeling good. Nice and cool. Can you check it?
123:31:15|T|CDR|Yeah. Wait a minute.
123:31:18|T|LMP|I'm not sure it was all the way open.
123:31:28|T|CDR|Yeah, it's open, Charlie; it's all the way open.
123:31:33|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
123:31:35|T|CDR|Houston; it's open all the way.
123:31:38|T|LMP|Yeah, I feel good cooling, Tony.  Move out and let's get around out of the way there. Another rake. Okay, Tony, we got about -
123:31:58|T|CDR|Okay.
123:31:59|T|LMP|Already?! Is that right?
123:32:04|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
123:32:06|T|LMP|Go to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Min cooling</a>. Okay, if y'all been expecting it.
123:32:19|T|CDR|All the way up is Min, isn't it, Houston?
123:32:21|T|LMP|Yeah. Wait a minute; I'm losing all of those .
123:32:26|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:32:27|T|LMP|There's three little ones.
123:32:30|T|CDR|Two little ones, now.
123:32:36|T|CDR|Okay, we better get another one.
123:32:38|T|LMP|Yup.
123:32:54|T|LMP|There's a pretty good -
123:32:55|T|CDR|
123:32:57|T|LMP|John, there's a glassy one right there. I can't tell what the other ones are.
123:33:02|T|CDR|I can't either. They're all dust coated. Do you want me to go low or high or what?
123:33:07|T|LMP|No, that's fine.
123:33:10|T|CDR|Okay.
123:33:16|T|CDR|373.
123:33:18|T|LMP|372.
123:33:20|T|CDR|372.
123:33:22|T|LMP|372 with three rakes . Over.
123:33:24|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. 372.
123:33:30|T|LMP|And there were more smaller ones but they fell through the tines.
123:33:38|C|Eng|Okay, we copy. I take it the soil isn't too cohesive here.
123:33:46|T|CDR|Charlie, hold the bag for a second.
123:33:50|T|LMP|No, they're just small !.
123:33:51|C|Eng|Rog.
123:33:55|T|LMP|If we'd picked another place -  I can't get the top off.
123:34:01|T|CDR|That's right.
123:34:02|T|LM Crew|-
123:34:05|T|CDR|Yeah, I got it.
123:34:06|T|LMP|Okay.
123:34:16|T|LMP|Okay, John, if you'll step aside, I'll get a soil sample.
123:34:23|T|LMP|Okay, there's the tone, Tony.
123:34:27|C|Eng|Okay.
123:34:29|T|CDR|Want me to get your Aux water On? Want me to get it, Charlie?
123:34:33|T|LMP|Aux. I got it.  Aux water is On.
123:34:36|C|Eng|Okay.
123:34:43|T|LMP|Hey, how much soil, Tony?
123:34:45|T|CDR|Kilo.
123:34:46|T|LMP|Kilo, huh. That's what I thought.
123:34:48|C|Eng|That's right. One kilo.
123:34:56|T|CDR|Yeah. A little one.
123:34:59|T|LMP|Okay. Ahh. rock.
123:35:06|T|CDR|-  Almost looks like - .
123:35:09|T|LMP|- soil. Okay. Man, it's really soft here, Tony, on the rims . You don't sink far, but when you walk on it, it gets very -
123:35:23|T|CDR|That's the last time I do that with soil.
123:35:25|T|LMP|When you rake it -  Did it come out? The Z-ing, you mean? Look at that gnomon already, would you? Look at the color chart.
123:35:35|T|CDR|Dropped the dirt all over it.  We'll just have to be more careful.
123:35:39|T|CDR|Okay, this is 354. Going in bag 354, Houston.
123:35:44|C|Eng|Okay, 354.
123:35:49|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, is the feedwater pressure coming back up again?
123:35:53|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
123:35:58|T|LMP|Okay; I don't feel it.
123:36:00|T|LMP|We ought to start from here, John, and do a radial sampling in towards Plum.
123:36:04|T|CDR|Okay.
123:36:05|T|LMP|Okay, why don't you go ahead and get started and I go get the shovel. Okay?
123:36:08|T|CDR|All right.
123:36:17|T|LMP|Tony, I went to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Minimum on my cooling</a>.
123:36:19|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
123:36:23|T|LMP|Hey, was that about what time you expected or am I using it faster than normal?
123:36:30|C|Eng|Ah, you're using it just a hair faster. We'll probably take a couple minutes off the EVA, but it's nothing real bad.
123:36:39|T|LMP|Okay, I feel like what happened is that I've been on a little bit more than <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">minimum cooling</a>.
123:36:52|T|LMP|About pushed the Rover over, do this.
123:37:12|T|CDR|-
123:37:14|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston.  We don't want you to stay in Min cooling if you need more cooling than that. You don't really buy anything, you just stow it and have to pay it off later.
123:37:25|T|LMP|Understand. Understand. I was just telling you what the circumstances were.
123:37:30|C|Eng|Okay.
123:37:36|T|LMP|Thank you for the reminder.
123:37:45|T|CDR|Charlie, that's as good as any of them.
123:37:47|T|LMP|It looks like it is gonna come apart, though, to me.
123:37:52|T|CDR|It might. There's three or four samples right there we can get.
123:37:57|T|LMP|I'm just trying to turn my feedwater on a little bit.  I'll get these in the shovel.
123:38:02|T|CDR|Okay.
123:38:04|T|LMP|If you don't get out of that - If you don't get that thing in the -
123:38:16|C|Eng|Okay, are all of these rocks looking pretty much the same?
123:38:21|T|LMP|They're all covered, Tony.
123:38:22|T|CDR|All dust covered.
123:38:25|C|Eng|Okay.
123:38:27|T|LMP|Dust.
123:38:31|T|CDR|What do you need, Charlie?
123:38:32|T|LMP|Bag.
123:38:34|T|CDR|Okay.
123:38:35|T|LMP|one.
123:38:41|T|CDR|They're angular.
123:38:43|T|LMP|All angular, though, I'll tell you that. Here's one with a white streak, looks like a caliche streak through it.  believe it. It's that white rock.
123:39:05|T|LMP|Okay, there are four samples, John. That's good enough.
123:39:08|T|CDR|Yeah. That's in bag 371, Houston.
123:39:11|C|Eng|Okay; 371.
123:39:28|T|CDR|Okay.   put this in your bag.
123:39:34|T|LMP|Okay; come on over.
123:39:46|T|LMP|Man, that crater - That is really something. Tony, on the west side of Flag, there is a small crater maybe 2 to 3 meters across; it's real fresh, has some real bright rays, and you can see a blocky interior. Wait a minute, John, just let me shoot - I can - There you go.
123:40:07|C|Eng|We copy that, Charlie.
123:40:10|T|LMP|Okay. And that's about a third of the way down from the rim. Wish we could see the bottom .
123:40:17|T|CDR|That 's going in bag 363, Houston. 363.
123:40:21|C|Eng|Okay, 363.
123:40:26|T|CDR|Let me get an &quot;after&quot; of that, Charlie.
123:40:29|T|LMP|Okay, I'll move.
123:40:31|T|CDR|I'll have to get it from the other side.
123:40:41|T|CDR|Okay.
123:40:45|T|LMP|Okay. Here's one right here, John, that'll make a good one. See that one right there by that footprint? That's a good sample size. About 5 centimeters across?
123:41:02|T|CDR|That one right?
123:41:04|T|LMP|No, that one right here to the right of my shadow. See, right there. Let me show you.
123:41:10|T|CDR|Okay.  Right there.
123:41:12|T|LMP|Right here. See?
123:41:16|T|LMP|Okay.  It's an angular subangular rock, Houston, 5 centimeters . I can see some white clast shining through it.
123:41:30|T|CDR|Bet it's dust covered again.
123:41:32|T|LMP|Everything here is dust covered, yeah.  Got that beauty.
123:41:45|T|CDR|Wait a minute  Okay, Charlie.
123:41:59|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, it's a white matrix; it's a breccia, it looks like.  white clasts with some greenish-looking, very small millimeter-sized phenocryst in a black matrix.
123:42:15|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
123:42:16|T|CDR|Okay; it's going in bag 364, Houston.
123:42:18|C|Eng|Okay, 364.
123:42:31|T|CDR|Okay. Let me .  you going to get soil sample?
123:42:34|T|LMP|Yeah, wait a minute. Let me bounce out of the way here. Uh-oh, John. Fell out.
123:42:42|T|CDR|You're bouncing too high.
123:42:43|T|LMP|Oh. Did you close it
123:42:44|T|CDR|I'll get it. No. I didn't close the top.
123:42:46|T|LMP|Oh.
123:42:48|T|CDR|And I didn't stuff it down in there.
123:43:06|T|LMP|I gotcha. Got it. Two-man job.
123:43:11|T|CDR|Yeah.  - step, huh?
123:43:15|T|LMP|Yeah. Man it - Tony, it's really spongy here. The regolith is just real loose and non-compacted if that's the - &quot;Unconsolidated&quot; is the word I'm searching for.
123:43:29|C|Eng|All right; we copy.
123:43:30|C|Eng|Can you see where the TV is pointed?
123:43:35|T|LMP|Yes. It's pointed down towards South Ray.
123:43:38|C|Eng|Right. Over to the right on the edge of Plum there, looks like there might be rock with some phenocrysts in it. If you're over that way, you might look around and see if you see something like that. It may have just been dust on it.
123:43:52|T|LMP|Okay, there's a big rock that I've already described. Did you get the &quot;after&quot; there, John.
123:43:59|T|CDR|Yeah, I got the after. You want to - Let's get a soil sample.
123:44:02|T|LMP|Okay, coming up.  Bags are a pain, aren't they?  Okay.
123:44:24|T|CDR|It's going in bag 356, Houston. Soil sample.
123:44:31|C|Eng|Okay, 356.
123:44:45|T|LMP|Okay.
123:44:52|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm on frame count now 24.
123:45:02|T|LMP|Okay, there's one right on the rim we can get.
123:45:06|T|CDR|Okay.
123:45:07|T|LMP|There's a good size one right over here by my footprint. Actually, I took pan 1 where pan 2 should have been. Okay, looking down into Plum, Tony, there is some cobbles and things on the inner rim. But they aren't very large, maybe 30 centimeters or so is the biggest.
123:45:30|T|LMP|Yeah, that's great. That definitely's a breccia right there, John.
123:45:34|T|CDR|Yeah, you can see the clasts in it.
123:45:35|T|LMP|Yeah.  I forgot - I even forgot the locator on that last one.
123:45:41|T|CDR|Now, wait a minute, I - I didn't get that thing -  right.
123:45:47|T|LMP|That's the way that thing - That color chart is so covered with dust, it won't matter anyway.
123:45:52|T|CDR|I know. I'll have it - I'll clean it off.
123:46:09|T|CDR|How we doing on time, Tony?
123:46:10|C|Eng|Okay, you've got about 23 minutes left, here.
123:46:15|T|LMP|Twenty-three! Hum.
123:46:19|C|Eng|Rog.
123:46:21|T|LMP|By golly. We can pick up a lot of rocks in 23 - Hey, I'd like to go to the other side, John, of Plum because those rocks over there aren't dust covered, if you can see them.
123:46:32|T|CDR|That's a good idea, Charlie.
123:46:34|T|LMP|See right out there towards South Ray?
123:46:36|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:46:37|T|LMP|Those rocks don't look as dust covered as these.
123:46:48|T|LMP|Uh-oh. Agh. I missed. Wait a minute.
123:46:53|C|Eng|Nice juggling!
123:46:56|T|LMP|Well, it wasn't dust covered.  Well, we missed it. But things really fly up here. I'm amazed.
123:47:07|C|Eng|You guys sure have dirty hands.
123:47:09|T|CDR|Well, my first guess is it is a breccia with white clast in it. And I see lineations all along it - in the breccia.  It's a white-clast breccia is what it is. I see no other clasts in it. Of course, once you get the dirt off of it might all be white. At first cut, it would be a white-clast breccia. Going into 362.
123:47:59|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. And when you're through with this site, you can press on around Plum if you like.
123:48:08|T|LMP|Okay, we'd like to. There is a big boulder over there, and there are some blocks that are sitting out and aren't filleted. We'd like to try over there. See what's there.
123:48:19|C|Eng|Okay, use your discretion. You've got some time.
123:48:20|T|LMP|Here, John, why don't you grab one of mine. That crummy thing -
123:48:33|T|CDR|Okay, those are big clasts, aren't they?
123:48:36|T|LMP|Yeah. See. See that glass right there, on the top?
123:48:39|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:48:45|T|LMP|Okay; Tony, the general terrain here is sloping off to the southwest - Correction - Yeah, southwest at about 1 to 2 degrees. And Plum - Excuse me. Flag Crater is about to the top of this big ridge that slopes off generally to the southwest to the west of South Ray. Over.
123:49:15|C|Eng|Okay -
123:49:16|T|CDR|rock bag -
123:49:16|C|Eng|- on the boulders you see around there, do they have fillets and, if so, are they built up on any particular side?
123:49:26|T|CDR|That's rock bag 352, Houston.
123:49:29|C|Eng|Okay, 352.
123:49:36|T|CDR|I take it back; that's rock bag number 2.
123:49:42|C|Eng|Okay; number 2.
123:49:44|T|LMP|Come on. Stick her in; let's go.
123:49:50|T|CDR|Okay.
123:49:51|T|LMP|Man, are we -
123:49:52|T|CDR|Want some soil?
123:49:53|T|LMP|- Is it dark in those shadows. Want to get an &quot;after&quot; there, John? And I'll get a - Get it?
123:50:00|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:50:17|T|LMP|There you go.
123:50:23|T|CDR|Okay, that soil sample's in bag 369. Houston.
123:50:27|C|Eng|Okay, 369.
123:50:29|T|CDR|369.
123:50:30|C|Eng|Rog.
123:50:33|T|CDR|Charlie, you're gonna fall down here with all these rocks .
123:50:37|T|LMP|No. I'll give you the shovel in just a minute when I fill up, and we'll swap.
123:50:42|T|CDR|Okay.
123:50:44|T|LMP|This shovel is a great tool, I'll tell you.
123:50:49|T|LMP|Ah, boy. And here comes the Bobbsey Twins.
123:50:53|C|Eng|You guys look like you're having a ball.
123:50:54|T|CDR|
123:50:57|T|LMP|We are.
123:50:58|T|CDR|It really is fun.
123:51:10|T|CDR|Well, take your old thing and do an exploratory there for a while.
123:51:16|T|LMP|- suggest that.
123:51:18|T|CDR|Oh, if it's -
123:51:21|T|LMP|Look! Look at that. Come over here.
123:51:24|T|CDR|Yeah.
123:51:26|T|LMP|Look at that.
123:51:27|T|CDR|Give me the shovel.
123:51:28|C|Eng|How about doing a skim right here?
123:51:29|T|LMP|I just want you to look here.  Okay, the top - John, I had a perfect view .
123:51:39|C|Eng|Okay, I guess we'd just like a scoop here and no skim.
123:51:40|T|CDR|You know, Charlie's right. Everywhere -  Okay -
123:51:45|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, let me describe what it is. The top centimeter of the regolith is gray, and you get down under that, and it's white.
123:51:58|C|Eng|Roger; we copy that.
123:51:59|T|LMP|It's a lot different albedo ; three shades different .
123:52:04|T|CDR|You ought to be able to see that in the TV right there, Houston.
123:52:06|C|Eng|Right, we can.
123:52:09|T|LMP|I'll dig you a little trench here.
123:52:13|T|LMP|Boy, that's going to be a hard job, John.  Can you see that, Houston? We'll sample right there and get you a scoopful of this underlying regolith.
123:52:28|C|Eng|Okay, I guess -
123:52:30|T|LMP|It really is a different albedo; it's amazing.
123:52:33|C|Eng|Right; we can see that here.
123:52:34|C|Eng|Why don't you go ahead and get a bag of the dark and a bag of the light, and then we'll press on to that block on the northwest side .
123:52:42|T|LMP|All right.
123:52:47|C|Eng|Boy, my kids don't get as dirty as you are.
123:52:52|T|LMP|Well, I bet they don't have as much fun, either.
123:52:58|C|Eng|I bet you're right!
123:53:00|T|CDR|It sure is neat here.
123:53:05|T|LMP|Okay; let me get a shovelful of this, right off the top here.
123:53:10|T|CDR|Okay.
123:53:11|T|LMP|There we go.
123:53:14|T|LMP|Ah, look at that finger. Picked that up with one finger!
123:53:18|C|Eng|Ah, the delicate touch.
123:53:19|T|CDR|Wait a minute, Charlie. I've got to get the bag out.
123:53:22|T|LMP|John, we're going to have to change that bag dispenser. That is terrible.
123:53:25|T|CDR|Is there another one? Do we have another one?
123:53:27|T|LMP|Yeah, we have another one under my seat.
123:53:39|T|LMP|Okay?
123:53:40|T|CDR|Okay. That top scoop is going in bag 352, Houston.
123:53:44|C|Eng|Okay, 352.
123:54:08|T|LMP|Try to get way down there, John, and get a -
123:54:19|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
123:54:20|T|CDR|Uh-oh, what?
123:54:21|T|LMP|I just - I had a good scoopful, and I lost it. Let me dig out another little -
123:54:41|T|LMP|There.
123:54:54|T|LMP|There she be. Coming up all white.
123:55:06|T|LMP|That's all that's in there, John.
123:55:11|T|CDR|Okay. And it's going into bag 357.
123:55:13|C|Eng|Okay, 357. You fellows are really packing them away there.
123:55:31|T|LMP|Okay.
123:55:32|T|CDR|How do you feel, Charlie?
123:55:36|T|LMP|Tony, I can't get a &quot;locator&quot;. You know, we're right on the rim of -
123:55:41|C|Eng|We've located it on TV, so we have it.
123:55:41|T|LMP|- Plum   All right.  Okay; we're going over to the big boulder.
123:55:57|C|Eng|Good show.
123:56:26|T|LMP|Man, you can't see anything down-Sun, down phase, John. Tony, looking -
123:56:31|T|CDR|That's what I was trying to tell you , Charlie.
123:56:53|C|Eng|Okay, you don't see any sharp scarps or anything like that, though?
123:57:00|T|LMP|No, sir.
123:57:01|T|CDR|No, no; nothing like on that map .
123:57:03|C|Eng|All right.
123:57:04|T|CDR|Although, it's worse. Boy, I'll tell you. There's holes that - Especially in zero phase.
123:57:19|T|LMP|Well, I'm out of water. Drinking water, that is.
123:57:23|T|CDR|Well, okay.
123:57:26|T|LMP|Hey, John, you want to try just a piece of that?
123:57:29|T|CDR|Look at that, Charlie!
123:57:31|T|LMP|What's that?
123:57:32|T|CDR|That thing has greenish-black clasts in it. Right there in that boulder, there?
123:57:40|T|LMP|Looks like it to me, too, yeah. Let's see if we can get a piece of that.
123:57:44|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, this is a subrounded boulder that's a meter to a meter and a half across. It has a predominant fracture set of 20 centimeters on the side that run, here, southeast - correction - southwest/northeast. Is the predominant fracture set.
123:58:05|C|Eng|Okay.
123:58:06|T|LMP|And it's partially buried.
123:58:11|T|CDR|-
123:58:56|C|Eng|Here we go.
123:58:58|T|LMP|Going to do it.
123:58:59|T|LMP|There's a piece. Let me hold you down a little bit.
123:59:05|T|LMP|Hot dog! He did it. It's a very friable rock, apparently, Houston.
123:59:20|T|CDR|Charlie, don't do that, let me do it.
123:59:22|T|LMP|I got it leaning on the shovel.
123:59:29|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, it's got some green clasts, some white clasts, a grayish matrix. The clasts are millimeter size and make up 5 percent of the rock.  One big crystal, 5 millimeters across, but I can't tell what it is. But it's a beauty.
123:59:58|C|Eng|Okay; you think they're still breccia?
124:00:59|T|CDR|think its a breccia, Charlie?
124:00:05|T|LMP|I'm not sure, John, I think it might be - Yeah, I think it's a breccia, really. Very friable.
124:00:13|T|CDR|Yeah, it's a breccia, Houston.
124:00:15|T|LMP|Yeah, uh-huh.
124:00:17|T|CDR|Or a welded -  No, that's not right. It's a breccia, and I can see at least - Like Charlie said, there are two or three different type clasts in it. It's just a one-stage breccia, though, it looks like. It's going into bag 353.
124:00:36|C|Eng|Okay, 353; and you've got about -
124:00:37|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, here's a -
124:00:39|C|Eng|- 9 minutes until you have to leave.
124:00:45|T|LMP|All right. We'd like to go out and get one of those sharp rocks and a soil sample here.
124:00:51|C|Eng|Okay, sounds good. And while you're taking pictures there, can you take some pictures of the lineations on the ground you talked about?
124:01:00|T|LMP|Yeah, I'll do that when I get to the right spot.
124:01:02|C|Eng|Okay.
124:01:05|T|LMP|Okay, I'm taking a soil sample of the fillet around this rock.
124:01:09|C|Eng|Okay.
124:01:11|T|LMP|Boulder. John, you just whacked that beauty right off of there!
124:01:19|T|CDR|Like you say, it's friable. Ha, ha. I hit it on a fracture set, too.
124:01:24|T|LMP|Yeah.  Can't turn the shovel that way.
124:01:28|T|CDR|368 this stuff is going into, Houston.
124:01:31|C|Eng|Okay, 368 the soil.
124:01:35|T|LMP|Okay, I'll get the &quot;after&quot; on that, John. Okay?
124:01:39|T|CDR|Charlie's getting the &quot;after&quot; on that soil in 368.
124:01:44|T|LMP|Got it.
124:01:45|C|Eng|If you have time, can we do a second pan from here?
124:01:50|T|CDR|Yeah, I'm supposed to do that, ain't I?
124:01:53|T|LMP|Yeah, I was just thinking about that. That'd be a good idea. We're right on the rim of -  We're really right on the rim - This rock's right on the rim of both Plum and Flag.
124:02:17|T|LMP|Okay, John, I'm going to go over here and get some of these lineations -
124:02:21|T|CDR|Okay.
124:02:46|C|Eng|Rog. I think you're probably right, but it makes a good study.
124:03:01|T|LMP|John, you are just beautiful. That is the most beautiful sight.
124:03:07|T|CDR|What's that?
124:03:08|T|LMP|You standing there on the rim of that crater.
124:03:09|C|Eng|Doggone. I've never heard John described as beautiful.
124:03:11|T|CDR|
124:03:12|T|LMP|No.  Well, he's not really - Well, actually, he is on this thing; I'll tell you.
124:03:28|T|CDR|Okay.
124:03:50|C|Eng|Okay -
124:03:51|C|Eng|- We're going to have to hustle you on pretty soon, so you better grab those angular rocks.
124:03:59|T|LMP|Okay.
124:04:00|T|CDR|That pan takes me through frame 53.
124:04:03|C|Eng|Okay; 53.
124:04:08|T|LMP|Tony, I'll document this one - while John's coming over - with the scoop, in place, is the gnomon.
124:04:15|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
124:04:24|C|Eng|Boy, that TV sure makes this fun.
124:04:26|T|CDR|And we really make good time around here.
124:04:29|T|LMP|Yeah.
124:04:36|T|CDR|Did you get that biggie, Charlie?
124:04:38|T|LMP|That one right there is what I'm gonna get. Think it will go in the bag?
124:04:41|T|CDR|No.
124:04:48|T|LMP|This is a great way to do it, leaning on this shovel. Ahhh.
124:04:53|T|LMP|It might go in the bag, John.
124:04:55|T|CDR|Nah, Charlie.
124:04:56|T|LMP|Huh?
124:04:57|T|CDR|Let's not even try it.
124:05:11|C|Eng|Okay, and it's time to go back and pack up.
124:05:16|T|LMP|Okay.  Argh! I see what you mean, babe.
124:05:21|T|CDR|Hey, you can't get the top off.
124:05:23|T|LMP|Can't get the top off. Now I just pull it off of your thing, there.
124:05:33|T|LMP|Okay, I figured I was going to do that.
124:06:05|T|CDR|Can't believe that terrain, Houston.
124:06:09|T|LMP|Here you go, John. Why don't you carry it back? -
124:06:12|C|Eng|You're right. That's pretty spectacular.
124:06:13|T|LMP|
124:06:14|T|CDR|Let's just lay it in the seat.
124:06:23|T|LMP|Here we come!
124:06:24|C|Eng|Okay, we see you.
124:06:26|T|LMP|Ready or not.
124:06:26|T|CDR|Uh-oh, here's
124:06:27|C|Eng|We're ready.
124:06:31|T|LMP|Boy! How did that come out?
124:06:32|T|CDR|I don't know.
124:06:51|T|LMP|Ah!
124:06:56|T|LMP|Have you got everything?
124:06:57|T|CDR|Yeah.
124:06:58|T|LMP|Give me some. I can carry something. Okay, it's in there. It's not in your pocket. There it goes.
124:07:11|T|LMP|Times flies.
124:07:20|T|LMP|Man, I can't wait to get back to Buster, Tony.
124:07:23|C|Eng|Right.
124:07:28|T|LMP|It's really some crater.
124:07:30|C|Eng|As you come around there, there is a rock in the near field on this rim that has some white on the top of it. We'd like you to pick it up as a grab sample.
124:07:39|T|LMP|This one right here?
124:07:41|C|Eng|That's it.
124:07:44|T|LMP|This one right here?
124:07:45|C|Eng|That's it.  You got it, right there.
124:07:49|T|LMP|Okay, that's a -
124:07:50|T|CDR|That's a football-size rock.
124:07:52|T|LMP|It's a &quot;Great Scott&quot; size.
124:07:56|T|CDR|Are you sure you want a rock that big, Houston?
124:08:03|T|CDR|That's 20 pounds of rock right there.
124:08:05|T|LMP|Okay.
124:08:09|T|LMP|It's got some big clasts in it, John.
124:08:13|T|CDR|It sure has.
124:08:27|T|LMP|Agh!
124:08:37|C|Eng|We agree.
124:08:39|T|LMP|Okay; I've got it! That's 20 pounds of rock!
124:08:48|T|CDR|You want to put it in here, Charlie? I'd just as soon you didn't. Look at the size of that moose!
124:08:53|T|LMP|I know it.  Oh, Tony! It's got some beautiful crystals in it though. That was a good guess.
124:09:02|C|Eng|Good show.
124:09:07|T|LMP|Okay, put it in there, John.
124:09:10|T|CDR|Put it in where?
124:09:11|T|LMP|In your SCB.
124:09:13|T|CDR|I don't think it'll fit.  Don't think it will fit.
124:09:23|T|LMP|It ain't gonna fit.
124:09:27|T|CDR|Put it under your seat.
124:09:30|T|LMP|Yeah. Kind of dusty. Whew! Hey, do you want some more bags here?
124:09:38|T|CDR|Yeah.
124:09:40|T|LMP|Okay, here's your a good one.
124:09:43|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm gonna put that little glass ball that I haven't sacked yet - Look at that, John.
124:09:52|T|CDR|Yeah, it is a good piece of glass.
124:09:53|T|LMP|Solid glass.
124:09:55|T|CDR|Black glass.
124:09:57|T|LMP|Going into bag 4.
124:10:15|C|Eng|Okay; and we'll need an EMU check before you drive off.
124:10:25|T|LMP|Stand by.
124:10:27|T|CDR|Okay, I'm running at 48 percent ; 3.87 . I'm on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">halfway between Intermediate and Minimum </a> and I didn't have any flags.  We got to do something with this bag before we can leave, Charlie.
124:10:43|T|LMP|Put it under your seat. Or under my seat.
124:10:47|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm clear on the flags. My frame count is 65. I've got - Hmm.
124:11:14|T|CDR|What you got, Charlie?
124:11:17|T|LMP|Looks like I'm at about 35 percent, and I'm between Intermediate and Min; and I'm at 3.85.
124:11:29|C|Eng|Okay.
124:11:30|T|CDR|Yeah, make sure you're in Min I guess, before we get in and start driving.
124:11:35|T|LMP|Yeah. Going to Min. That's a good point. Thanks.
124:11:40|T|CDR|Okay.
124:11:42|T|LMP|Leaps. Single bound.
124:11:46|T|CDR|MODE switch is going to 1, Houston.
124:11:49|C|Eng|Okay.
124:11:53|T|CDR|I'm going to position your TV horizontal and CCW , which it almost is.  It is. You saved me a lot of work there.
124:12:21|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
124:12:23|T|CDR|What's the matter, Charlie?
124:12:24|T|LMP|Oh, my seatbelt came off my ring. Can you get it for me, John?
124:12:26|T|CDR|Yeah.
124:12:28|T|LMP|Will you get in -
124:12:30|T|CDR|I couldn't see it - Oh, there it is. Let me get it for you.
124:12:33|T|LMP|I'll do it. I think.
124:12:38|T|CDR|Yeah, you got it.
124:12:41|T|LMP|Okay.  Boy, this is a nice belt.
124:12:54|T|CDR|Okay, we're in Mode switch 1; and the TV off stowed.  Can you see my pin over there, Charlie?
124:13:11|T|LMP|Can I see what?
124:13:15|T|CDR|Can you see whether I'm about to pull out my pin or not?
124:13:24|T|LMP|Pull up your - ?
124:13:26|T|CDR|Pull out my pin.
124:13:27|T|LMP|Oh, I can't see. No, it doesn't look like it.  Man, are we filthy!
124:14:05|T|CDR|Okay.
124:14:07|T|LMP|Okay.
124:14:08|T|CDR|-
124:14:10|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we're just about underway.
124:14:18|T|CDR|Okay; we're going to follow our footsteps back.
124:14:21|T|LMP|Okay, that's a good idea.  Tony, did you read?
124:14:29|C|Eng|Yeah, we sure did.
124:14:30|T|CDR|
124:14:31|C|Eng|Okay, and we're looking at -
124:14:45|C|Eng|And if you get there in time, we'll have John go ahead, as nominal, and do the LPM . And then we'll end the LPM site measurement. And Charlie, you can do your 500-millimeter near the edge of Spook, and do a pan near the rim of Spook. And run over and do a couple of samples of Buster if you have time left. And that'll be our Station 2.
124:15:09|T|LMP|Okay, why the cutback?
124:15:17|C|Eng|Okay; it's your water consumption there, Charlie.
124:15:23|T|LMP|Ah, rats! Okay.
124:15:25|C|Eng|That's all right. You're getting some really good geology there. Don't feel bad.
124:15:39|T|LMP|Okay; we're making good time going back, and it's easier going up-Sun. You can see the craters a lot better. The characteristics of the regolith are the same.
124:15:52|T|CDR|Are you using the 16 , Charlie?
124:15:55|T|LMP|No.
124:16:00|T|CDR|Well, it ain't easier for me. If I wasn't following these tracks, it would be bad. Up-Sun or down-Sun, it's bad for driving.
124:16:06|C|Eng|Roger. We figured it probably would be.
124:16:09|T|LMP|You're making great time, John. We're doing 11 clicks.
124:16:13|C|Eng|Outstanding!
124:16:14|T|LMP|Super!
124:16:15|C|Eng|The Grand Prix driver is at it again.
124:16:22|T|CDR|I can follow a road.
124:16:25|C|Eng|Back to the on-off switch mode.
124:16:30|T|LMP|
124:16:30|C|Eng|John, did you dust that TV lens?
124:16:35|T|CDR|I dusted it somewhere.
124:16:38|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
124:16:40|T|CDR|I don't remember if it was that station or not.
124:16:47|C|Eng|Okay, I guess we'll need it dusted again at this next stop.
124:16:52|T|CDR|All righty.
124:16:56|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. As I look up-Sun here, going back through , you can see these lineations, mostly furrows, I'd call them, with random orientation. And they're definitely the Sun casting shadows on unconsolidated regolith.
124:17:19|C|Eng|Right.
124:17:21|T|LMP|You can't believe how up and down this is, Tony.
124:17:26|C|Eng|How about when you're driving across rays? You noticed any difference in the Rover tracks?
124:17:35|T|CDR|I notice an increase in block population. But the tracks you can't see; they're behind you.
124:17:42|C|Eng|Okay; I thought maybe you could see them behind the front wheel there.
124:17:49|T|CDR|
124:17:52|T|LMP|It's a cloud of dust, Tony.
124:17:54|C|Eng|Okay; we copy.
124:18:12|T|CDR|That's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Spook</a>, isn't it? That big one right there?
124:18:19|T|LMP|Yeah; I think it is.  That's the one we called Buster. Okay. We got to go up north if you're gonna -
124:18:32|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're in a real blocky boulder field here. It's probably thrown out from Spook. What we originally called Spook was not Spook. I think this blocky one is Spook. And we're coming up from the south side of it.
124:18:52|T|CDR|Yeah, I'd say, Houston, that I was farther past - I guess that I was farther past Double Spot -
124:19:07|T|LMP|But we got 0.8 mile , John, and Spook is supposed to be a mile from the LM, as per the map. That's got to be it right down there.
124:19:15|T|CDR|Buster?
124:19:16|T|LMP|No, that's Spook.
124:19:19|C|Eng|Okay -
124:19:20|T|CDR|
124:19:20|C|Eng|- Spook should look about the same size as Flag.
124:19:25|T|CDR|Does it look the same size?
124:19:29|T|LMP|No, this is the biggest crater right over here to the right.
124:19:32|T|CDR|Okay; well, this is Buster .
124:19:34|T|LMP|Okay, that's what I thought. It's a blocky crater.
124:19:36|T|CDR|Let's stop the Rover halfway between them?
124:19:39|T|LMP|Yeah.
124:19:40|C|Eng|No, near the edge of Spook.
124:19:41|T|LMP|Buster is a lot bigger than -  Yeah, okay, it 's about 50 meters or so. We're bearing 089 for 0.8.
124:19:54|C|Eng|Okay.
124:19:55|T|LMP|We're supposed to park 180 about halfway, John, . Don't - We're in a big hole back over here, Could you - Go forward ?
124:20:00|C|Eng|Little bit nearer to the end of Spook so we can see into Spook.
124:20:06|T|LMP|What you really want to see into is Buster. Buster is about the same size as what we called Spook here. In fact, it's a more impressive crater!
124:20:17|C|Eng|Okay, whatever turns you on, there.
124:20:19|T|LMP|John, that thing's - That, that's got to be - Tony, is there a big crater to the south of -
124:20:29|T|CDR|Spook?
124:20:30|T|LMP|Spook?
124:20:31|T|CDR|Cove is.
124:20:33|C|Eng|That'd be quite a ways. Red Rose looks about like 0.8 kilometer.
124:20:44|T|LMP|No.
124:20:52|C|Eng|All right. Let's do it right here. We concur.
124:20:59|T|LMP|Buster is a lot bigger than Plum is. The one we called Plum.
124:21:04|C|Eng|Right, it should be.
124:21:06|T|CDR|Yeah, it sure is.
124:21:10|T|LMP|Okay, then we got the right place then, if it should be. Okay, we're stopped and we're 180 , 087 , 2.8 , 0.8 , 115, 115, 72, 72, 100,100, off-scale low, off-scale low.
124:21:31|C|Eng|Okay, we copy.
124:21:52|T|LMP|Okay; pan one, up on Spook crater.
124:21:56|T|CDR|I can't believe it, Charlie.
124:22:02|T|LMP|What? You did it again?
124:22:05|T|LMP|Oh, I know it. I saw that. It was on those stanchions there. I'm sorry, I should have said something to you.
124:22:15|T|CDR|Okay; well, I won't need it . Do you need it?
124:22:17|T|LMP|No.
124:22:26|T|LMP|You're kidding!
124:22:27|T|CDR|No.
124:22:28|T|LMP|Okay, I'll put it in. Come on over. You start the LPM , and I'll be over in just a minute.
124:22:32|T|CDR|Okay, I'll get the antenna up.
124:22:36|T|LMP|Okay.
124:22:40|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. Are you on a ray there? And are the blocks angular.
124:22:48|T|LMP|The blocks are angular, but they are definitely coming out of Buster.
124:22:50|C|Eng|Okay, very good.
124:22:56|T|LMP|dissipate very quickly. In fact, they don't even come to Flag .
124:23:03|C|Eng|Okay. Hey, we've got a TV picture!
124:23:05|T|CDR|Buster is a real impressive crater.
124:23:20|T|LMP|John? Old Orion!
124:23:23|T|CDR|Where is it, Charlie?
124:23:25|T|LMP|Right - Just to the left - Right under the Sun, as a matter of fact.
124:23:29|T|CDR|By golly, we did park it in the right place!
124:23:38|T|CDR|Somebody is working the TV, and it ain't even locked up yet!
124:23:42|C|Eng|Okay, John. We'll need to press on with that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">LPM</a>, or we won't get it done.
124:23:57|T|LMP|How's your pointing from that - ?  Okay; since you don't - just do LPM, John and I'm gonna do the 500, I won't put your bag back on. Okay?
124:24:11|T|CDR|Okay.
124:24:14|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Under here, again, right under the regolith, the first centimeter or so, we have the white albedo material.
124:24:23|C|Eng|Understand.  Hey, that does a good job on the lens there.
124:24:28|T|CDR|Your eye looks clear to me here, Houston.
124:24:30|C|Eng|Yeah, that helped a lot.
124:24:38|T|CDR|And the Earth is - You should be locked up, I guess. And the Earth is boresighted in the boresight machine.
124:25:07|C|Eng|That 's a deep monster, isn't it?
124:25:08|T|LMP|How you read me, Houston?
124:25:09|C|Eng|We're copying you fine.
124:25:17|T|LMP|Doesn't sound like they're reading us.
124:25:20|T|CDR|read, wag your TV.  - , Charlie.  fix this thing for me?
124:25:35|T|LMP|Let me take these pictures.
124:25:38|T|CDR|Look, Charlie?
124:25:39|T|LMP|Huh?
124:25:40|T|CDR|I've got to do this LPM.
124:25:41|T|LMP|Okay. You don't want to go ahead and get started with that?
124:25:42|T|CDR|I want us to do it, but I -
124:25:43|T|LMP|Okay, okay, okay.
124:25:49|T|LMP|Houston, do you read? Over?
124:25:50|C|Eng|We're copying 5 by. How us?
124:25:56|T|CDR|Did you knock your Mode switch Off? Or did I knock mine Off?
124:25:58|T|LMP|We're both in AR.
124:26:05|C|Eng|John and Charlie, this is Houston. You copy?
124:26:10|T|CDR|Yeah, loud and clear. Where you been?
124:26:12|C|Eng|Well, you've been there all the time. I don't know.   Got great TV; really fine.
124:26:21|T|LMP|Okay, there it is.
124:26:26|T|CDR|What am I hung up on now, Charlie?
124:26:28|T|LMP|Okay, you got on that what-cha-ma-call-it, that -
124:26:31|T|CDR|Hangs out there?
124:26:32|T|LMP|That hangs out there. Yeah.
124:26:34|T|CDR|Okay.
124:26:49|T|CDR|Okay.
124:27:10|T|CDR|Ol' LPM.
124:27:22|T|LMP|Dadgummit.
124:28:40|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. I'm going to take a few of South Ray here, with the 500. We got a good view of it here.
124:28:53|T|CDR|Agh!
124:29:08|T|CDR|Okay, the LPM has got its sensor head on it, and the power switch is coming on Mark.
124:29:14|C|Eng|Okay.
124:29:18|T|CDR|And the temperature label says &quot;Nothin'&quot;.
124:29:20|C|Eng|All right.
124:29:20|T|CDR|All of 'em are black.
124:29:23|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the 500 millimeter's up to 50.
124:29:26|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
124:29:30|T|LMP|I guess I take a few too many. I had a triple, vertical, stereo pan on Stone Mountain, and about five frames on old South Ray. Over.
124:29:46|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
124:29:51|T|LMP|Okay, I'm finished with my pan, and the 500. I'm gonna run over to Buster and do some sampling. Over.
124:30:05|T|CDR|Buster is really an impressive crater, Houston. The walls are so darn steep, and the blocks are <i>all</i> over it.
124:30:13|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. And Charlie, sounds like you've got a good plan there.
124:30:19|T|LMP|Okay.  And if you'll notice, I'm carrying John's bag, and the shovel, and I'm not taking the gnomon.
124:30:42|T|CDR|Okay.
124:30:45|T|LMP|Man, that's gonna be a little steep ridge to climb .
124:31:07|T|LMP|You get -  Yeow whee! Man, John, I tell you, this is some sight up here, looking down into that beauty.
124:32:14|T|LMP|And -
124:32:18|T|CDR|I know, boy.
124:32:20|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, I'm back . The sensor number 1 is on there and -
124:32:26|T|CDR|Mark.
124:32:27|C|Eng|Okay; we started the clock.
124:32:33|T|LMP|Tony, if that is a secondary, that is a <i>big</i> rock that hit in there.
124:32:37|C|Eng|Rog.
124:32:38|T|LMP|The rocks down there are very fractured, though. The rocks down there are extremely fractured. You can see a major fracture set running - dipping about north 30 degrees on one rock. The other one is subhorizontal, so it's just a very impressive sight as far as the boulder goes. They're all angular. Some of them - Well, I call some of them subrounded, but the majority of them are angular. And they have a grayish texture to them and that's about all I can tell. I got a partial pan from up here on the rim. And I'm gonna start sampling.
124:33:21|C|Eng|Okay; that sounds good, Charlie. And why don't you press on sampling now?
124:33:28|C|Eng|And, it's time , John.
124:33:30|T|LMP|All right.
124:33:32|T|CDR|Okay; you going to give me -  Okay, X, 657; Y, 363; Z, 440.  X, 655; Y, 360; Z, 437.  X, 654; Y, 354; Z, 440.
124:33:57|C|Eng|We copy.
124:34:00|T|CDR|Is that okay? Did you get all that stuff, Houston?
124:34:03|C|Eng|We sure did.
124:34:06|T|CDR|Okay; we'll turn it around.
124:34:32|C|Eng|Okay, bag 5.
124:34:33|T|LMP|It's dust covered so that's all I can say about it. I got another little one, same spot; and it's got a whitish clast to it, and another little one that's got a whitish cast to the underside of it. All that in bag 5.
124:34:54|C|Eng|Okay.
124:34:09|C|Eng|And John, verify your visor's down.
124:35:15|T|CDR|Yeah, I never - I forgot to raise it.
124:35:17|C|Eng|Okay.
124:35:24|T|CDR|Thank you, Tony.
124:35:31|T|CDR|Okay; 2 is installed.
124:35:43|T|LMP|And Tony, I really think we're sampling blocks out of this -
124:35:46|T|CDR|Mark, Tony.
124:35:47|C|Eng|Okay.
124:35:54|T|CDR|Did you get that mark?
124:35:56|C|Eng|Yeah, sure did. It started the clock.
124:36:00|C|Eng|And did you get the picture of the location, there?
124:36:10|T|CDR|Okay;  do that right now. Is that okay?
124:36:15|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine.
124:36:20|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. From here is a soil sample going into bag 6.
124:36:33|T|LMP|This is on the rim of Buster.
124:36:35|C|Eng|Okay. And John, you can take a reading whenever you want.
124:36:43|T|CDR|Okay, wait a second.
124:37:04|T|CDR|Okay; Houston. That was frame count 56 on magazine Baker -
124:37:06|C|Eng|Okay.
124:37:07|T|CDR|- picture.
124:37:22|T|LMP|But it might go in the bag. How much time , Tony?
124:37:25|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're ready for the reading.
124:37:27|C|Eng|Go ahead.
124:37:30|T|CDR|114 is X, 361 is Y, 356 is Z.
124:37:39|C|Eng|Go.
124:37:42|T|CDR|116 is X, 360 is Y, 366 is Z.  116 is X, 357 is Y, 374 is Z.
124:37:58|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
124:37:59|T|CDR|Going out and turning it around.
124:38:01|T|CDR|Did you get all of that ?
124:38:03|C|Eng|Sure did. And Charlie, we'll be leaving as soon as John's finished.
124:38:11|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, there's another rock going into bag 7.
124:38:18|C|Eng|Okay; bag 7.
124:38:20|T|LMP|Dust covered.
124:38:21|T|LMP|Okay, I'm going about a quarter of a diameter away from Buster and sample some more.
124:38:27|C|Eng|Okay.
124:38:30|T|LMP|The rim of Buster is a pretty good slope, climbing up there, Tony.
124:38:49|T|CDR|Okay.
124:38:50|T|LMP|Got a cramp.
124:39:00|T|LMP|How long have we been out, Tony? I got -
124:39:04|T|CDR|I got a couple hours, Charlie.
124:39:05|T|LMP|I've got six hours.
124:39:06|C|Eng|05:45, Charlie. And I've got a Mark, John.
124:39:09|T|LMP|Okay.
124:39:11|T|CDR|Mark, Tony.
124:39:15|C|Eng|Okay.
124:39:58|T|LMP|John, the only trouble is that you can't put the bag -
124:40:00|T|LMP|- .
124:40:10|T|LMP|Agh!
124:40:13|T|CDR|X is 104; Y, 403; Z, 423.  X, 107; Y, 404; Z, 425.  X, 110; Y, 405; Z, 425.
124:40:36|C|Eng|Okay. Outstanding and visor down .
124:40:38|T|CDR|Did you get those , Houston?
124:40:40|C|Eng|Sure did.
124:40:42|T|CDR|Visor is down.
124:40:47|T|CDR|Read switch is Off, and the Power switch is Off.
124:40:52|T|LMP|is a very friable rock, and it's the most shocked rock I've ever seen; it's just pure white. The whole matrix is pure white. And it's not a breccia.
124:41:05|T|CDR|Yeah?
124:41:06|T|LMP|I hate to tell you this, but I dropped my bags.
124:41:09|T|CDR|I'll get it.
124:41:10|T|LMP|If you come - They came - Guess what happened? The little thing; I didn't - It came unlocked.
124:41:16|T|CDR|You've got to tape those.
124:41:18|T|LMP|No, not that. It was just the top thing.  This is really some rock, really shocked.
124:41:30|T|CDR|Okay, move back and let me get it on the fly, Charlie.
124:41:36|C|Eng|Okay, and as soon as you get buttoned up there, we'll be taking off.
124:41:38|T|LMP|Just beautiful.
124:41:43|T|CDR|Okay.
124:41:50|T|LMP|Tony, on this friable rock, this shocked one. It's very friable and I'm gonna try and get it in the bag but I'm not sure it's gonna go.
124:42:05|T|LMP|And if I don't get it in the bag, I don't think it's going to survive. Well, there's part of it in the bag, anyway.
124:42:10|C|Eng|That'll do fine.
124:42:12|T|LMP|It just broke in two in my hand.
124:42:15|C|Eng|Geochemists are always telling us how little rock they need.
124:42:22|T|LMP|Okay. And that's in bag number 9.
124:42:26|C|Eng|Okay; bag 9.
124:42:29|T|CDR|They're going to get a lot of nice rock samples today.
124:42:34|C|Eng|Good show. It sure sounds that way.
124:42:35|T|CDR|nice little rocks.
124:42:39|C|Eng|Sounds like a lot of rocks.
124:42:41|T|LMP|That was a real balancing act, Tony.
124:42:43|T|CDR|And if somebody cleans our suits, they can get another 5 pounds.
124:42:49|C|Eng|That's our comprehensive sample.
124:42:51|T|CDR|Now, here comes the interesting part.
124:43:05|T|LMP|Very good, John.
124:43:14|T|CDR|Ed was right, it does wind up on itself.
124:43:18|C|Eng|Yeah, Ed's sitting here chuckling.
124:43:20|T|CDR|Will it unwind on itself?  Yeah.
124:43:23|T|LMP|Look at that thing! It's like a bowl of spaghetti!
124:43:30|T|CDR|What I hope is, it doesn't end up going into the mouth of the -
124:43:46|C|Eng|Well, you're doing pretty good there, John.
124:43:51|T|CDR|Oh, yeah.
124:44:10|C|Eng|Okay, bag 10.
124:44:12|T|LMP|It's an angular rock.
124:44:19|C|Eng|Charlie, we better get you loaded back up.
124:44:21|T|CDR|I was worried about that power cab -
124:44:24|C|Eng|Say again, John.
124:44:26|T|CDR|I was worried about - On the geophone experiment -  Huh?
124:44:28|T|LMP|They want us to load up, John. I guess they're - I'm running out of water.
124:44:35|T|CDR|Okay.
124:44:38|C|Eng|John, go ahead with what you were saying.
124:44:40|T|CDR|I said - Have we got a problem of some kind? Are we needing to get Charlie back?
124:44:49|C|Eng|It's no problem. We're just trying to - You're a little bit late on this station and, to get everything in and so to get back in on time, we might be a little late.
124:45:00|T|CDR|Okay.
124:45:02|T|LMP|We understand.
124:45:03|C|Eng|Right. We are going to shorten the EVA by about 8 minutes, is all.
124:45:10|T|CDR|8 minutes!
124:45:11|T|LMP|We'll settle for that.
124:45:18|T|LMP|We got four samples and about - That sample is going into bag 11, Tony.
124:45:25|C|Eng|Okay, bag 11.
124:45:30|T|LMP|And here, Tony, I don't really see - Man, that's a sackful, John!   I don't see the high albedo stuff underneath.
124:46:02|T|LMP|Houston, I hate to tell you this, but those rocks, these light ones here, they look like caliche to me.
124:46:12|C|Eng|Well, who knows?
124:46:18|T|CDR|Okay, Houston.  We're going frame switch to 1 and CCW. You already got it in CCW? Yeah. Mode switch is going to 1, Houston.
124:46:32|C|Eng|Okay.  And could I get your final frame count?
124:46:41|T|CDR|You just got mine. I gave you the last rate count on the -
124:46:46|C|Eng|Right.
124:46:47|T|CDR|- on the LPM .
124:46:49|T|LMP|Okay, I'm -
124:47:00|T|LMP|really works great.
124:47:16|T|LMP|And the old pallet is closed. Locks right in there; look at that beauty.
124:47:24|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, check <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Minimum on the cooling</a>?
124:47:26|T|LMP|Oh, yeah. Okay, I am.  There we go. I did it that time.
124:47:45|C|Eng|And John -
124:47:46|T|LMP|
124:47:46|C|Eng|- can you check and make sure your purge valve pin's still in?
124:47:51|T|CDR|Is it in, Charlie?
124:47:57|T|LMP|Ain't no way I could tell, unless you - Yeah, it's there. Uh-huh, I saw it.
124:48:01|C|Eng|Outstanding.
124:48:03|T|LMP|Whew!   We are mounting upon the vehicle! As they say, Houston.
124:48:14|T|CDR|Okay.
124:48:15|C|Eng|That skill is awesome.
124:48:15|T|CDR|Charlie.
124:48:16|T|LMP|Okay.
124:48:20|T|LMP|Okay; I'm going to take some pictures going - Wow, is that Sun bright! Ooh! There's home. You see it?
124:48:30|T|CDR|Yeah.
124:48:32|T|LMP|John, you're not going right.  That navigation has us right on! You turn to 086, we'd be pointed right at that beauty .
124:48:42|T|CDR|Let's do that.
124:48:47|T|LMP|Look at it, John. Four more degrees and you got it! Snockered . 087 now. You're about 084 and you'd have it.
124:48:59|T|CDR|Okay.
124:49:01|T|LMP|You're gonna have that big crater!
124:49:04|T|LMP|Man, this is a fun ride.  Okay, Tony, we're doing 10 clicks.
124:49:14|C|Eng|Outstanding.
124:49:18|T|LMP|Occasionally, the back end breaks loose, but there's no problem. This is <i>really</i> some machine.
124:49:30|T|LMP|Hey, looking back up-Sun, the rays are even more pronounced. Looking up-Sun rather than down-Sun, the blocks stand out like black spires.
124:49:42|T|CDR|It's just like driving on snow, Houston. By golly!
124:49:48|C|Eng|Gee, I know all about that.
124:49:53|T|CDR|I know you do; but us Florida boys don't know much about it.
124:49:58|T|LMP|It takes these small craters up to a meter just like a piece of cake. You occasionally get blinded by the LCRU mirrors and the TCU mirror.
124:50:13|T|CDR|And the Sun!
124:50:14|T|LMP|Well, that's what I meant. Oh, you mean - I got my thing down.
124:50:19|T|CDR|There's a good idea.
124:50:23|T|LMP|Lookit there, you can see your flags out, John.
124:50:25|T|CDR|Yeah.
124:50:28|C|Eng|And Charlie -
124:50:29|T|CDR|
124:50:29|C|Eng|- could you look at the amps during the higher speed part. We'd like a number.
124:50:35|T|CDR|Okay; well, let us get a higher speed part.
124:50:38|T|LMP|Well, the voltage is - The switch is on Volts right now, John, and I don't want to move to reach down there.
124:50:45|T|CDR|Yeah, if Charlie moves the switch while we're driving, I turn left every time.
124:50:49|C|Eng|Okay; understand.
124:50:03|T|CDR|By gosh, this is really something.
124:50:06|T|LMP|Sure is.
124:51:27|T|CDR|Go, man.
124:51:29|T|LMP|Yahoo!!
124:51:32|T|CDR|Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
124:51:33|T|LMP|Look at that thing dig in.
124:51:36|T|CDR|Boy, we just missed a baddie.
124:51:39|C|Eng|Are you steering all four wheels?
124:51:44|T|CDR|Yup.
124:51:46|C|Eng|No problem?
124:51:50|T|CDR|Nah. I was really going slow at first. I think it would be a problem when you're navigating under unknown terrain.
124:51:00|T|LMP|Okay; we've been making about 10 clicks, Tony, and going just super.
124:51:05|C|Eng|Outstanding.
124:52:07|T|CDR|But you see, going down-Sun or into the Sun - which we're not gonna be doing much of any more - is really - You can't plan ahead far enough to do yourself any good.
124:52:18|C|Eng|Rog.
124:52:19|T|CDR|That's why I was going so slow there at first .
124:52:33|T|CDR|Okay.
124:52:34|T|LMP|And it's a -
124:52:39|T|CDR|Here's a flat place, sort of.
124:52:41|T|LMP|We got to get over there where the - I'd like to get over there so I won't have to get back on, see, and pick up the core stems .
124:52:48|T|CDR|Okay. I got you.
124:52:50|T|LMP|You've got to arm the mortar package -
124:52:52|T|CDR|Right.
124:52:52|T|LMP|- Central Station and Switch 5, CCW .  Okay, why don't we go over to the right, where the stems are. About boresighted on the LSM now.
124:53:06|T|CDR|Yeah.
124:53:15|T|LMP|That is a big one, John.
124:53:17|T|CDR|Oh, man.
124:53:18|T|LMP|Hook a right.
124:53:42|T|LMP|Tony, again, we're just driving by the ALSEP and apologize for that heat flow. I wouldn't trade you - The drill seems to work just great, though. I think it's in good shape right now for the next flight.
124:54:00|C|Eng|Good show, Charlie.
124:54:07|T|LMP|Yeah, that's what I was thinking. See, you could go out up that way and then out over that way towards the LM. Okay?
124:54:12|T|CDR|Right. Right.
124:54:14|T|LMP|Okay. Let me jump off.
124:54:16|C|Eng|A day ago, it didn't look like we were even gonna land, and now we've sampled our first highlands. I feel pretty good about the science without the heat flow.
124:54:27|T|LMP|Well, I know Mark's disappointed, and I sure am.
124:54:30|T|CDR|Me, too.
124:54:30|T|LMP|Frankly, that was just a real shame. That was my big moment, was to get that thing going. Put this camera in here, John. Okay?
124:54:43|T|CDR|Yep.
124:54:45|T|LMP|Okay. Now let me see. , you're suppose to drive 45 degrees to the Sun. Okay?
124:54:51|T|CDR|Yep.
124:54:52|T|LMP|Okay. Let me get the 16 off.
124:54:55|T|CDR|I'll do it from there up towards this way. Okay?
124:54:58|T|LMP|Wait a minute. Okay, which way you gonna drive? From here, this way?
124:55:02|T|CDR|Going over -
124:55:03|T|LMP|Towards Stone ?
124:55:04|T|CDR|You see where that white thing is?
124:55:05|T|LMP|Yeah.
124:55:06|T|CDR|I'll go over there toward a rock and drive up this way. Okay?
124:55:17|T|CDR|Okay.
124:55:18|T|LMP|Okay?
124:55:19|T|CDR|Okay.
124:55:20|T|LMP|Let me get the camera. Let me get it set here now. It's 24 . Gonna be using the trigger, so it's 24 and f/8 at 250.
124:55:39|T|CDR|Hey, that LM makes a nice looking house.
124:55:50|C|Eng|Especially since it's about the only one there.
124:55:56|T|CDR|Yeah.
124:55:59|T|LMP|You're right, Tony. It ain't nothing much up here but a lot of rocks.
124:56:03|T|CDR|Hope the door opens, Charlie.
124:56:05|T|LMP|Huh? What?
124:56:07|T|CDR|I said, I hope the door opens.
124:56:08|T|LMP|It'll open.  - close it.  This thing is stuck. I can't get it up. Let me move out. Okay. To start, I'm suppose to be about 50 meters or so from you.
124:56:28|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. And what I'll do  is drive from A to B, standing start, max velocity readout. And then do some - I'm not going to do much steering control around here, other than to avoid regular craters. I'm going to have to do that anyway.
124:56:51|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay. I'm ready.
124:56:53|T|CDR|And I'm not going to brake it, to amount to anything.
124:56:58|T|LMP|DAC's on; Mark.  That max acceleration?!
124:57:06|T|CDR|No.
124:57:10|T|LMP|Man, you are really bouncing!
124:57:14|C|Eng|Is he on the ground at all -
124:57:16|T|CDR|Okay; that's 10 kilometers .  Huh?
124:57:20|T|LMP|He's got about two wheels on the ground. There's a big rooster tail out of all four wheels. And as he turns, he skids. The back end breaks loose just like on snow. Come on back, John.  And the DAC is running. Man, I'll tell you, Indy 's never seen a driver like this.  Okay, when he hits the craters and starts bouncing is when he gets his rooster tail. He makes sharp turns. Hey, that was a good stop. Those wheels just locked.
124:58:03|T|LMP|Mark, off.
124:58:05|C|Eng|Okay.
124:58:06|T|CDR|Okay, you want to do it one more time?
124:58:07|C|Eng|Had about a minute and 5 seconds that time.
124:58:08|T|LMP|Yeah, .
124:58:19|T|CDR|Yeah. I don't want to run into those holes.
124:58:24|T|LMP|They want 4 minutes' worth, John. That was a minute and five . Maybe you can do it twice more.
124:58:30|T|CDR|Charlie!
124:58:31|T|LMP|Okay. Turn sharp.
124:58:34|T|CDR|I have no desire to turn sharp.  Okay, here's a sharpie.
124:58:39|T|LMP|Hey, that's great!  Man, those things - When those wheels really dig in, John - When you turn is when you get the rooster tail.
124:58:51|C|Eng|Charlie?
124:58:52|T|LMP|The suspension system on that thing is fantastic!
124:58:54|C|Eng|That sounds good. We sound like we probably got enough of the Grand Prix. We're willing to let you go on from here. Call that a Grand Prix.
124:59:03|T|LMP|Okay.  Man, that was all four wheels off the ground, there. Okay. Max stop.
124:59:12|T|CDR|Okay. I don't want to do that.
124:59:13|T|LMP|Okay. Excuse me.
124:59:16|T|CDR|They say that's a no-no.
124:59:22|T|LMP|Okay, DAC off; Mark. Okay, John. DAC's off.
124:59:27|T|CDR|Okay. I have a lot of confidence in the stability of this contraption.
124:59:30|T|LMP|Me, too.
124:59:32|C|Eng|Sounds great.
124:59:34|T|LMP|Okay. You got to dismount, arm the mortar pack -
124:59:43|T|LMP|I'll get them.
124:59:45|T|CDR|Okay. Well, I'll stop it -
124:59:46|T|LMP|Go ahead. I'm going to run back in .
124:59:49|T|CDR|I knew you'd rather get out and walk.
124:59:51|T|LMP|That's right.  watching you in action.
124:59:52|C|Eng|After he saw the way you drove.
124:59:57|T|CDR|Well, when Charlie's in here, it's a lot less bouncy.  And that's the truth. I should say &quot;some&quot; less bouncy.
125:00:22|T|CDR|Okay.
125:00:23|T|LMP|Man, I can't believe mine's going through that much faster. Course, I sweat like crazy. Always have.
125:00:34|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm jogging back in.
125:00:36|C|Eng|Okay.
125:00:41|T|CDR|Charlie, I can't get my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="alsj">seatbelt</a> off.
125:00:43|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
125:00:47|T|CDR|See if you can tell me what the problem is.
125:00:50|T|LMP|Okay. You don't have it -  You don't have it unlocked. Now let it go. No, you don't have it unlocked, John. Got it over center. Push it. Now let your hand go.  See. Wait; wait a minute. Now. You got to let this thing go - You're pushing - Here.
125:01:14|T|CDR|Oh, okay.
125:01:15|T|LMP|Okay; let it -
125:01:16|T|CDR|Okay, I couldn't see it -
125:01:17|T|LMP|Now - There you go.
125:01:18|T|CDR|Okay; fine.
125:01:20|T|LMP|There you go.
125:01:21|T|CDR|Thank you.
125:01:22|T|LMP|You are filthy.
125:01:26|T|CDR|I tell you, there's the pot calling the kettle black.
125:01:37|T|LMP|Man, there's a beautiful secondary, Tony.
125:01:41|C|Eng|Is it oblong or round?
125:01:43|T|LMP|Meter size.  It's round, with a very angular block in it.
125:01:53|C|Eng|I guess we don't have time to look at it, Charlie.
125:01:55|T|CDR|And my purge valve is still in strong .
125:01:58|T|LMP|No, I'm going to press on.
125:01:59|C|Eng|Okay.
125:02:01|T|LMP|I didn't even stop.
125:02:05|C|Eng|Gee, we could have called that a Seatbelt stop.
125:02:11|T|CDR|That's what it was.
125:02:36|T|LMP|Tony, the rocks in this ray near the Lunar Module are entirely different from the ones we've been sampling . They're just different. We're gonna have to make a stop here at Station 10 - Call Station 10 here, right in front of the lunar module and sample here.
125:02:54|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds like a good plan.
125:02:59|T|LMP|Wow, I'm in the dark. I'm at the LM .
125:03:20|T|LMP|Okay. I ran to the third mark down from full ; whatever that is. Empty, I guess. I ran looks like 50 percent of the mag, Tony.
125:03:36|C|Eng|Okay. I've got about 2 minutes and 10 seconds, so that would be about right.
125:03:41|T|LMP|That's about right, then.
125:03:45|T|CDR|Okay, first arming pin is out.  Second pin is going to arm.   I'm going to take -  Third pin is going to arm.  That's as far as it goes. Must be armed.  Now they ought to all be armed. Either that or the pins are broke off.
125:05:07|T|CDR|Okay. At switch 5, we'll go CCW.
125:05:09|C|Eng|Okay.
125:05:19|T|LMP|After you've been out in that Sun awhile, this shadow's really dark.  What's next?  Okay, Tony, the cores are in the bag; breaking out the solar wind.
125:05:41|C|Eng|Okay.  Okay. And, John -
125:05:46|T|CDR|Switch 5 is CCW.
125:05:47|C|Eng|- did that mortar package move at all when you pulled the pins out?
125:05:52|T|CDR|Yeah, it moved, but it's level still.
125:05:54|C|Eng|Okay.
125:06:01|T|CDR|Is there anything else you want me to do while I'm out here , Houston?
125:06:05|C|Eng|Negative.
125:06:09|T|CDR|Huh? Say again?
125:06:10|C|Eng|No, let's head on in.
125:06:14|T|CDR|Okay.
125:06:44|T|LMP|Here, it says &quot;Sun&quot;!
125:06:47|T|CDR|Charlie, figure out where that is.
125:06:49|T|LMP|This is foolproof. &quot;Point this side at Sun, dummy.&quot;  Okay. Solar wind is planted in the Descartes Highlands.  Figure out where what is?
125:07:10|T|CDR|The Sun.
125:07:11|T|LMP|Oh, I was reading the SWC.
125:07:14|T|CDR|Oh.
125:07:18|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. Sounds good.
125:07:20|T|LMP|Okay, I got a -
125:07:22|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; Bearing, 022; Range, 0.1; and that's where it is. And that is no joke.
125:07:31|C|Eng|Outstanding.
125:07:32|T|CDR|That's where we aligned it at. That is fantastic! You want to read these numbers off, or you just want to head out?
125:07:43|C|Eng|Let's have them.  John. We'll take those numbers.
125:08:06|T|CDR|Well, I'm already gone.
125:08:09|C|Eng|That's okay.
125:08:10|T|CDR|En route, now.
125:08:13|C|Eng|Okay. We'll get them when you park .
125:08:44|T|LMP|- right out here that I described, that blue -
125:08:50|T|LMP|That blue one that I described from the lunar module window. And my bluish color is because it's glass coated; but underneath the glass, it's a crystalline rock that, to me, has the same texture as the Genesis Rock, and it's not a breccia.
125:09:17|T|LMP|At least the part I'm looking at is it's not a breccia. Maybe just one big clast. But the part I'm looking at is an igneous, plutonic rock.
125:09:29|C|Eng|Okay. How big was it?
125:09:33|T|LMP|It's about football size little bit smaller. Going into <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> footpad.
125:09:42|C|Eng|Okay.
125:10:37|C|Eng|Rog. You have a water flag.
125:10:41|T|CDR|Turn on the Aux water.  Huh?
125:10:44|T|LMP|Okay, Tony; can I take the pictures of the SWC with my black and white?
125:10:56|C|Eng|Stand by a second.
125:11:01|T|LMP|I've already got it on; I hope you say &quot;yes&quot;.
125:11:03|C|Eng|Yeah, go ahead.
125:11:07|T|LMP|Okay. Thank you.
125:11:10|T|CDR|Okay, Houston.  You're going to 3 .
125:11:13|C|Eng|Okay.
125:11:24|T|LMP|every one of them.
125:11:25|T|CDR|Yeah.
125:11:26|T|LMP|And we didn't see any at the other two craters.
125:11:30|T|CDR|We might have missed some, but I agree I didn't -
125:11:35|T|LMP|Tony, I'd say 15 percent of these rocks are glass coated, and at stops 1 and 2, we didn't see any .
125:11:45|C|Eng|And, Charlie, while you got the camera, taking pictures there, we'd like you to go around and look at that cosmic ray and take a picture of it, and read off the Tempa label.
125:11:56|T|LMP|Yeah. I already took a picture of it . I got the -
125:11:58|C|Eng|Okay. We're going to need a Tempa label reading.
125:12:00|T|LMP|- 7-footer in color.  Okay. I'll go read the temp. You want another picture?
125:12:09|C|Eng|No, we don't need another picture. You might comment if there's any dust on it.
125:12:16|T|LMP|No, it's clean as a whistle.  And, buddy, it must be hot. All of the labels, all three on each side, are black. It's over 140.
125:12:30|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like you to take it off and put it on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> strut, in the shade.
125:12:39|T|LMP|Okay. John will have to do that.
125:12:42|C|Eng|Okay.
125:13:03|C|Eng|Okay. And, Charlie, we'd like to press on with the closeout.
125:13:08|T|LMP|And that's what I'm doing.
125:13:10|C|Eng|Okay.
125:13:37|T|LMP|John, I think we've raised this thing too high.
125:13:58|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. You should have us now.
125:14:25|T|LMP|John, can you take my bag off? I'm ready to press. You've got a whole bag. I emptied yours in there, and it didn't even fill in the SRC, so take my bag off and -
125:14:36|T|CDR|Okay.
125:14:37|T|LMP|- I'll get on with this.
125:14:39|C|Eng|Okay, guys. We'd like to switch out the SCBs in the rock box. And we'd like to put SCB-5 in there instead of SCB-1.
125:14:56|T|CDR|Most of SCB-5 can go in there too, Houston.
125:14:59|T|LMP|Yeah.
125:15:00|C|Eng|Okay. Great.
125:15:01|T|LMP|I think I can get them both in there. I'm emptying them in, Tony.
125:15:03|C|Eng|Good show.
125:15:04|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Like we planned, I'm just emptying them into there.
125:15:09|C|Eng|Okay.
125:15:10|T|LMP|And it packs easier that way.
125:15:42|C|Eng|Thank you, John.
125:15:47|T|CDR|Say again?
125:15:48|C|Eng|I said, &quot;thank you&quot;.
125:15:52|T|CDR|Okay.
125:15:58|C|Eng|And, Charlie, we'll need your frame count sometime.
125:16:03|T|LMP|Okay.
125:16:04|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, going to Reset on the far UV.
125:16:26|C|Eng|And, John, we have a new target for you.
125:16:32|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
125:16:42|T|CDR|Boy, Charlie, you have to watch that battery cable. It's way up in the air around this thing.
125:16:46|T|LMP|I know it.
125:16:48|T|CDR|Say again the azimuth, Houston.
125:16:49|C|Eng|204.
125:16:53|T|CDR|No, you keep clipping out your first number.
125:16:56|C|Eng|Roger. That's azimuth 204, elevation 26.
125:17:04|T|CDR|Okay.  I can't believe that!
125:17:39|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. This thing is getting tighter and tighter in turning in the azimuth. I bet you it ain't going to make it much longer. 204 and 26.
125:18:02|C|Eng|Rog.
125:18:20|T|LMP|Ah! I can't believe it.
125:18:22|T|CDR|Okay; 204 and 26.
125:18:25|C|Eng|Sounds good.
125:18:34|T|CDR|Okay. It may see a little LM there, Houston.  that's what you want; we'll leave it there.
125:18:41|C|Eng|Okay. And, John, we'd like you to go to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Intermediate on your cooling</a>.
125:18:49|T|CDR|Yeah. Okay.
125:19:00|T|LMP|John, you've got to move the cosmic ray.
125:19:04|T|CDR|Oh, yeah. Okay.  get it right now.
125:19:14|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We got all the rocks that we collected, except for a couple of biggies, into the SRC. Over.
125:19:21|C|Eng|Outstanding, Charlie. The reason for putting those others in there, is they wanted the soils in the SRC.
125:19:30|T|LMP|Yeah.
125:19:37|T|CDR|Okay. You want white ring.  right, Tony?
125:19:42|C|Eng|White ring. That's right.
125:20:02|T|LMP|Dog you. Come out of there. Man; you know, I said the battery covers weren't going to get dusty?
125:20:14|T|CDR|Houston, I don't know how to tell you this, but cosmic ray unlocks down at the bottom, but it won't unlock up at the top. Which way do I push it or pull it?
125:20:27|C|Eng|It should be a lift-off. Straight up. Correction. Straight out.
125:20:42|T|CDR|Okay. That's what it is. Fantastic.  Okay. It's set away from the Sun on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> .
125:20:59|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds good.
125:21:06|T|CDR|And Charlie's right; it's up there . Charlie, be careful when you go past the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">minus-Y</a>.
125:21:20|T|LMP|Okay.
125:21:33|C|Eng|Hey, fellows, we're able to see the Earth with your big eye there.
125:21:39|T|LMP|How about that. Pretty sight, isn't it?
125:21:43|C|Eng|Sure is. Man, that's weird.
125:21:48|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, the way I had to set it to make it stand up against the strut, I'd say it has an angle of 50 or 60 degrees to the Sun. And the Sun is shining on the back of it, because the strut won't shield it completely, if you know what I mean. The base of it is down in the footpad, and the top of it is sticking out past the strut.
125:22:18|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, John.
125:22:23|T|LMP|Tony, my frame count -
125:22:24|C|Eng|That's no problem, John. That's good.
125:22:25|T|LMP|- on magazine Bravo.
125:22:29|T|CDR|Okay.
125:22:31|T|LMP|You finished with your pictures, John?
125:22:33|T|CDR|No. I haven't done those yet.
125:22:34|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, my frame count on magazine Bravo was 120.
125:22:39|C|Eng|Okay; 120.
125:22:49|T|LMP|And I'm helping John load up. I'm doing the ETB right now, while he's taking pictures .
125:22:56|C|Eng|Okay.
125:23:41|C|Eng|Charlie, was your magazine Bravo or Golf?
125:23:48|T|LMP|Whatever the one the checklist said.
125:23:55|C|Eng|Okay.
125:23:56|T|LMP|I'll tell you inside; I'm bringing it inside.
125:23:57|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine.
125:24:06|T|LMP|Okay. I've got all the film, John.
125:24:08|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie.
125:24:19|T|CDR|Houston, if I take a down-Sun, I'll have to stand in front of this contraption. You want me to do that? In front of the camera at 3 feet ?
125:24:31|C|Eng|I guess if you stand a few feet away from it, it shouldn't be too bad. Move 8 or 10 feet away, though.
125:25:14|C|Eng|Okay, fine. We'll take it.
125:25:20|T|LMP|Okay, we -  What?
125:25:23|C|Eng|That's fine; we'll take it.
125:25:28|T|LMP|Okay. I dropped it onto the strut part of it broke off. I'm sorry.
125:25:36|T|LMP|Okay,  &quot;Tidy MESA blankets&quot;; I've done that. Big rocks, I've done. I'm ready to clean EMUs and stow <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj"> antennas</a>.
125:25:47|T|CDR|Okay; where does my camera go, Charlie?
125:25:49|T|LMP|Right here in the old ETB.
125:25:52|T|CDR|What are we going to do with this thing? Can we throw it away?
125:25:55|T|LMP|Leave it under the - Throw it away; it's empty. Pull it straight up; there you go. That crummy thing!
125:26:04|T|LMP|Yeah. Well, that's okay.
125:26:07|T|CDR|Look at that.
125:26:13|C|Eng|Okay. To the items that you're transferring up, we'd like to add the Pallet 1 and the LiOH can.
125:26:24|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
125:26:25|T|LMP|Okay, John's frame count is 65.
125:26:43|T|LMP|Glad you remembered that , Tony.
125:26:52|T|CDR|Hey, we have to put that in the pallet, right?
125:26:54|T|LMP|No - Yeah, but hold it.
125:26:56|T|LMP|I don't want it to drop on the dirt.
125:26:58|T|CDR|All right.
125:26:59|T|LMP|-  Let me go put this ETB over - thing.
125:27:05|T|CDR|Put the SRC over there, too.
125:27:07|T|LMP|I can do it over the SRC; it's all right, John.
125:27:12|T|CDR|You can?
125:27:13|T|LMP|Yeah.
125:27:17|T|LMP|I think we overdid it a little bit on that MESA . Why does the thing hit the ground? I don't understand that. Never did in training.
125:27:29|T|CDR|I don't either, Charlie. Maybe we stroked the struts.
125:27:32|T|LMP|I guess maybe you did; it didn't feel like it, though. Nice soft Navy landing.
125:27:39|T|CDR|Thirty g's.
125:27:40|T|LMP|Hot dog! Look at that beauty come out of there  Ha ha!
125:27:44|T|CDR|Stick it right - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
125:27:47|T|LMP|Okay.
125:28:03|C|Eng|Charlie, you can adjust that LEC if you want.
125:28:09|T|LMP|Okay, we will. Why don't you Velcro that down for me, John. John?
125:28:17|T|CDR|Yeah?
125:28:18|T|LMP|Look; can you Velcro that down for me? Excuse me.  There, that's great. Okay. I guess we got to dust and stow <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj"> antennas</a>.
125:28:29|T|CDR|What are you fixing to do with all that stuff, Charlie? Don't drop any of it.
125:28:32|T|LMP|All right. I'm going to put it right over here.
125:28:45|T|CDR|Yeah.
125:29:02|T|CDR|Okay?
125:29:04|T|LMP|Okay; turn around and let me check you. You're okay on this side. Let me check the other side.  You got a couple dangling, too. Can you bend over, John?  Oh, rats. Can't see where that Velcro is on that. Okay. That's got it. Okay.  I've placed the core stems; I've deployed the SRC; HEDC; Commander unload; SCB; close SRC-l; MESA blanket; big rocks. Ready for the clean EMUs.
125:29:41|T|CDR|I think we're ready for that, Charlie.  go get the LCRU brush .
125:29:46|T|LMP|Okay. I'll go run get it.
125:29:47|T|CDR|I'll get it. Let me get it!
125:29:49|T|LMP|Okay.
125:29:50|T|CDR|working too hard as it is.
125:29:55|T|LMP|Man, it doesn't feel like work; it's just fun.
125:29:59|T|CDR|Yeah.
125:30:02|T|LMP|You know the only thing tired on me is my hands. Fingers, really. You'll never get us clean. I think this is a waste of time.
125:30:12|T|CDR|Well, we're going to try it anyway, Charlie.   -
125:30:24|T|LMP|It's coming off.
125:30:26|T|CDR|Yeah. It's coming off.
125:30:31|T|LMP|I think a good kick on the strut would be the best thing .
125:30:42|T|LMP|And I set my water -
125:30:43|T|CDR|Bend over, Charlie?
125:30:55|T|LMP|Yeah.  Tony, be advised that we are not taking any SCBs up. I emptied the SCBs into the SRC.
125:31:08|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
125:31:10|T|CDR|able to get them all in there, Charlie?
125:31:12|T|LMP|Yeah. All the rocks went in there.
125:31:15|C|Eng|You might put - What are you -
125:31:17|T|LMP|Okay, John.  dusting.
125:31:17|C|Eng|- going to put the big rock in? That might go in the SCB.
125:31:22|T|LMP|Okay. It will.
125:31:24|T|CDR|Won't fit! Remember?
125:31:26|T|LMP|No. One of them will. The one I just picked up will. The big one that we picked up out at Flag won't fit.
125:31:36|C|Eng|Okay.
125:31:43|T|CDR|Okay. I've got you, Charlie, as good as I can get you.
125:31:54|T|LMP|Get your hands up.  It's bad in here. You've got some dirt right in here on your - Hold your arm up. There you go.  Get your hoses clean. Man, you can feel that water running through your hose right there, John.
125:32:14|T|CDR|I know.
125:32:16|T|LMP|Great feeling.
125:32:17|T|LMP|Oh, gosh. Guess what I did!
125:32:19|T|CDR|Dropped the brush, Charlie.
125:32:20|T|LMP|Dropped the brush.
125:32:35|T|LMP|Uh-oh!  Ahhh. Come on up.
125:32:43|T|LMP|Okay, I'll start over again.
125:32:45|T|CDR|No. Here. Let me dust the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> first. Okay.
125:32:53|T|CDR|Think it got a lot of it on you, too.
125:32:55|T|LMP|No. That's okay.
125:33:02|C|Eng|Looks like you guys have been playing in a coal bin.
125:33:09|T|CDR|Well, I'm not so sure we want all this stuff to get up there in that machine with us.
125:33:14|T|LMP|I don't know how we're going to get it off!
125:33:16|T|CDR|Just do the best we can.
125:33:17|T|LMP|Yeah. Let me have it, John.
125:33:19|T|CDR|Okay.
125:33:21|T|LMP|I promise not to drop it.   - your pocket's pretty good, John.
125:33:29|T|LMP|Take a little while. Okay. Let me get under here.
125:33:38|T|CDR|I tell you, Houston, my general impression of this thing is I'm a lot more surprised at how really beat up this place is. It must be the oldest stuff around, because it's just craters on top of craters on top of craters. I mean, there's some really big old subdued craters that we don't even have mapped on our photomap, I'm sure of it.
125:34:12|T|LMP|Bend over, John.
125:34:16|T|CDR|Because they just show up as gentle depressions.
125:34:19|T|LMP|Okay, that's good as I can do.
125:34:20|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
125:34:21|T|LMP|There you go.
125:34:23|T|LM Crew|
125:34:26|T|CDR|Okay.
125:34:27|T|LMP|Tony, one of those big rock bags I could - I mean, those big rocks - I could put into the SRC. It's an undocumented rock, grab sample. I don't mean the SRC, but the SCB. Why don't we just leave it there and get it for next time, Tony?
125:34:51|T|LMP|I tell you what; I'm gonna get it. Bag 5.
125:34:58|T|CDR|Well, there's a data point. Just since the time I dusted LCRU and right now, it needs dusting again.
125:34:11|T|CDR|Yeah, hold still. There you go.
125:35:17|C|Eng|Charlie, we think you ought to put the one that you can get in the SCB - put it in a bag and carry it up. That one that's too big, if there's nowhere to stow it upstairs, why don't you just leave that one down.
125:35:29|T|LMP|Oh, there's a place to stow it. We just don't have the big rock bag out!
125:35:33|C|Eng|No, we understand. It'll just get a lot of dust around the cabin with that open rock.
125:35:45|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Do you want your LCRU covers at 65 percent open today ?
125:35:54|C|Eng|That's still affirmative.
125:35:58|T|CDR|And you want your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="alsj">LCRU Power switch</a> to go to Off?
125:36:01|C|Eng|Right. And when you get through there, we'd like to turn the TV away from the Sun and point it down.
125:36:11|T|CDR|Okay.
125:36:30|T|CDR|Okay. Want me to turn you off before I move you away and point you down, or does it make any difference?
125:36:39|C|Eng|It doesn't make any difference.  Okay, point it and then turn it off.
125:36:48|T|LMP|Okay, John. Come stow my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj"> antenna</a> . I'm ready to get in.
125:36:51|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie.
125:36:54|T|LMP|Please.
125:37:14|T|CDR|Okay, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-40.jpg" title="LCRU Battery" target="alsj">LCRU brush is stowed</a>. Okay. Power on the TV is going to Off, Houston.
125:37:21|C|Eng|Okay. And, John, verify that the DAC is turned so the battery's towards the Sun.
125:37:26|T|CDR|I mean the LCRU power .  Houston, how do you read? Over.
125:37:36|C|Eng|Okay, we're copying you, John. And verify the DAC's turned the battery to the Sun.
125:37:52|T|LMP|Can you reach it ?
125:37:53|T|CDR|No, I can't reach it, Charlie.
125:37:56|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute.
125:38:06|T|CDR|- No need to unlock it.
125:38:12|T|LMP|- , go ahead. Houston, how do you read? Over.
125:38:17|C|Eng|We're copying you both 5 by. How us?
125:38:19|T|CDR|receiving us.
125:38:22|T|LMP|Okay; now we got you.
125:38:23|C|Eng|Okay. Good show, and -
125:38:24|T|LMP|
125:38:25|C|Eng|- John, while you're still out there, we'd like you to confirm that the DAC camera is turned with the battery towards the Sun.
125:38:33|T|LMP|I fooled you on that one, Tony; I did it.
125:38:36|C|Eng|Okay.
125:38:46|T|CDR|Okay.
125:38:47|T|LMP|Got it?
125:38:52|T|LMP|That's fine.
125:38:53|T|CDR|Okay. Go.
125:38:54|T|LMP|Okay.
125:38:55|T|CDR|- that's the best I can do.
125:38:56|T|LMP|That's okay. Let me -
125:39:00|T|CDR|Can you get to mine?
125:39:01|T|LMP|Yeah, fine. If I can - .  - get to it, that's where I can get it in that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj">little strap</a> there.  -
125:39:13|T|LMP|Okay, there it goes. Okay, you're down, John.
125:39:19|T|CDR|Okay.
125:39:22|T|LMP|Okay, I'll tell you what. Let me jump up on the ladder and then you hand me that . Okay?
125:39:26|T|CDR|Okay.
125:39:32|T|LMP|We got an SCB , a ETB, a core stem, and the core stem.
125:39:37|T|CDR|Okay.
125:39:39|T|LMP|Man, look at that.
125:39:40|T|CDR|You want to throw the pallet out ?
125:39:43|T|LMP|Yeah, I will. Okay.
125:39:46|T|CDR|Do it.
125:39:47|T|LMP|Got it.
125:39:52|T|CDR|Can you do that all right, Charlie?
125:39:54|T|LMP|Yeah.  Got to step .
125:40:01|T|CDR|Do you need some help?
125:40:02|T|LMP|No, I say you've just got to step.
125:40:04|T|CDR|Okay, do you need some help on getting in there?
125:40:06|T|LMP|Don't think so.
125:40:07|T|CDR|Okay.
125:40:08|T|CDR|Wait, you're just gonna -
125:40:11|T|LMP|I know it.
125:40:21|C|Eng|Okay, John. How you going to carry that large LiOH can up?
125:40:28|T|CDR|Large LiOH can is in the pallet, Houston.
125:40:32|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
125:40:33|T|CDR|Isn't that where it's supposed to be?
125:40:35|C|Eng|That's fine.
125:40:38|T|CDR|Okay.
125:40:41|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm up on the porch.  Ah ha! Hatch opens.
125:41:24|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, the old battery covers <i>are</i> pretty dirty. At least, one of them is. I'll get them.
125:41:45|T|LMP|Guess what?
125:41:46|T|CDR|What?
125:41:47|T|LMP|I'm in.
125:41:48|C|Eng|Good show.
125:41:53|C|Eng|And, John, while you're down there, verify that the LRV battery covers are open and the circuit breakers are all pulled on the LRV .
125:42:05|T|CDR|Okay. I verify that the battery covers are open. I haven't pulled the circuit breakers yet. I'm dusting the battery covers they're dirty.
125:42:13|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
125:42:15|T|CDR|They get dirty from what you might expect; opening the battery covers.
125:42:22|C|Eng|Okay.
125:42:23|T|CDR|I think they're clean before that.
125:42:27|T|LMP|Okay.  Tony, on the LiOH cans, I verify two green .  Copy, Tony?
125:42:47|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
125:42:51|T|LMP|Two green on the LiOH cans.
125:42:52|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, Charlie.
125:42:57|T|CDR|Got two green on the LiOH cans.
125:43:00|T|LMP|John, you ain't gonna believe this, but the food is blown up like a balloon.
125:43:07|T|CDR|You're kidding me.
125:43:08|T|LMP|No. It popped out of that stowage. Busted the snaps.  Gonna take me a few minutes to do this emptying here.
125:43:25|T|CDR|That's the best I can do your batteries, Houston, but I think they're in pretty good shape.
125:43:30|C|Eng|Okay, John; sounds good.
125:43:44|T|CDR|And I re-dusted the LCRU after opening the battery covers because that needed doing.
125:44:12|T|LMP|You can't believe the dirt I've tracked in here, John.
125:44:16|T|CDR|I can believe it, Charlie.
125:44:19|T|LMP|Old Orion was nice and clean; now she's filthy.
125:44:24|T|CDR|Okay, Bus A, B, C, and D coming open.
125:44:27|C|Eng|Okay.
125:44:33|T|CDR|All four buses open.  Okay, Charlie. Can I bring you the SRC-1?
125:44:58|T|LMP|Yeah. Look; I don't want to hit the camera. Here comes the pallet.
125:45:12|T|LMP|All right, that's a good deal.
125:45:14|T|CDR|Yeah.
125:45:20|T|CDR|I know that.  come from a long line of cowards.
125:45:27|T|LMP|Okay, here comes the little <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1201215" target="alsj">doomaflicky</a> out. It landed on the porch.  John, I'm thinking it might be easier - Are you on the ladder yet?
125:46:04|T|CDR|Huh?
125:46:05|T|LMP|Are you on the ladder?
125:46:06|T|CDR|Yep.
125:46:30|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, here comes SRC-1.
125:46:33|T|LMP|Okay.
125:46:38|T|CDR|Can you get it?
125:46:39|T|LMP|Yeah, I think so.  Wait a minute.
125:46:47|T|CDR|-
125:46:58|T|LMP|Let me give you this thing here.
125:46:59|T|CDR|Okay, give me that thing.
125:47:06|T|LMP|Got it?
125:47:07|T|CDR|Yep.
125:47:09|T|LMP|Okay, let me keep this SRC up where I can grab the handle.
125:47:11|T|CDR|Okay; going back down .
125:47:13|T|LMP|Okay. Now, we've got the core stems, an SCB -
125:47:17|T|CDR|Yeah.
125:47:18|T|LMP|And that's it. And then an ETB.
125:47:22|T|CDR|Rog.
125:47:29|T|LMP|Hardest part of the whole EVA, Tony.
125:47:39|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
125:47:43|T|LMP|I say getting into this moose is the hardest job of the whole EVA.
125:47:49|T|CDR|Okay, and there's the pallet. What did you bring up with you?
125:47:57|T|LMP|I brought the pallet. We've got an SCB, the core stems, and the ETB.
125:48:06|T|CDR|Okay. Hardly nothing in the SCB, right?
125:48:08|T|LMP|One big rock is all.
125:48:09|T|CDR|Yeah.  Whew!
125:48:20|T|LMP|That other big muley we'll get with the big rock bag later on.  Think you can do that all one-handed, John, huh?
125:48:36|T|CDR|If I can jump up to the third rung. All I got to do here is jump.  Ah. There we go.
125:48:44|T|LMP|He jumps over buildings with a single bound, Houston! Faster than a speeding bullet.
125:48:55|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're bringing SCB number 5 in with a big rock.
125:48:59|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
125:49:06|T|CDR|- core.
125:49:08|T|LMP|Wait a minute. You're going to have to stick those up in the -
125:49:10|T|CDR|Oh, don't kick them back out, Charlie -
125:49:11|T|LMP|I'm not.
125:49:12|T|CDR|Hold still. I'll get them. I'll give them to you.
125:49:16|T|LMP|Okay. Can you hand them up?
125:49:18|T|CDR|How's that?
125:49:19|T|LMP|I say great! Got them. Filthy.
125:49:25|T|CDR|Here you go.
125:49:27|T|LMP|Gimme - No.
125:49:33|T|CDR|Here's your SCB.
125:49:34|T|LMP|Okay.
125:49:41|T|CDR|Okay, let me get you an ETB.
125:49:46|T|LMP|Tony, read out the ETB stuff.
125:49:52|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. You -
125:49:53|T|LMP|Just didn't look quite full to me.
125:49:54|C|Eng|Right, you have two HEDC mags, B and D; three HEDC mags, A, C, and H; one 500-millimeter mag L; three DAC mags, P, Q, and R; your maps; and six sample contingency bags - or &quot;containment bags&quot;.
125:50:21|T|LMP|Okay, John. I didn't get that.
125:50:25|T|CDR|You didn't hear any of it?
125:50:26|T|LMP|I did not get those bags. See, I don't have that on my checklist.
125:50:32|T|CDR|Okay.
125:50:33|T|LMP|And they're on the MESA.
125:50:35|T|CDR|Okay, I'll go get them.
125:50:36|T|LMP|Okay; they're for these cover bags.
125:50:38|T|CDR|Yeah, right.
125:50:41|C|Eng|Okay. They're in the left front of the MESA, John.
125:50:46|T|CDR|Yeah, I know where they're at. Okay, now it doesn't hit the deck anymore. That hit the deck some more.
125:51:02|T|LMP|Tony, I have 6 58 .
125:51:06|C|Eng|That's right.
125:51:39|T|CDR|Okay.
125:51:42|T|LMP|Yeah, I think that was the only thing I didn't have, John.
125:51:45|T|CDR|Okay.
125:51:56|C|Eng|Roger. You should have six DAC mags - Correction, six Hasselblad mags and three DAC mags.
125:52:06|T|LMP|Yeah, I've got all the film.
125:52:10|C|Eng|Okay.
125:52:18|T|CDR|These bags are on the left side of the MESA, right, Charlie?
125:52:21|T|LMP|Yeah.
125:52:22|T|CDR|Left front.
125:52:23|T|LMP|Right where the SWC - I mean, the core stem bags were.
125:52:30|T|CDR|Yeah, I've got them up here.
125:52:41|C|Eng|And, John, maybe you could set the UV -
125:52:42|T|CDR|Right where the core stem bags was?
125:52:46|C|Eng|- before you go up this time.
125:52:48|T|CDR|Is it sample containment bags?
125:52:50|T|LMP|That's right.
125:52:51|T|CDR|Okay. Oh, okay. And underneath that is a flag for the old whatchacallit. I'm not sure there's any sample containment bags in there, Char - Yeah, I guess maybe there are.  I'll bring them up separate, Charlie.  You want me to reset the UV before I go up this time?
125:53:18|C|Eng|Yeah, it would be a good idea. Then you could just stay up.
125:53:20|T|LMP|Why don't you bring the -
125:53:25|T|CDR|Oh, dear. Okay.
125:53:38|T|LMP|John, when you come up, if you remember to bounce your feet on the struts -
125:53:45|T|CDR|Okay.
125:53:46|T|LMP|- it'll clean them off. That's what I'm doing up in the - by moving on the floor.
125:53:52|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;ETB, then set the far UV&quot;. What's the target, Houston? I'm over at the far UV.
125:53:58|C|Eng|Okay. Reset. And then the target is 134 azimuth and 39 elevation.
125:54:11|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay, Houston; 3, 2, 1, Mark. Reset. 134 azimuth.  Houston, can I hit the Reset again? I didn't see the film move.  No; it did.
125:54:44|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
125:54:48|T|CDR|Because it's re-moding. Boy.
125:55:03|C|Eng|Okay, that azimuth was 134.
125:55:10|T|CDR|134 is looking at the lunar module, Houston! You don't want to do that.
125:55:17|C|Eng|Okay. Would an elevation of 39 look over it?
125:55:25|T|CDR|Heck, no. It's at 26 now it's not clearing it.
125:55:39|T|CDR|Well, let me see, it might.
125:55:45|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, I just got a water flag.
125:55:48|T|CDR|If you want to take a look at Charlie , yeah, it'll clear it, but that's not any good, Houston.
125:56:01|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. What do you have?
125:56:05|T|CDR|He has a water flag.
125:56:20|C|Eng|Okay. Azimuth is 258, elevation is 64.
125:56:29|T|CDR|Okay. I'm going to go to Reset again; will that be all right?
125:56:32|C|Eng|That's fine.
125:56:33|T|CDR|Because I can't make it.  Okay, Reset; Mark. 258, 64.

126:11:30|T|LM Crew|-
126:12:14|T|LMP|Old TELMU, Tony, should have seen the water quantity go down about 10 percent on that drink.
126:12:22|C|Eng|Okay. We saw it, Charlie.
126:12:28|T|LMP|Boy, it tasted good. Okay; &quot;verify safety. Descent H2O valve, Open. Remove Purge Valve; stow in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-purse.html" target="alsj">purse</a>. Okay; disconnect OPS O2 hose.&quot;

126:13:40|T|CDR|Try not to step on that bag. That one's got to go back to the - Okay. I can't believe this is so dirty.  Ah!
126:14:01|T|CDR|Well it works good, when you - get around to it.
126:14:48|T|LMP|Okay, why don't you turn and face me, and I'll get to your O2 .  -  I've already got mine.
126:14:57|T|CDR|You got yours?

126:15:14|T|LMP|Okay. And just - I'll read the checklist. &quot;Disconnect OPS O2 hose; connect LM hoses&quot; - funny that we have to do that. &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_isolation_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Isol</a>, both, Suit Flow; PLSS Pump, Off, and Fan, Off.&quot;

126:19:51|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;PLSS Mode &quot; - Houston, how do you read? Over.
126:20:03|T|CDR|Turn sideways, Charlie, and let me get you some oxygen.
126:20:10|T|LMP|We are still in Down-Voice Backup, we should be hot miked.
126:20:14|T|CDR|That's what I figured.
126:20:15|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read? Over.
126:20:19|C|Mit|Orion, this is Houston. You're hot mike to us.
126:20:22|T|CDR|Okay, you got to -

126:21:25|T|LMP|Uh-uh.
126:21:26|T|CDR|Poor fellow. You better get your hearing checked.
126:21:28|T|LMP|You sure that's open?
126:21:30|T|CDR|Yeah! Just about ran out of oxygen, too, while you were at it, didn't you? Hey, Houston, can you give us a mark at the end of 4 minutes?
126:21:39|C|Mit|Roger. Starting now.
126:21:42|T|CDR|You're already -  Okay.

126:22:03|C|Mit|Real great. Did a fine job.
126:22:07|T|CDR|That's good. It's a lot of fun, I'll tell you that. By gosh, if it isn't.
126:22:13|C|Mit|You bet your life.  Just take her easy there and catch your breath; and I'll let you know when 4 minutes is up.
126:22:31|T|CDR|That's what we're doing.
126:22:45|C|Mit|Surprisingly enough, John, we have better comm now than before you went out, on the LM.
126:22:53|T|CDR|I don't understand that. They must have a big dish still up.
126:23:00|T|LMP|Hey, Ed, it's really a spectacular place. And I know why you were so excited at Fra Mauro.
126:23:05|C|Mit|Roger, Roger, Charlie.
126:23:06|T|LMP|Boy, that is a -
126:23:07|C|Mit|And our comm is better because we have the 210 up now.
126:23:12|T|CDR|Yeah.
126:23:15|T|LMP|How long we gonna have that beauty?
126:23:32|C|Mit|We'll only have it for a few hours here, but we're hoping to have it for a good portion of the other EVAs, but I don't have the exact numbers yet.
126:23:44|T|LMP|Thanks, Ed.
126:23:50|T|CDR|Hey, Ed; you're right; it was almost do-able.
126:23:57|C|Mit|Pretty close to the margin there, John.
126:23:59|T|CDR|We only had a 100 - Yeah, we only had 110 percent this time.
126:24:05|C|Mit|You're right. And belay my last . I don't guess we'll have that large antenna.
126:24:17|T|LMP|That's okay.
126:24:20|C|Mit|Well, the comm during the EVA was magnificent.
126:24:23|T|LMP|I guess for you guys the -
126:24:25|T|CDR|Was it good, huh?
126:24:26|C|Mit|Yeah, really great.
126:24:30|T|LMP|Ed, you guys have been loud and clear to us every time on your uplink, regardless of the dish.
126:24:40|T|CDR|That's right.
126:24:41|T|LMP|Sorry we're so bad to you.
126:24:47|C|Mit|Okay. We've got about 50 seconds to go here -
126:24:48|T|LMP|I just can't get that steerable working. It just won't -
126:24:49|C|Mit|- on the PLSS fill.
126:24:56|T|LMP|Okay.
126:25:03|T|CDR|Sock some water to me, Charlie.
126:25:04|T|LMP|Okay, how about a little squirt?
126:25:08|T|CDR|Man, this LCG pump cooling is the best thing they ever built.
126:25:13|C|Mit|That's pretty great, isn't it?
126:25:15|T|CDR|That's enough.  Yeah.
126:25:21|T|LMP|John says &quot;sock some water to me,&quot; and I just get the breaker , and he says &quot;that's enough.&quot; Every time. Man, it really freezes you.
126:25:28|T|CDR|You can't take it any long length of time; you just have to turn it on to get your suit all cooled down in about 10 seconds and shut it back off again.
126:25:38|C|Mit|You're right. Okay, Mark, 4 minutes. You can go to the next one.
126:25:44|T|LM Crew|Okay.
126:25:49|T|CDR|Okay, PLSS Fill coming Off.
126:25:53|T|LMP|You want me to reach that, John?
126:25:54|T|CDR|Yeah, can you get it, Charlie?
126:25:57|T|LMP|Yeah.
126:25:58|T|CDR|Yeah; that's a hard valve, isn't it?
126:25:59|T|LMP|Okay, it's Closed.
126:26:00|T|CDR|It's hard from where I'm at.
126:26:02|T|LMP|Closed is clockwise, isn't it?
126:26:03|T|CDR|Yeah. Okay. Let me get you out of this thing. Uh-oh.  Can you get up like this a little? There it goes. I knew that QD would come open. There it is. Okay, would you keep that hose out of the dust.
126:26:26|C|Mit|And we'll take your reading when you get to it there, John.
126:26:37|T|CDR|Okay.  What you got, Charlie?
126:26:45|T|LMP|I don't know. Does it say turn the -
126:26:49|T|CDR|I don't think it said - Did -  Yeah, AR.
126:26:56|T|LMP|95 percent.
126:26:57|T|CDR|95 percent!
126:26:58|T|LMP|Yeah.
126:26:59|C|Mit|Okay. Copy 95.
126:27:00|T|CDR|
126:27:01|T|LMP|Hey, Houston, I got -  Yeah. Ain't that amazing!
126:27:06|C|Mit|That sounds like a good fill.
126:27:07|T|LMP|Four minutes. Okay.  Let me have that dadgum.
126:27:19|T|CDR|Can you get mine?
126:27:22|T|LMP|Where are we in the Checklist? Let me -
126:27:25|T|CDR|O2 PLSS fill.
126:27:28|T|LMP|Okay.
126:27:30|T|CDR|Okay, yeah. All you need to do is put that thing to my side there; and let me stand here for 4 minutes.
126:27:40|T|LMP|Think you could do that, huh?
126:27:42|T|CDR|Yeah. Give me a little <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../water_gun.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">water gun</a> for a little water gun fill, too.
126:27:46|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute.
126:28:04|T|LMP|Okay, you'll have to move up , John, a little bit if you can. Can you?
126:28:05|T|CDR|Up where?
126:28:09|T|LMP|Okay, Ed, on my mark. Mark. It's Open.
126:28:14|C|Mit|Roger.
126:28:16|T|LMP|Here you go.  John?
126:28:21|T|CDR|Okay, thank you.
126:28:36|T|LMP|I can't believe it.  And I sucked that beauty dry.
126:29:07|C|Mit|Say, Orion. We figure this 8 minutes of refill is enough rest. We'll start EVA-2 immediately.
126:29:19|T|CDR|You better send a couple more guys up here.  You better start them here in the next 5 minutes.
126:29:26|T|LMP|Yeah, I really think I could take another couple hours except for my fingers.
126:29:30|T|CDR|Yeah, I think so too. I could do the running around; that would be a piece of cake.
126:29:35|C|Mit|Yeah, they start to get bloody stumps after while, don't they, Charlie?
126:29:40|T|LMP|That's exactly what they feel like, Ed.  But it's worth a bloody stub or two, I'll tell you. That was really an experience!
126:30:00|T|CDR|Yeah, my suspicion was confirmed on the rocks. Some rocks had dust all over them, and some didn't have any. And still don't and still do.
126:30:09|C|Mit|Sounds familiar.
126:30:25|T|LMP|Boy, I tell you these little EMUs - PLSSs - are really super-fantastic.
126:30:35|C|Mit|They do a pretty fine job.
126:30:36|T|CDR|Next time you get a chance with the camera, look and see what we landed just beyond.
126:30:48|C|Mit|Okay.
126:30:50|T|LMP|Ed, you won't believe the size of that hole back there. You just won't believe the size of that hole behind the LM.
126:30:57|C|Mit|Charlie, I believe anything.
126:30:58|T|LMP|I never saw that .
126:30:59|C|Mit|I'm gullible.
126:31:18|T|LMP|How's our time, Ed, ?
126:31:20|C|Mit|Got about 50 seconds .
126:31:25|T|LMP|Thank you.
126:31:46|T|LMP|Don't hog all the water.
126:32:01|T|CDR|Houston, when we do a water recharge, if we set the PLSSs on the floor or on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">midstep</a>, is this thing level enough so that we won't have a tilted PLSS? As long as the PLSS is vertical? Or in my station?
126:32:24|C|Mit|Stand by on it, John, we think so. We'll have a good answer in a moment, and your 4 minutes is up. You can press on. Give us a readout.
126:32:32|T|CDR|Okay.
126:32:59|T|CDR|94.5 percent. Houston, ninety-four and a half.
126:33:10|C|Mit|John, say again your number.
126:33:15|T|CDR|94.5.
126:33:17|C|Mit|Roger; 94.5. And, John, setting it on the floor will be fine, if the hose is long enough so it doesn't tilt.
126:33:29|T|CDR|Okay. On the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">midstep</a> is where we're thinking about doing it.
126:33:36|C|Mit|That's really the best place.
126:33:38|T|LMP|Okay, stow the supply hose which is -  You can't move? No, that's the wrong way. I want - They want us to stow this thing, but I guess we could leave that out.
126:33:53|T|CDR|What's that?
126:33:54|T|LMP|That the supply hose.
126:33:56|T|CDR|Oh, I'll stow it.
126:33:57|T|LMP|Okay.
126:34:02|T|CDR|Shoot, Charlie. All you gotta do is ask. I'll admit I ain't paying any attention, but you might as well ask anyhow.
126:34:19|T|CDR|That was really something else.
126:34:35|T|LMP|Okay. &quot;Disconnect OPS actuator from <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a>; disconnect RCU from PGA.&quot;
126:34:41|T|CDR|There you go.  It's that thing right there.
126:34:54|T|LMP|Wait a minute, John. Before I do this, I got a wet rag over here. I'm gonna wipe that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> off before I put it anywhere.
126:35:02|T|CDR|That's a good idea.  In fact, I'd like to wipe off the front of your suit in a couple of places. The only place you haven't got dirt is on your neckring.
126:35:42|T|LMP|Sorry I gave out of water there. We'd have gone another hour. Man -
126:35:49|T|CDR|You were really huffing and puffing on the drill.
126:35:51|T|LMP|Yeah. Well, when I was <i>really</i> huffing is when I went over and got that rock and fell down. That's how I got so dirty.
126:35:58|T|CDR|Oh.
126:36:03|T|LMP|Because I had the camera on, and I couldn't get close enough to spring up, so I backed into a crater.
126:36:11|T|CDR|Oh.
126:36:21|T|LMP|Hey, that's going to work neat, John. We can wipe our PGAs with something like that. Okay, disconnect <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a> - that's this thing - from the PGA.
126:36:32|T|CDR|Okay, there's mine. Here.  Okay.
126:36:37|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute; let me read on.
126:36:40|T|CDR|&quot;Verify Fan, Off; Pump, Off.&quot;
126:36:41|T|LMP|Yeah, everything off; &quot;Mode Select, 0&quot;; and then -
126:36:42|T|CDR|&quot;Mode Select, 0.&quot;
126:36:43|T|LMP|- disconnect it from the PLSS.
126:36:45|T|CDR|PLSS. Okay.
126:36:46|T|LMP|-
126:36:52|T|CDR|Okay, that's yours, Charlie.
126:36:54|T|LMP|Okay, yours goes in first. Let me get my - connected.
126:37:02|T|CDR|Okay, babe.  Okay. That's one.
126:37:30|T|CDR|It occurs to me when we suit up tomorrow, we're going to have to wash our hands before we can put our gloves on, or we'll get a lot of dirt in the suit loop.
126:37:43|T|CDR|Well, that's got it. It ain't going anywhere.
126:37:48|T|LMP|Okay. &quot;Disconnect PLSS O2 hoses; doff PLSS and OPS, mine first. Stow LMP PLSS on floor, and yours on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">midstep</a>.&quot;
126:38:01|T|CDR|Okay.
126:38:13|T|LMP|How'd I get so dirty?!
126:38:24|T|CDR|Let me get some of this off down here, Charlie.
126:38:27|T|LMP|Okay.  Put that around here.
126:38:33|T|CDR|Yeah, that's okay.
126:38:35|T|LMP|Okay.
126:38:49|T|LMP|Here, let me have this. I want to get this connector clean right here.
126:39:14|T|CDR|Dadgummit! I knew I was going to do something I'd forget again. I was going to cut my fingernails. Look at those fingers.
126:39:22|T|LMP|Yeah. Mine are the same way, and I cut mine. I don't think it has anything to do with that.
126:39:38|T|LMP|Okay, you're free, and I'm free. Let me doff mine first, and I'll put mine against the -
126:39:45|T|CDR|Okay.  Got it, Charlie.
126:39:55|T|LMP|Hold onto it.
126:39:56|T|CDR|I got it.
126:40:00|T|LMP|Okay, I got it.
126:40:02|T|CDR|You got one side of it. I got the other side.
126:40:03|T|LMP|Okay, let it go, I got it.
126:40:07|T|CDR|You're hung up on something.
126:40:45|T|CDR|- , Charlie. Don't cut yourself on that - Okay, now that - I couldn't put it in here.
126:40:49|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay. &quot;Report OPS pressure.&quot; Okay. Let's get your PLSS off and then I'll stow - Let me stow this stuff, okay?
126:41:03|T|CDR|Okay. That's a good idea.
126:41:39|T|LMP|Okay. Now, I want to stick that beauty right up under there for now. Okay. Now, we're ready to get yours off. Yours goes to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">midstep</a>.
126:42:20|T|LMP|Can you pick up on it ?
126:42:21|T|CDR|Oh yeah.
126:42:29|T|LMP|Okay.
126:42:31|T|CDR|Got it?
126:42:32|T|LMP|Okay. Okay; to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">midstep</a> with that one, and look at your OPS pressure.
126:42:43|T|CDR|Yeah, oh - Let me tell you.
126:42:47|T|LMP|It's a bucket of worms, isn't it?
126:42:49|T|CDR|What the bucket of worms is, is old dumb-dumb here is turning the wrong direction.
126:42:52|T|LMP|Okay, Ed. John's OPS is 5900 and mine is about 6050.
126:43:02|C|Mit|Okay. I copied that, Charlie.
126:43:10|T|LMP|We've got the PLSS doffed now. We're stowing the OPS hoses .
126:43:16|C|Mit|Roger.
126:44:08|T|CDR|Better do something about that, Charlie.
126:44:10|T|LMP|What?  About what, John?
126:44:27|T|LMP|I don't know.  -  We can get a piece of tape and put over it.
126:44:30|T|CDR|Yeah.  &quot;PLSS&quot; electrical dust cap.
126:44:36|T|LMP|Oh, that's these things.
126:44:38|T|CDR|- covers.
126:44:40|T|LMP|Yeah.
126:45:26|T|CDR|Okay. Where are the PLSS batts at?
126:45:29|T|LMP|Right up here.  You got number 1?
126:45:41|T|CDR|Yeah.
126:45:42|T|LMP|You get number 3.
126:45:57|T|CDR|Okay. There's number 1, and it's being replaced by number 3.
126:45:02|T|LMP|Old number 1! It's hot, too, boy.
126:46:06|T|CDR|Put this cover on it, so we can make sure it's been used.
126:46:08|T|LMP|Okay.
126:46:12|T|CDR|Well, that really ain't too good of a clue, is it?
126:46:32|T|LMP|Boy, I know what I'd like right now.
126:46:34|T|CDR|They want the PLSS battery connected?
126:46:36|T|LMP|Yes.
126:46:51|T|CDR|Okay. That's connected.
126:46:52|T|LMP|Okay, now we connect your hoses. All of them.
126:46:58|T|CDR|Oh.  Okay, let me see that diagram one more time.  &quot;Y&quot; is this one.
126:47:17|T|LMP|Thank goodness for those covers. You didn't get it, John.
126:47:24|T|CDR|Yeah, I did.
126:47:26|T|LMP|It didn't go all the way in. No, see, it pops out on you. There.
126:47:29|T|CDR|Oh. One, two is the -
126:47:35|T|LMP|Looks like the water .
126:47:37|T|CDR|Yeah, it's the water.  Okay. That's got it. Three is the electrical. - electrical.
126:48:05|T|LMP|That's this one.
126:48:14|T|CDR|- what it really is.
126:48:29|T|CDR|Oh, man! You're right. It keeps popping out.
126:48:36|T|LMP|There, you got it.
126:48:40|T|CDR|Three and four is this.  And that should have been 1.
126:48:51|T|LMP|Okay. Okay; &quot;Disconnect left end of PLSS tool harness. Change LiOH cartridge, temp less than 130. Read cartridge decal. Stow used LiOH cartridge inside canisters. Stow canisters in Buddy SLSS bag. Install PLSS tool harness.&quot; Okay?
126:49:13|T|CDR|Okay.
126:49:27|T|CDR|Need another shot of agua, Charlie.
126:49:29|T|LMP|Agua coming up.
126:49:36|T|CDR|I don't know how we're going to take this thing down.
126:49:41|T|LMP|Well, let's undo the bottom and just slide it up, how's that?
126:49:44|T|CDR|Okay.
126:49:45|T|LMP|See, the bottom's already loose.
126:49:50|T|CDR|That's got it.
126:49:52|T|LMP|Okay, I'll get you a canister.
126:49:54|T|CDR|Okay.
126:49:55|T|LMP|If I can reach it.
126:50:01|T|CDR|happened to be number 1.  I believe it was in a vacuum!
126:50:11|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. That's got me.
126:50:13|T|LMP|Okay you got 1? Okay. That's the wrong one.
126:50:15|T|CDR|No, wait a minute. Yeah, this is 1.
126:50:18|T|LMP|That you got out already?
126:50:19|T|CDR|Yeah.
126:50:20|T|LMP|Okay. Whew. Oh man!
126:50:25|T|CDR|Dadgum it!
126:50:42|T|LMP|Man, I'd thought I'd had it out there with that LCRU . I couldn't get that Astromate connector done. The thing is, the cable's just too stiff. I'd push down on it -
126:50:53|T|CDR|Yeah?
126:50:54|T|LMP|- and the cable would push me back.
126:50:55|T|CDR|I know it.  I had a heck of a time setting up the Central Station, for some reason. Never had any problem with that before.
126:51:02|T|LMP|Yeah, me either. Same thing with that connector. Never had had a problem before.
126:51:18|T|CDR|You know, that's the kind of thing you want to push on just as hard as you need to do to get it, but you don't want to push on it hard enough to booger it.
126:51:23|T|LMP|I know it.
126:51:24|T|CDR|And the question is how hard is that in one-sixth gravity? I don't know.
126:51:39|T|LMP|Well, you can put a lot of - That old jack, John, just brought that core stem right out of there. Sure wish we could have had that -
126:51:52|T|CDR|Okay. That's got it; it's in and locked.
126:51:56|T|LMP|Okay, now we got to reinstall the tool harness .
126:51:58|T|CDR|Okay.  Well, I don't know. Man, I never even saw that thing until all of a sudden I turned around, and there it was following me.
126:52:18|T|LMP|Okay, let's do this. Pull this down, John. Okay. Now wait a minute; slide it under here.  Tell you what, let me undo it a little bit.
126:52:39|T|CDR|Okay. Mine was already slid under.
126:52:41|T|LMP|Mine wasn't on this side. Okay; now I'll tighten it up for you.
126:52:47|T|CDR|Okay. Whoa, whoa, Charlie. I'll never stow it, now. You got to let it up.
126:52:52|T|LMP|Okay.
126:52:55|T|CDR|It's down over this beam.
126:52:57|T|LMP|No need to get it too tight; we've got to get in here anyway for -
126:53:00|T|CDR|That's right. We've got to -
126:53:03|T|LMP|- for the refill.
126:53:04|T|CDR|- for the refill .
126:53:05|T|LMP|Okay.
126:53:06|T|CDR|One more -
126:53:07|T|LMP|Boy, is that the lunar dust that smells so funny?! You think?
126:53:08|T|CDR|No. No, I don't know what it is.
126:53:15|T|LMP|Okay.  &quot;Disconnect OPS antennas to remove OPS and stow antenna lead.&quot;
126:53:21|T|CDR|Okay.
126:53:22|T|LMP|&quot;Stow commander's OPS on engine cover. Stow commander's PLSS in recharge station.&quot;  Whew!  We're gonna have to hook that back up, because we're going to do a checkout again tomorrow.
126:53:52|T|CDR|And hook it into here.
126:53:53|T|LMP|Yeah.
126:53:55|T|CDR|That's right.  Well, I hate to tell you this, but it's just not long enough.
126:54:06|T|LMP|Well, I'll have to -
126:54:07|T|CDR|- hose.
126:54:08|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute.  Okay, that ought to do it.   reach?
126:54:23|T|CDR|Yeah. In and locked. It's locked.
126:54:33|T|LMP|&quot;Rope finger on PLSS.&quot;
126:54:37|T|LMP|Okay, now comes our major chore. Getting that beauty into that -
126:54:50|T|LMP|It's in the purse.
126:54:53|T|CDR|In the purse, huh?
126:56:04|T|LMP|might have too much junk sticking out there, John.
126:56:10|T|CDR|That ain't the problem.  Okay.
126:56:22|T|LMP|Do you want me to slide around on this side and help?
126:56:31|T|CDR|I need that flashlight again, Charlie.
126:56:33|T|LMP|What did you do with it? Put it back in here?
126:56:44|T|CDR|Okay.
126:56:46|T|LMP|Let me help.
126:56:48|T|CDR|Okay.
126:57:02|T|LMP|Well. One reason you didn't - This thing wasn't hanging over here.
126:57:10|T|CDR|Okay. Okay?
126:57:12|T|LMP|Okay. Now.
126:57:17|C|Mit|Orion, Houston. When you get a moment, give us normal voice.
126:57:25|T|CDR|Okay.  Look, Charlie, it's not making it.
126:57:31|T|LMP|I know it's not making it! You got too much - The hoses are sticking out too far. I could get this side right now.
126:57:42|T|CDR|You could?
126:57:43|T|LMP|Yeah.
126:57:44|T|CDR|I've almost got it over here.  Great. Can you raise up on it a hair?
126:57:51|T|LMP|Yeah, this way?
126:57:52|T|CDR|No, the other way. There you go! Okay. Now, push toward the wall.
126:57:55|T|LMP|Okay.
126:57:56|T|CDR|There you go. Push toward the wall.
126:57:58|T|LMP|Okay.
126:57:59|T|CDR|Okay, now, screw it in.
126:58:03|T|LMP|Okay.  Wait a minute. Give me the flashlight, now.  Okay. Down a little bit.
126:58:20|T|CDR|Okay.
126:58:33|T|LMP|There we go.
126:58:34|T|CDR|You got it.
126:58:35|T|LMP|Yeah.
126:58:36|T|CDR|Ahh.  Houston, that was accomplished in only - It only took us 10 minutes to stow the PLSS.
126:58:47|C|Mit|Well, that's about 2 minutes better than usual.
126:58:59|T|CDR|Oh.
126:59:03|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay.  &quot;Commander's PLSS -  LMPlee's - LMP's PLSS to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="alsj">midstep</a>&quot;.
126:59:10|C|Mit|And, Charlie, we'd like that Normal Voice when you get a second.
126:59:13|T|CDR|Stow the hose.
127:00:03|T|CDR|Houston, how do you read us on Normal Voice? Over.
127:00:06|C|Mit|Okay, reading you loud and clear on Normal Voice. And also check panel 16, Comm Display circuit breaker closed. Verify it for us, please.
127:00:19|T|LMP|No, sir. It was open.
127:00:21|C|Mit|Okay. It's open. Please close it.
127:00:26|T|LMP|It's closed now, Ed.
127:00:28|C|Mit|Okay, Charlie. Thank you. Okay, and give us High Bit Rate now, Charlie.
127:00:40|T|LMP|Okay, you got High Bit Rate.
127:01:13|T|LMP|What time is the GET now, Ed?
127:01:16|C|Mit|Okay. Your GET now is 127:13.
127:01:23|T|LMP|Okay.
127:01:24|C|Mit|And we'll be changing the procedure slightly, Charlie, so let us know - Well, we'll call you when it's time to do that battery management.
127:01:34|T|LMP|That's fine. We don't have any tick-tock, so if you'll just call us, we'll appreciate it.
127:01:38|C|Mit|Okay. And let me advise you of something that's coming up. Before you get your PGAs doffed and over the engine cover , we want to stow that extra LiOH canister back in the bracket there.
127:01:51|T|LMP|Okay, yeah; we'll get that.
127:02:05|C|Mit|And Orion; Houston. We're showing your Suit Disconnect valves in Disconnect.
127:02:17|T|LMP|That's affirmative. We don't have the hoses hooked up. I'll hook up - I'll turn on the air.
127:02:32|C|Mit|Good enough. Thank you, Charlie.
127:02:41|T|LMP|Ed, we're in - Here's our configuration, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return </a> is Open; <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_circuit_relief_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Circuit Relief </a> to Auto; <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter </a>, Push Cabin; the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_isolation_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Isol Valves</a> are in Suit Flow; and the hoses are hooked up to the wall.
127:02:58|C|Mit|Okay, Charlie. Fine.
127:10:31|T|LMP|Okay, Ed we're on the Lunar Surface Checklist, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">page 3-4</a>. Over.
127:14:17|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. SCB bag in bag 5, and it weighs 14 pounds.
127:14:28|T|CDR|Of which at least 10 pounds must be the SCB.
127:14:32|C|Eng|Oh, you collected a lot of rocks out there.
127:14:44|T|LMP|That was only one rock, and that was a grab sample that I got about 30 meters in front of the LM. Over.
127:14:51|C|Eng|Right. That's right.
127:14:55|T|LMP|Okay. SRC number 1 weighs 42 pounds.
127:15:01|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.
127:15:07|T|LMP|And that's all the rocks we got.
127:15:11|C|Eng|Okay.
127:15:47|C|Eng|Okay. I don't know how factual it is, but I remember getting a note the last week before launch that you had your rock control weight up to 215 pounds.
127:16:01|T|CDR|Okay, Tony. We'll get 215 pounds of rock.
127:16:04|C|Eng|I bet you will.
127:16:05|T|CDR|How much have we got now?
127:17:09|C|Eng|Okay, and that SCB-5 we'd just like you to stow behind the engine cover, if you can still get to it behind the suits there. We can't give you a permanent location, because we don't have the c.g. yet, without the rest of the rocks.
127:17:24|T|CDR|Understand. It doesn't make much difference right now.
127:17:27|C|Eng|Okay.  Hey, I thought you might be interested up there all the orbital science is working fine. The only problem Ken's had is with the laser altimeter. It only keys about 80 percent of the time, so he's losing about 20 percent of the data, but it's still working fine, and everything else is outstanding.
127:18:39|T|CDR|Yeah, well what's he say Descartes made out of?
127:18:45|C|Eng|Okay, that's a -
127:18:46|T|LMP|Is he getting it in real time like he did last time?
127:18:48|C|Eng|I'll get back there and find out. I'll get back up to you with that.
127:18:55|T|LMP|I was just curious as to what the sensors were saying about our area right here.
127:19:00|C|Eng|Yeah, I'd like to know that, too.
127:20:32|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
127:20:33|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
127:20:38|T|LMP|Okay. We just picked up a pretty high-pitched hum in the ECS loop. Would you have them take a look?
127:20:46|C|Eng|Okay. We'll do that.  Okay, Orion, we have High Bit Rate, and we don't see anything out of the ordinary right now.
127:21:47|T|LMP|Okay. Thank you.
127:21:51|C|Eng|Incidentally, whenever you happen to get your data book there, I have some new block data for you.
127:22:01|T|CDR|That'll be a while, Tony.
127:22:03|C|Eng|Okay. No hurry.
127:25:40|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. John's taking his PGA off .
127:25:44|C|Eng|Okay.
127:26:06|T|LMP|In fact, Tony, I think this high-pitched hum is how the loop should sound, if I remember our chamber test. This is exactly what it sounds like, and it hadn't been doing that .
127:45:46|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. I'm up on comm. How do you read? Over.
127:45:49|C|Eng|Okay. You're 5 by there, John.
127:45:56|T|LMP|Okay. Coming <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="alsj">out of my suit</a>, now, Tony.
127:45:59|C|Eng|Okay.
128:12:31|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're ready for the 'EVA debriefing with Houston' , and lift-off time - I guess we can take that, too, if we can find the Data Book.
128:12:41|C|Eng|Okay, fine. Why don't we just give you all the housekeeping right now?  Charlie, when you're ready -
128:12:49|T|LMP|Okay.
128:12:50|C|Eng|- we can give you the battery management .
128:12:59|T|CDR|Okay, go ahead with that. Charlie's all ears.
128:13:02|C|Eng|Okay. If you'll read us the ED voltages.
128:13:13|T|LMP|It's amazing, but they're still 37 volts.
128:13:16|C|Eng|Well, that's encouraging. Okay, we'd like the Lunar Battery to the CDR's Bus. Battery 3 and 4, Off. Batteries 1 and 2, On.
128:13:28|T|LMP|Okay. I won't do it in that sequence, but I know what you want.
128:13:34|C|Eng|Okay, fine. Okay, the battery management on 3-3 will get you there.
128:13:58|T|LMP|Okay, you got it. Batts 1 and 2 are On. Batts 3 and 4 are Off. And the Luny Batt is Commander.
128:14:06|C|Eng|Good show. And looks good here.
128:14:15|C|Eng|And do you want this block data?
128:14:20|T|CDR|Ready to copy.
128:14:22|C|Eng|Okay. It's LM lift-off, LM Timeline Book. T-28, plus 21 plus 08. T-29, 130 plus 19 plus 49. T-30, 132 plus 18 plus 22. 131 , 134 plus 16 plus 54; T-32, 136 plus 15 plus 27. T-33, 138 plus 15 plus 20. And that's it.
128:15:21|T|CDR|Okay. Give me 31 again, Tony.
128:15:24|C|Eng|Okay, T-31, 134 plus 16 plus 54.
128:15:35|T|CDR|Okay. Starting with T-29, 130 plus 19 plus 49; 132 plus 18 plus 22; 134 plus 16 plus 54; 136 plus 15 plus 27; 138 plus 15 plus 20, through 33.
128:15:58|C|Eng|Okay, readback's good. And, we have some changes to your Surface Checklist.   3-5.
128:16:14|T|CDR|Roger. What page did you say, again?
128:16:17|C|Eng|3-5.
128:16:21|T|CDR|Roger.
128:16:25|C|Eng|Okay -
128:16:26|T|LMP|You speak.
128:17:08|T|CDR|Okay.
128:17:09|C|Eng|Okay. At the top of the second column there, the PLSS O2 and H2O recharge is 129 plus 20; go ahead and do that. And the rest of the page, go ahead and do.
128:17:25|T|LMP|Okay!
128:17:27|C|Eng|Okay. On the next page, 3-6, the Pre-sleep is at 129 plus 50.
128:17:41|T|LMP|Okay.
128:17:42|C|Eng|And the rest period begins at 130 plus 15. That's the bottom line, second column.
128:17:53|T|LMP|Okay; 130:15. Do you want us to bring up the computer ? Over.
128:18:00|C|Eng|Negative.
128:18:03|T|LMP|Okay, we'll still skip that.
128:18:05|C|Eng|Rog. And it'll be an 8-hour sleep period, and I don't have the morning's checklist yet. I'm trying to get that for you tonight so we won't have any updates in the morning. Get your cue - We'll get your cue card, too, tonight.
128:18:21|T|CDR|That'll be kind of you, Tony.
128:18:24|C|Eng|Okay, now I just have some questions -
128:18:27|T|LMP|That ought to be pretty nominal, Tony.
128:18:28|C|Eng|Yeah, we're looking right now at a completely nominal -
128:18:30|T|LMP|Hey, let me ask you -
128:18:33|C|Eng|completely nominal EVA-2, and the day will probably be 2 hours longer , so you have - It's kind of a relaxed day. We'll have some time to sit around and talk in the evening. And we're still looking beyond there, but things look pretty good. And your biomed looks great down here. Just keep up the orange juice.  push on it a little bit there and everything will be fine.
128:18:58|T|CDR|Push on the orange juice and everything will be fine?
128:19:02|C|Eng|Yeah, push on the orange juice. Rog.
128:19:04|T|CDR|I'm going to turn into a citrus product is what I'm gonna do.
128:19:09|C|Eng|Oh, well; it's good for you, John.
128:19:15|T|CDR|Ever hear of acid stomach, Tony?
128:19:17|C|Eng|Well, I don't know about that. Also, since tomorrow's pretty relaxed, we encourage you to get a lot of sleep tonight. You've got plenty of time; no need to feel like you've got to press in the morning.
128:19:30|T|CDR|Okay, and I think I've got a pH factor going for about 3 right now.
128:19:36|C|Eng|Okay
128:19:38|T|LMP|Okay -
128:19:39|C|Eng|We'll give you a buffer when you get down.
128:19:41|T|LMP|Okay, Tony -
128:19:42|T|CDR|Because of the orange juice.  Yeah.
128:19:44|T|LMP|I'd like to ask a couple of questions about consumable status, how we look for EVA-3, and what kind of day EVA-3 would be. Preliminary plans. Over.
128:20:06|C|Eng|Okay. We've got a whole general plan here. And I'd like to send that up to you later, if that's okay.
128:20:16|T|CDR|That's fine. And I'd like to get some information on what we did today, in terms of how the PLSS worked, and how our metabolic rates were, and how - That sort of thing.
128:20:31|C|Eng|Okay, understand. We'll get them to work on that. And whenever you're ready, I can start sending up these questions from -
128:20:42|T|LMP|Then let's have your debriefing.
128:20:44|C|Eng|Yeah, right - from the back room.
128:20:51|T|CDR|We're ready as we'll ever be.
128:20:53|C|Eng|Okay. There was one here, just use of words that we had a question on. When you armed the mortar package, you described all three pins are pulled. I read that to mean that you'd pulled the horse collar there and armed the two switches. Is that right?
128:21:11|T|CDR|That is affirmative.
128:21:14|C|Eng|Okay, now on to the geology.
128:21:16|T|CDR|She 's all ready to go.
128:21:40|T|LMP|That's all I saw. There are some more blocks than that scattered, I think, around the landing area, Tony.
128:21:51|T|CDR|Yeah, and, Tony, Charlie's idea to make this area LM 10 - I mean, to make this Stop 10 is a pretty good one. There's plenty to get around here.
128:21:59|C|Eng|Okay, we understand. You said that the rocks in this area look different from what you saw . About how far west did that difference go?
128:22:11|T|CDR|There you go. I was just - At zero phase, I just hang on to the Rover and try to see where the next hole is.
128:22:21|C|Eng|That's called passing the buck.
128:22:22|T|LMP|Well, let me say, Tony, that the -
128:22:25|T|CDR|That's not passing the buck, Tony. There's no way you can look down there when you're driving and see any - You can't even see the craters, much less the
128:22:34|C|Eng|We understand, John, the point you make.
128:22:36|T|CDR|- what kind of rock's they are.  Okay.
128:22:41|T|LMP|Well, let me give it a try, Tony. I always have an opinion. The rocks around the - beyond the ALSEP on our drive out past Spook and Buster, all had this breccia appearance to them, with the primarily grayish matrix with a dark clast. At Buster, though, there were some rocks that were very shocked, I think. In fact, they just crumbled in my hand - the one I picked up. So, at least at Buster and Spook, the rocks appear to be different, in the main, than they are right here. Over.
128:23:32|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. Of the rocks you saw, do you feel like you sampled all the representative types?
128:23:45|T|LMP|Well, out there at Flag, they were all so dust covered, I don't know. I was really surprised when John broke that big boulder open and saw that whitish matrix with the clasts. I frankly don't think that was a breccia, but it was a pretty friable rock, anyway.
128:24:07|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. You first described the Muley rock as a crystalline and then switched to a - Correction. You first described it as a breccia, then switched to crystalline. I wonder if you could have some third or fourth thoughts on that?
128:24:34|T|LMP|Well, I'd say when I picked it up, it was pretty dust covered, and only had a couple of spots that I could look. One area looked like a crystalline rock. There was a - If it were a breccia, then that clast is pretty large, a centimeter or so. If it's a crystalline rock, then it's a sort of a feldspar-looking type crystal. The other - When I turned it over, it had another one of those white specks that most of the breccias have around here, and that's when I switched. So it could be a combination, Tony.
128:25:21|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.  Okay. Can you give us a numerical estimate on the proportion of the rock types in the LM area? We wonder if there's any correlation between rock type, size, shape, or angularity.
128:25:53|T|CDR|Well, there probably really isn't a correlation like that. I was just looking out the window here. I see some very angular rocks that are white rocks. And some more grayish rocks - in other words, less white in them - that are sort of subrounded -
128:26:38|C|Eng|Okay. Does that correlate with sizes?
128:26:39|T|CDR|- and some rocks that are -  No, these are all about the same size - No, the big whities are - It's just not going to be that correlatable. I see some that's sitting out there in the middle of the LM area that look like, I swear, they got some pinks in them. Pink with black clasts in them, laying across on the way to ALSEP site. And, seemingly, you can almost say they came from South Ray if you're a betting man. And these big ones - Those seem to be predominantly the size of, oh say, 20-centimeter rocks, and they're very angular. The white rocks are also - They're smaller. They're on the order of 10 to 15 centimeters. I'm just guessing because we're sitting right here in the middle of this thing, and it's sort of like we can't see the forest for the trees. They seem to be a smaller rock, maybe 6 - no - 6 to 12 centimeters, very angular. And they're probably less than 5 percent of the rock type. The predominant rock in the area is just an old gray, subrounded, angular rock. And I would guess that's a breccia of some type. And although the surface is very boulder-strewn, as you probably noticed on the television, it looks exactly, at the ALSEP site and here, at the same amount of boulders. I guess we put the thing in the same ray almost, because it 's almost on a line from here to South Ray. I guess what I'm saying is I can see what I believe to be at least three different rock types out here. The white, the pinkish - and this is from the LM so I'm really not qualified to go into that - the pinkish with the black clast in it, and the subrounded gray rock.
128:29:18|C|Eng|Okay. Have we sampled all three of those?
128:29:24|T|CDR|No, we haven't done any sampling around the LM or around the ALSEP site!
128:29:31|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. I understood that; I just wondered if you had picked up anything that you thought was the pink with the black specks anywhere?
128:29:41|T|CDR|I think most of the rocks that I was with Charlie, when he was picking up, except for that one that we beat off over there , they're all dust covered predominantly, and I never got a chance to look at them.
128:29:51|C|Eng|Okay, I understand.  So generally -
128:29:57|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, I'd like to give you a what I -
128:30:01|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
128:30:02|T|LMP|Let me say something, Tony, here. I'd like to give you what I think are the three major areas that we saw today. One, here at the LM, I'm convinced is a ray from South Ray. The rock types being predominantly from there. Over by Flag, we were out of that ray. We were in the Cayley, and I sampled on the rim of Buster. And whatever made Buster - I don't think it was a secondary, because I think the rocks that we picked up there were true shocked rocks. And I just can't see a secondary doing that. So the rocks around there, we were definitely out of the ray at Buster and Flag - Excuse me. At Buster and Spook. At Flag and Plum, we're again into Cayley with hardly any blocks visible. So you have a Cayley without the blocks fartherest out. You have the Cayley with the blocks that, I think, are some of the stuff that was made from Buster on the rim, and then in here towards the LM, we have the South Ray.
128:31:27|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds good, Charlie.
128:31:30|T|CDR|Yeah, I think Charlie's right about that.
128:31:35|C|Eng|Okay. In your summary there, you answered a whole mess of my questions here. I got to slide down the list and find one you haven't answered.  Okay. How about that albedo change in the subsurface soil that you talked about? It seemed like - course, you saw it first time at Flag and were probably more excited about it there. Was there any difference in its nature between there and Buster and ALSEP and LM?
128:32:10|T|LMP|No. Only around the LM, there was just - and the ALSEP - it was just in spots. At Buster, it - Correction. At Plum, it seemed to be everywhere and - Everywhere we dug a little scoop.  My predominant impression was that the white albedo was coarser grained than the fine-dust cover on top.
128:32:41|C|Eng|Okay. The white is coarser.
128:32:46|T|LMP|That's affirm. It looks sort of - I'm not going to say ash flow, but it sure looked like it was coarse, white - Let me get a better word. Let me think about that one for a description.
128:33:04|C|Eng|Okay.
128:33:06|C|Eng|Okay, just a question now for you, John. When you got to Halfway or what you decided was Halfway, we understand you looped around the south, is that right?
128:33:19|T|CDR|That's affirm.
128:33:23|C|Eng|In any of the craters that you looked into -
128:33:26|T|CDR|Yeah, we came up on Plum from -
128:33:28|C|Eng|Okay. In any of the craters that you looked into, was there any evidence of outcrops in the walls? You mentioned the one boulder that was sticking out the side of Flag, I think it was. Was there any other evidence of - Any bedrock? Any ledges?
128:33:47|T|CDR|Did you see any in Buster?  Charlie didn't see any, and I didn't see any.
128:33:51|C|Eng|Okay. No benches in any of these craters at all -
128:33:53|T|CDR|No, these were very subdued -  No, these were rather subdued craters. They do have rocks sticking out of them, particularly at Buster, and there was a few at Flag. But the rest of them really didn't. The deceptive part of the whole business, you know, is you can't really tell by looking at a crater how big it is. I was almost willing to buy Halfway for being Flag.
128:34:26|C|Eng|Okay, we understand.
128:34:27|T|CDR|It's a long way from being Flag-Crater size.
128:34:31|T|LMP|Tony, let me try again. The larger craters, the old subdued ones, were boulder free. The only hint that I had was this northeast-southwest boulder distribution in Buster. And that went sort of up the wall southwest to northeast. Over.
128:35:10|C|Eng|Right; understand. I guess that's why went ahead and called it a secondary. It probably isn't, since it was oriented with the structure of the area.
128:35:23|T|LMP|Man, that was a big rock that came in there, if that was a secondary. I'll tell you, that is a <i>big</i> crater. The walls on it are - Well, the east wall was still in shadow to some degree with whatever our Sun angle is now; and we couldn't see in the bottom of Flag or Spook. We just couldn't get up close enough to the rim to see into the bottom.
128:35:50|C|Eng|Okay, from the TV there, a couple of times when you were walking around those rims, I was wishing we had that rescue lanyard.
128:36:02|T|CDR|Too late now, there, Tony.
128:36:05|C|Eng|Rog.
128:36:08|T|CDR|We'll have to count on Charlie being able to crawl out of any hole he gets in.
128:36:15|C|Eng|Okay, we're looking -
128:36:16|T|LMP|When I fell down over there by the ALSEP, I crawled into one to stand up.
128:36:26|C|Eng|How was the footing, trying to climb out of those? The little ones?
128:36:33|T|LMP|It's a piece of cake on those little 10-meter size.
128:36:37|C|Eng|Okay.   On this Station 10, we're perhaps considering beefing it up, and letting you do some sampling in that area. And from what you've been saying now, it sounds like you think that the LM-ALSEP area would be a good place to spend some time. You think from your experience with the drill there, you could drive the double core all right? And how does a rake sample in that area look?
128:37:08|T|CDR|Yeah, we can get a lot of rocks in a rake sample.  Charlie says the double core will go.
128:37:18|C|Eng|We're thinking about maybe moving 10 a little bit away, to get out of the LM descent and the peeling paint on the LM and all this kind of stuff. So from what you've been saying, if that's a ray, it should be okay to move to the south-southwest.
128:37:37|T|CDR|What peeling paint on the LM?
128:37:41|C|Eng|Oh, your ablated paint on the top.
128:37:43|T|CDR|Man, that LM looks good from the outside. She looks good from the outside. All that paint's gone away.
128:37:49|C|Eng|Okay; understand.
128:37:52|T|CDR|There's still a little bit out there.
128:37:56|C|Eng|Okay, a question here on the cosmic ray . When the red ring came off, did it bring the whole cable with it?
128:38:10|T|CDR|No, it brought about 3 inches with it.
128:38:16|C|Eng|Okay. Did you happen to notice if there was a 1-1/2-inch hole visible in the upper, left-hand corner of the upper panel?
128:38:31|T|CDR|A 1-1/2-inch hole visible in the upper, left-hand corner of the upper panel.
128:38:37|C|Eng|I know. I wouldn't have noticed; but the question's here. I thought you just might have seen it.
128:38:44|T|CDR|Well, there was a bunch of squares and different samples in the upper panel, but I guess everybody knows that. But, you say, we would have made a 1-1/2-inch hole in the whole business?
128:39:00|C|Eng|No, you wouldn't have made the hole, but it would have shown it.
128:39:01|T|CDR|I can look at it tomorrow.  We can find out when we're passing by the Y strut tomorrow.
128:39:09|C|Eng|Okay. After you pulled the red ring off, was there any cable hanging out the bottom of the cosmic ray experiment? I mean, was there any of that string left? What I'm wondering is, did the string break?
128:39:23|T|CDR|Just a minute. I looked at the top of the panel . It did look like the thing had jammed up in there. Some of the Mylar in the top section was crinkled in a funny way, like it had been pulled down on it. And that was the only abnormal thing I noticed about it.
128:39:48|C|Eng|Could you estimate how far it moved before the thing broke?
128:39:58|T|CDR|Yeah. At least 3 inches. How far does it have to move?
128:40:07|C|Eng|As long as you get any movement at all, it should be all right.
128:40:13|T|CDR|That's what I figured. I think it moved some.  I mean -
128:40:19|C|Eng|Okay. That should give them enough information to think about back there.  We're curious about the position of the UV camera. We saw it on TV, but it was pretty hard to get an exact location. Could you estimate how many feet down-Sun from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> footpad, and I understand it's right next to the edge of the shadow?
128:40:58|T|CDR|Okay.  Right now, the camera is about, I would say, from the center of the Z-footpad - I mean the plus-X footpad - to the center of the bottom of the camera is about 4-1/2 or 5 feet.
128:41:31|C|Eng|Okay. Now, that is directly to the camera, or is that in the down-Sun direction?
128:41:38|T|CDR|That is in the down-Sun direction.
128:41:41|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
128:41:43|T|CDR|In the Y distance, the distance to the camera is about, oh, maybe 5 feet. Up from the Z strut out to the camera, it may be 6 feet. And it looks like to me that the Sun has got to move - I'm not so sure we're not going to have to move the camera to keep it in the shade, if the Sun is going to move another 20 or 30 degrees while we're here.
128:42:28|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. The Sun looks like it's coming down on the top of it?
128:42:36|T|CDR|No, the Sun is not coming down on top of it.
128:42:40|C|Eng|No, I didn't mean -
128:42:42|T|CDR|The shadow has got to move -  The shadow has got to move in, oh, about 12 feet before it gets into the LM or - That's hard for me to tell from right here.
128:42:57|C|Eng|Okay. I understand, John.
128:42:59|T|CDR|But I set it up like that picture in the book .
128:43:04|C|Eng|Rog.  Okay. One more geology question here. Was there any difference between the rocks in the bottom of Buster and those on the rim of Buster?
128:43:28|T|LMP|You want me to guess, Tony? I don't think so.
128:43:32|C|Eng|Okay, you're right.  That's all you can do.
128:43:38|T|LMP|Okay. And the reason I don't think so is that the rocks in the bottom were all shattered and crumbly looking and sort of mounds of rocks with many fractures in them, which was just like the one I sampled that crumbled up in my hand. So, texturally, from 50 meters, they look the same.
128:44:04|C|Eng|Okay, fine. That's the end. Do you have any comments on the geology?
128:44:16|T|CDR|We didn't do enough of it.
128:44:32|T|CDR|Who's in the Backroom, now? Is Dale and Lee and Bill Muehlberger back there?
128:44:38|C|Eng|Yeah, I saw Dale and Lee. I didn't see - Correction: I saw Dale and Bill; I didn't see Lee. I think he's on the planning team .
128:44:47|T|CDR|Okay.
128:45:35|T|CDR|I don't think we've got a problem, either, if I can figure a way to keep pulling it every time I get in and out of the Rover. If I can't do that, why, we'll just keep putting it back in.
128:45:49|C|Eng|Okay. We'll investigate it tonight; and we'll make a recommendation, if necessary, during the EVA prep tomorrow.
128:45:59|T|CDR|Okay.
128:46:00|C|Eng|Maybe we'll put a lanyard on the pin or something.
128:46:04|T|CDR|Oh, Tony, now.
128:46:06|C|Eng|I'm just reading it.
128:46:10|C|Eng|Okay. The LMP had depleted both the primary and secondary water tanks, and the CDR had approximately 2 hours remaining. And the LMP's O2 use rate was higher than expected due to high metabolic rate. CDR's O2 rate was nominal.
128:46:35|T|CDR|No, mine was lower than expected.
128:46:42|C|Eng|Okay. The medics agree.
128:46:44|T|LMP|I tell you, I expended about a thousand of those when I fell down.
128:46:52|C|Eng|Rog. You were really puffing away, there.
128:46:58|T|LMP|Well, you got to get up.
128:46:59|C|Eng|You're right. Good idea.  Okay. That's about all I've got except for the plans for the next couple of days, and I guess I don't have them quite yet. We'll get those to you later. Why don't you go ahead and eat.  If you haven't done so already.
128:47:18|T|CDR|That's in work.
128:47:32|T|LMP|Yeah. It's the one we're eating right now, and it's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM11Menu.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">day 5, meal C</a>, and it was back there in the food compartment. And it was in there in its little bag; and the thing just sort of came loose and everything floated out. Each little sample is not - the vacuum is not gone on it. It's okay. I mean, each part of it. It must have been the overbag or something .
128:48:03|C|Eng|Okay; I copy that.  Great. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. The day went so fast today, the first thing I knew, I didn't have a chance to eat or get a cup of coffee or anything. It was really fun along here. Doggone exciting.
128:48:26|T|CDR|Well, it was pretty interesting. I think we'll do a little better on the driving cross-Sun tomorrow.
128:48:31|C|Eng|Rog. You made good time coming back.
128:48:37|T|CDR|Well, follow your tracks. That's the only way to fly.
128:48:43|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. If we were on time, and we got our 7-hour EVA in, how come we cut down? Where did we lose - We must have lost it somewhere because we only had half the time at Flag - or Spook, rather.
128:49:03|T|CDR|Yeah, I was a little curious about that, too.
128:49:06|C|Eng|Okay. We got out of Flag about 10 minutes late, really, by the time you're really all loaded up and moving. And I can't remember right now where we lost the rest of the time.
128:49:48|C|Eng|Okay. And I sure think it's paying off. You guys do an outstanding job.
128:50:00|T|CDR|Yeah. You noticed how good I carry the bags, huh?   -  be that way.
128:50:37|T|CDR|I have the farts, again. I got them again, Charlie. I don't know what the hell gives them to me. Certainly not - I think it's acid stomach. I really do.
128:50:44|T|LMP|It probably is.
128:50:45|T|CDR|I mean, I haven't eaten this much citrus fruit in 20 years! And I'll tell you one thing, in another 12 fucking days, I ain't never eating any more. And if they offer to sup me potassium with my breakfast, I'm going to throw up!  I like an occasional orange. Really do.  But I'll be durned if I'm going to be buried in oranges.
128:51:13|T|LMP|you really played it easy today. I wish I'd stayed out another hour.
128:51:25|T|CDR|I knew all that stuff you were doing would make you work hard.
128:51:28|T|LMP|It seemed like -
128:51:30|T|CDR|Well, I don't know what the hell I was doing. You did most of my work. You unloaded the ETB and loaded the ETB and all that stuff.
128:51:40|T|LMP|loading and unloading. You know why? I got back here. You were - I'll tell you what it was. We never practiced that part before of arming the mortar package.
128:51:53|T|CDR|Yeah.
128:51:54|T|LMP|While I get back - You see, I usually stand around in training playing around and drink. And so, I got back here to the LM, golly, I had SWC out, went out there to pick up that rock, and that's the only reason - because I'd keep running back in.
128:52:42|T|LMP|About 20 minutes before I woke you up, we had a site handover that dropped the up-link - - got a whiff of that turkey and gravy -
128:53:16|T|CDR|What'd I do with them?
128:53:20|T|LMP|What did you do with them?
128:53:21|T|CDR|They're right there over the -  Well, they're gone. I put them up over the - Right up in here. They ain't there? Oh, shit. Must be on the floor, then. Is all that ripped open or something, Charlie?
128:53:47|T|Allen|Orion, Houston.
128:53:53|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
128:53:58|C|Eng|Okay, John. We have a hot mike.
128:54:07|T|CDR|How long have we had that?
128:54:10|C|Eng|Okay. It's been on through the debriefing.
128:54:28|T|CDR|How could we be on hot mike with Normal Voice?
128:54:48|C|Eng|John, how do you have your intercom set up?
128:55:04|T|CDR|I'm in S-Band to T/R, ICS to T/R, Relay is Off, Mode is ICS/PTT, Audio Control is Normal, VHF A is Receive, VHF B is Off.
128:55:31|C|Eng|John, would you exercise your Push-To-Talk button there? It may be stuck.
128:55:48|T|CDR|-
128:55:59|C|Eng|John, it doesn't seem to be a hot mike now. Evidently, you got it off.
128:56:15|T|CDR|Okay. Fine.
128:57:21|T|Slayton|Hello, John. How do you read?
128:57:34|T|CDR|Loud and clear. How do you read? Over.
128:58:22|T|CDR|Okay. Fine.
128:58:25|T|Slayton|And we hope you're going to get lots of rest here tonight. You've got plenty of time to do it, and, of course, with only two meals a day, why, you ought to be hungry enough to push the heck out of that. But as long as you're feeling good, why, everybody will be real happy down here, and you go as far as you feel like going.
128:58:44|T|CDR|That's what we're doing.
128:58:46|T|Slayton|Rog.
128:59:26|C|Eng|And fellas, I'll see you all in the morning. Have a good sleep.
128:59:32|T|CDR|Thank you.
129:00:46|T|Slayton|Orion, Houston.
129:00:52|T|LMP|Go ahead.
129:00:53|T|Slayton|Roger. Just wanted to confirm that you guys are recharging the PLSSs . We're showing a little high water usage and assumed that was the case.
129:01:03|T|LMP|No, we're not. We were just drinking a lot. We're filling <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="alsj">drink bags</a>, juice bags, and food, Houston.
129:01:21|T|Slayton|Okay, fine. We're just a little ginchy down here based on previous experience with a leak.
129:01:32|T|LMP|Well, we just looked back in the back to try to find a lost item, and we looked all through the back end. And there's some condensation on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a> side, but there's no leaks back there.
129:01:52|T|Slayton|Okay, everybody's happy.  Orion, if we're not disturbing your dinner there, would you comment on whether you found anything that accounted for that hot-mike situation a while back?
129:02:35|T|LMP|Well, unless it was a stuck mike button. That's the only thing we can think of because our comm configuration was normal.
129:02:45|T|Slayton|Okay.
129:02:52|T|LMP|Sorry about that; but it's terrible being on a hot mike here sometimes.
129:02:56|T|Slayton|Well, you guys have done commendably well, considering the fact that you didn't know you were on it. I'm very happy with your -
129:03:09|T|LMP|Thank you.
129:03:15|T|Slayton|I wish we could say the same for some of the people down here.
129:03:25|T|LMP|Yeah.
129:11:08|T|LMP|Houston, we getting ready to start the PLSS O2 and H2O recharge . It's an hour passed since our initial O2 recharge? Over.
129:11:24|T|Slayton|Rog. Go ahead.
129:11:32|T|LMP|You're clipping a little bit. Say again.
129:11:34|T|Slayton|Roger. Go ahead. You're clear.
129:11:36|T|LMP|Thank you.
129:18:10|T|LMP|Okay; Houston. We're gonna start the water recharge right now.
129:18:14|T|Slayton|Okay.
129:19:36|T|LMP|Okay; we've started the water fill. Give us a hack at 5 minutes, please, Houston.
129:19:40|T|Slayton|Roger. Will do.
129:23:51|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
129:23:53|T|Slayton|Go ahead, Orion. Houston here.
129:23:55|T|LMP|Rog. If all goes according to schedule on this plan you sent up, what would be our total lunar surface stay time?
129:24:07|T|Slayton|About 19 hours.  Oh, you're talking about surface stay time. I'm sorry; I'm giving you EVA time. Well, hang on a second. We'll have to figure that one out.
129:24:28|T|LMP|Appreciate it, boss.
129:24:31|T|Slayton|Okay, thank you.
129:24:51|T|Slayton|Okay, Charlie. You've got 5 minutes ; and your total lunar surface time would be about 71 hours, in round numbers.
129:25:07|T|LMP|Thank you, boss.
129:25:09|T|Slayton|Roger.
130:01:18|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie's charging his PLSS with water, and he just started 5 minutes about 5 second ago.
130:01:34|T|Slayton|Rog.
130:01:37|T|CDR|Can you keep time on that for us, Houston?
130:01:41|T|Slayton|Rog. Got her running.
130:01:45|T|CDR|Okay.  What is this water problem that Charlie's telling me you think we've got? Should we start looking for leaks?
130:01:59|T|Slayton|No. Relax on that, John. They just noticed a higher than normal usage and, you know, we had that leak - I guess it was on 15 - that we discovered there when people were resting. Just wanted to make sure that you weren't doing something that was using high usage.
130:02:19|T|CDR|Okay. We were drinking plenty of it, I'll tell you that.
130:02:26|T|Slayton|Well, it's good for you.  How's the temperature on it? Does it taste pretty good?
130:02:34|T|CDR|Yeah, it's pretty good.  Yeah, it's good water. It really is.
130:02:44|T|Slayton|Great.
130:02:47|T|LMP|I never thought water had a flavor to it, but this has really got a good flavor.
130:02:51|T|Slayton|That's that good high-calorie iodine in it that does that for you.
130:02:58|T|CDR|That's probably what we really need.
130:03:08|T|Slayton|Yeah, you guys earned a good shot, there, today. Wish we had something a little stronger to give you .
130:03:20|T|LMP|You just keep it on the cooler, boss. We'll be back and take you up on that.
130:03:24|T|Slayton|Okay.
130:03:27|T|CDR|I'll tell you that's really a nice place to work, once you get out in the open like that. That is <i>really</i> something.
130:03:39|T|Slayton|Yeah, that was pretty impressive. Looked real great on the TV, and you guys did a real beautiful job there.  Looks like you were lucky to find a place big enough to land in.
130:04:02|T|CDR|Yeah, I've got second thoughts, right now, as to whether or not that was luck or skill. I thought it was being pretty skillful because I could see all the way to the ground and then we got out - And I noticed that we were kind of close to a crater, so I went forward a little. Then we got out and, shoot, we hadn't landed more than about 10 feet beyond this big thing.
130:04:32|T|Slayton|That's pure skill and cunning, John.
130:04:34|T|CDR|And it -  That's right. I didn't realize we'd come in so close to it. I think I was backing up just a hair before we landed. Although the probes seem to have broke straight up and down.
130:04:52|T|Slayton|Rog. Sounds like you had essentially no velocity, except vertical.
130:05:06|T|LMP|And, Deke, the landing didn't seem that hard, but we must have stroked the gear. The bell is about 10 inches off - less than that - about 4 or 5 inches off the ground. But the MESA was sitting right on the ground! We had to pick it way up, and the ALSEP was less than eye level, really, .
130:05:24|T|Slayton|Well, it could be our simulation isn't all that good, either.
130:05:33|T|LMP|That's true.
130:06:32|T|Slayton|Okay, we got the 5 minutes on your PLSS there.
130:06:42|T|CDR|Rog. Thank you. I just did that so the guys on the ground would know when we were using this water this much.
130:06:51|T|Slayton|Rog. Good idea.
130:06:53|T|CDR|And we've completed the charges of both PLSSs now.
130:06:57|T|Slayton|Roger.
130:07:08|T|CDR|Re-schedule another EVA in 2 or 3 hours here.
130:07:11|T|Slayton|Well, if you're ready to run, we could probably work that out in about an hour or so.
130:07:22|T|CDR|It's amazing how much better you feel once you sit around for a couple of hours afterwards. Boy, when we got in, we were pretty well convinced that we couldn't do a heck of a lot more, but I think - It's just like any other training exercise. Once you sit around for a couple of hours, you're ready to go again. I think we are.
130:07:43|T|Slayton|Rog. Well, we got a nice casual schedule from here, so you might as well power down and get a good 8 hours of snoozing. You'll really feel like it in the morning.
130:07:54|T|CDR|That's what we're going to do.
130:08:00|T|Slayton|How are the fingers feeling at this point? A little better?
130:08:09|T|CDR|Yeah. It wasn't my fingers so much as my knuckles. I don't really understand it; but it's going to be very interesting to see what I can do with them.
130:08:23|T|Slayton|Rog.
130:18:47|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. Whose biomed do you want to watch tonight?
130:18:58|T|Slayton|Stand by one.  Okay, biomed on the right-hand side, Charlie.
130:19:25|T|LMP|Okay, you going to watch me again tonight?
130:19:29|T|Slayton|Yeah, you apparently paint a pretty picture for them. They like you.
130:19:36|T|LMP|Okay.
130:21:50|T|Slayton|Okay, fine. Yeah, I don't think there wasn't anything magic about our input there.
130:22:05|T|CDR|Yeah, he got good sleep last night, as a matter of fact, and so did I.
130:22:10|T|Slayton|Roger. That's correct. We agree.
130:22:20|T|LMP|Couldn't ever believe we'd go to sleep, Deke; but, man, this guy John sleeps like a baby up here. I've never seen it.
130:22:31|T|Slayton|It sounds like the best place in the world to sleep. I wish I was with you.
130:22:43|T|LMP|We do, too, boss.
130:24:43|T|Slayton|Orion; Houston.
130:24:48|T|LMP|Go ahead.
130:24:49|T|Slayton|Rog. We've got a short Flight Plan update for tomorrow. There are some miscellaneous items if you want to go ahead and take them now.
130:25:01|T|LMP|Stand by about 20 seconds.
130:25:03|T|Slayton|Okay.
130:25:34|T|LMP|Go ahead.
130:26:04|T|LMP|Okay.
130:26:06|T|Slayton|Okay, and then add that line down further on the page where it says &quot;Stow in ETB&quot;. Add &quot;1 - HCEX Mag B&quot;.
130:26:29|T|LMP|Okay. Copy.
130:26:30|T|Slayton|Okay. On the leftside page about halfway down, where you have &quot;Books for revs 25 through 31&quot;, that is now &quot;34 to 39&quot;. And the two lines below that, I believe, have already been deleted, but double-check that.
130:26:51|T|LMP|Okay, 34 to 39, and you're right, Deke. We already deleted that.
130:26:58|T|Slayton: Okay.  Now, on <a href="a16surf3-8_9.jpg"title="image" target="new">page 3-8</a>, right-hand side, halfway down. Delete two lines|&quot;Change <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">LM ECS</a>, lithium hydroxide cartridge&quot;; and the one below it, &quot;Stow used cartridge with BSLSS Bag&quot;.
130:27:18|T|LMP|Okay.
130:27:20|T|Slayton: Okay, and 3-9|delete the whole page.
130:27:30|T|LMP|We got it. Go ahead.
130:27:32|T|Slayton|Okay. 4-3. Get your EVA-2 prep card on this one, and we'll enter those all on that page.
130:27:48|T|LMP|Stand by.
130:27:49|T|Slayton|Okay.
130:28:19|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
130:28:20|T|Slayton|Okay. On the right side of the card, in the middle, after Comm . These are all add-ons. There's about six line items of add-on under there, which we have fit on our card. You'll have to start up above that column to do it. First is &quot;S-Band Mod PM.&quot;
130:28:47|T|LMP|Okay, keep reading them.
130:28:48|T|Slayton|Okay.
130:28:49|T|LMP|I got that, &quot;S-Band PM.&quot;
130:28:50|T|Slayton|Okay. Next, &quot;Transmitter/Receiver, Secondary;  Power Amp, Secondary;  Voice, Down-Voice Backup;  PCM, PCM;  Range, Off.&quot;  Okay, then down about five lines there, TLM Biomed, where it says &quot;Off&quot;, should be &quot;Left&quot;, and three lines below there, where it says &quot;Recorder, On&quot;, should be &quot;Off&quot;.
130:29:45|T|LMP|Okay, copy. &quot;S-Band to PM; Power Amp to Secondary; Transmitter/Receiver, Secondary; Down Voice Backup; PCM to PCM; Ranging Off; Telemetry, Left; and Recorder, scratch.&quot;
130:30:02|T|Slayton|Affirmative. Okay, next change is 5-3.  And on 5-3, right-hand column, battery management. Delete that whole column.
130:30:22|T|LMP|Okay, deleted.
130:30:23|T|Slayton|Rog. Okay, page 5-4. Left column, bottom of the page, the last two lines. Delete &quot;TLM PCM - LO&quot;, and &quot;S-Band Voice Down to Voice Backup&quot;.
130:30:39|T|LMP|Copy.
130:30:40|T|Slayton: Okay.  Then on the bottom of the right-hand side, three lines up from the bottom|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return </a>, where it is &quot;Auto&quot;, change to &quot;Open&quot;.
130:30:55|T|LMP|Copy.
130:30:56|T|Slayton|Okay, page 5-5, middle left-hand column. Delete &quot;Stow LM ECS lithium hydroxide in bracket aft of engine cover&quot;. And bottom of the page -
130:31:10|T|LMP|Rog. Go.
130:31:11|T|Slayton|Rog. Bottom of the page, where it's &quot;Rev 32-36&quot;, should now be &quot;Revs 40 to 45&quot;.  Okay, next change is -
130:31:25|T|LMP|Go ahead.
130:31:26|T|Slayton|Okay, next change is 5-6, bottom of the page. Below &quot;MCC-H Conference&quot;, add &quot;153:45; change LM ECS lithium hydroxide cartridge and stow cartridge and bracket in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>&quot;
130:32:08|T|LMP|Okay, at 153:45, we change the LiOH, and we stow the cartridge and the bracket in the jett bag.
130:32:15|T|Slayton|That's affirmative. And then same page, top of the right-hand, eliminate &quot;Pro, 30 - Verb 37 Enter&quot;.  that line and also &quot;Standby Light, On&quot;. And that's all the changes we have here.
130:32:33|T|LMP|Okay, fine. Next line down, that &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="alsj">ECS</a> for sleep&quot;, we'll go &quot;Cabin Gas Return to Open&quot; again, Deke.
130:32:43|T|Slayton|Okay; and stand by 1, here. I believe we've got a comm configuration they wanted to change on you. Just a second.
130:33:52|T|Slayton|Okay. Orion, Houston.
130:34:00|T|LMP|Go ahead.
130:34:02|T|Slayton|Okay, we want to try a configuration change here on your comm to save a little power trying to hold Low Bit Rate with an 85-foot dish.
130:34:12|T|Slayton|Which means select Low Bit Rate; Voice, Off; open the Power Amp circuit breaker; and wait about 4 minutes. And then return to the opposite configuration. Do not touch the Power Amp switch, and you'll have no comm during this period of 4 minutes. Want me to go back through that slow?
130:34:39|T|CDR|Yeah, could you run through it again slow?
130:34:43|T|Slayton|Okay, you can go Low Bit Rate. And you can do that right now.
130:34:50|T|CDR|That's done.
130:34:52|T|Slayton|Okay, stand by 1.  Okay, now you can go Voice, Off. At the conclusion of that, of course, we'll be out of contact with you. Open the Power Amp circuit breaker and then stand by for 4 minutes. Then return to the original configuration.
130:35:27|T|CDR|Okay, we got it.
130:35:28|T|Slayton|Okay.
130:38:57|T|Slayton|Orion, Houston. You can now turn Voice on again close the Power Amp . Apparently their little test didn't work.
130:40:46|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Orion. We're back up in comm configuration. How do you read? Over.
130:40:53|T|Slayton|Rog. Read you 5 by 5; and we've just got one final thing to do and that should salt it down for the evening. Just wanted to double check that you've got your suit hose connectors red-to-red, blue-to-blue.
130:41:20|T|Slayton|Okay. As soon as you're through with that, give us a call and turn your Voice off and go to sleep. Sleep tight.
130:41:31|T|CDR|Roger.
130:41:35|T|Slayton|And we've got a full 8 hours programmed for whenever you power down and it gives you plenty of time tomorrow to do everything you've got to do, so don't sweat it.
130:41:45|T|CDR|Okay. I was right pleased that we could get through that today. I thought it was going to be kind of tight. And I was pleased that we got as much done as we did.
130:42:00|T|Slayton|So was everybody else. I was
130:42:02|T|CDR|I'm sorry that we had that accident with that cable. We probably should improve our training along those lines, but I don't know what else to do.
130:42:17|T|Slayton|Rog. Can't win them all, John. That was a beautiful job; you guys were right on the line all the way. For your information, we do have some people playing around with a potential fix to that heat flow thing; but my personal opinion is that it ain't going to work. I don't think it's worth the bother, but we'll talk to you about that later, if it looks like it's at all possible.
130:42:51|T|CDR|Roger.
131:10:39|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We are all rigged up for sleep, and we'll be seeing you in the morning.
131:10:57|C|Roo|Okay, John. I guess we're all ready for you to go to sleep. One thing we want to - Stand by. We want your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_isolation_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Isol Valves</a> to Connect. I hope that's the right terminology for you LM-ies.
131:11:31|T|CDR|We got Suit Flow and Suit Disconnect. What do you want?
131:11:42|C|Roo|Okay. We want the CDR's hose to Connect and Suit to Flow.
131:12:24|T|CDR|You're snowing me there. What do you want? You want flow through the hose or not?
131:12:35|C|Roo|Okay. We want the CDR's Suit Isol to Flow. We want it the same configuration as old Percy over there.
131:12:54|T|CDR|The CDR's Suit Isol valve to Flow.
131:13:01|C|Roo|That's affirmative.
131:13:07|T|CDR|Okay, you want it to Flow.
131:13:10|C|Roo|Okay, it looks good.
131:13:15|T|CDR|Okay.
131:13:19|C|Roo|And, good night.
131:13:27|T|CDR|Good night to you guys. Thank you much for a good day. We enjoyed it.
131:13:31|C|Roo|Okay. We'll look forward to a bigger and better one tomorrow.
131:22:00|C|Roo|Go ahead, Orion.
131:22:04|T|CDR|Okay, this is Orion. Could we put our <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/a12StarList.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">AOT detent</a> to either 4 or 6, because the Sun is shining right in it right now, and it's lighting up the whole cockpit even though we've got the lights turned down. It's just like we got a big spot in here. Or is that not possible?
131:22:24|C|Roo|Okay. Stand by.
131:23:06|C|Roo|Okay. John. The word is, you can put it in any position you want, if that'll solve your problem. We don't care.
131:23:19|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.  That solved our problem, in detent 6. Thank you much, Houston.
131:23:57|C|Roo|Roger, Orion. And, good night, again.
131:45:33|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, if you'll give us Low Altitude on the V-over-H Override.
131:45:38|T|CMP|Okay, going Low Altitude.
131:45:40|T|CMP|Mark.
131:45:41|C|Roo|Okay.
131:47:56|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. You can go to Center/Off position on the V-over-H Override, and you can go Auto on the High Gain.
131:48:10|T|CMP|Okay, V-over-H Override is Center/Off and the High Gain is in Auto.
131:48:16|C|Roo|Okay.  And, Ken. Just for your info, the field geology team are in the final phase of making their plans for EVA-2 tomorrow. So, if you've got any additional comments, why, better make them this pass because they'll have it all firmed up.
131:48:52|T|CMP|Oh, I think they're smarter than I am.
131:48:59|C|Roo|Well, now. Don't get too carried away  up there.
131:49:04|T|CMP|No, I would really - I'd really hope they make it to North Ray, though. I think that's going to be different than we expected it to be.
131:49:17|C|Roo|Rog.  Okay, Ken, we are ready for Pan Camera Power to Off at this time.
131:50:16|T|CMP|Okay, Pan Camera Power is coming Off.
131:50:19|T|CMP|Mark.
131:50:20|C|Roo|Okay, we got it.
131:51:56|C|Roo|Hey, Ken. How did we make out in our discussion on North Ray low altitude there as far as being able to see the white albedo or not? Or, were you too far to the south?
131:52:10|T|CMP|Oh, I got ahead. It depends which rev you want to talk about. On - When I looked at her on the first day, right after DOI, there wasn't any - There was two craters, but no rays. When I went back and looked at him on landing morning, there's a slight ray. But North Ray still doesn't stand out as being the bright guy that South Ray does.
131:52:35|C|Roo|Well, it's obvious I was talking about the landing day.
131:52:43|T|CMP|I gathered that it would be the case.
131:52:47|C|Roo|Yeah, by all means.
131:52:58|T|CMP|Right now I would agree with you on anything, Stu.
131:53:01|C|Roo|Yeah, I'll be quiet -
131:53:02|T|CMP|I'm here with my -
131:53:04|C|Roo|I'll be quiet -
131:53:05|T|CMP|- potato soup and my - Ah! Ah!
131:53:12|C|Roo|Yeah, I ought to - I'll be quiet here and let you concentrate on your eating.
131:53:20|T|CMP|Oh, man. This is gourmet style. I got - I got the Modern Jazz Quartet playing &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; and I got orange/grapefruit - some of it in the bag, some of it on the bulkheads - potato soup. Man, it's real gourmet style. Even got a Beta candle.
131:53:51|C|Roo|Hey, Ken. With all of that, now while ago you talked about some Casperellos - with all that Beta Candle and all that food, you don't have any such thing as a Casperette, do you?
131:54:08|T|CMP|No, I'm afraid I left that at home.
131:54:10|C|Roo|All right.
131:54:14|T|CMP|That's about all this place is lacking, though.
132:07:14|C|Roo|And, Ken, just another comment to close the loop on you on that P23s, the - Like I said before, the marking data was very good, and it came up with an horizon of 33 and loaded is a value of 28. And, after massaging all the data, decided to not change it since we've shown on the other missions that coming back - have a tendency to have a lower horizon. So, looks like we're just swinging with what we got there.
132:07:58|T|CMP|Okay, that's just fine.
132:11:01|T|CMP|Hey, Stu.
132:11:04|C|Roo|Yeah, go ahead.
132:11:06|T|CMP|Couldn't pass up a chance to watch the landing site one more time, and so I took a quick break from chow and went and watched it. And had a couple of questions in mind and only got two of them answered. One of them is that - Counting the layers in North and South Ray, and South Ray looks different than North in that South Ray shows three distinct light and dark sequences. I suspect they're slumps, but there's at least three bands. North Ray doesn't have any of that sort of thing. It's obvious from this altitude. I took another look for the terraces and the whole area - The thing that we thought looked so distinctly different in the photographs, looked like Stone Mountain and Smoky Mountain were two different things and something came in the middle of it; and it doesn't look that way to me at all today. It looks to me like it's really all - Almost all part of the same material. And I've drawn another little mark on my map. It's just about where you folks said you thought the LM was, except a little farther over to the north. It turns out that there's one little bright speckle there that doesn't look like craters. I don't see anything except the speckle.
132:12:41|C|Roo|Okay, I'm looking there. Now, go straight north of the - of the LM and a little to the west, there's three small craters there that are covered with what looks like - by a ray, now. Where are you talking from that?  Okay, Ken. Did you fade out, or did you stop talking? How do you read?
132:13:48|T|CMP|Oh, hey. I had you off of Vox and I forgot to push the key down, I had gotten so use to it. No, I gave you an 80 and about - oh, you were lookin in the right area. And, let me see what I can give you for coordinates on that.
132:14:21|T|CMP|How about CB 5 and 80?
132:14:28|C|Roo|Okay. We've got CB 5 and 80.
132:14:34|T|CMP|Okay, and you know I'm not overhead long enough to be sure that that's what I'm looking at, but it looked to me like it had a different kind of glint to it.
132:14:38|C|Roo|Okay. I'm sure they've got that.
132:14:52|T|CMP|Oh, hey, I've got one.  Well, I missed it. By the time I got the camera, it was gone. But that little buildup that we talked that was just to the west of Lassell, I had it spotted, and I was grabbing for the camera, and I couldn't find it again after I got back.
132:16:27|C|Roo|Okay. And, Ken, if you want to go Accept, we'll uplink the jet monitor load; and, it's your choice whether you want us to initiate it or you want to initiate it.
132:16:46|T|CMP|All right, you guys can do that.
132:16:49|C|Roo|Okay, we've got - Copy that.
132:22:19|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. The computer is yours. Go to Block, and the EMP is running.
132:22:32|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much. You guys are really helpful.
132:28:41|C|Roo|And, Casper; Houston.
132:28:49|T|CMP|Be with you in a second.  Okay, go ahead, Stu.
132:29:09|C|Roo|Okay. We're showing a little over 14 minutes to LOS; but, we're going to lose data before that. And, we'd like to get that E-memory dump just any time you're ready. We're all configured.
132:29:31|T|CMP|You got it.
132:29:34|C|Roo|Okay.
132:31:51|C|Roo|And, Ken, on the High Gain, we'd like Reacq. We'd like Pitch, zero; Yaw, 170.
132:32:05|T|CMP|Okay, you have Reacq; Pitch, zero; Yaw, 170.
132:32:10|C|Roo|Okay.
132:35:01|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, we're going to lose comm with you here shortly. And, we'd like to get your onboard readouts and if you would get your book to copy, we've got a TEI-41 pad.
132:35:35|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see. Okay, I'll give you some readouts first. Battery C is 36.7; battery B, 36.3; battery A, 36.8. I guess all you really needed out of that was battery C though. Now, you'd like the pyro's. Okay. They're - A is 36.7 and B is 36.7.
132:36:24|C|Roo|Okay. We've got all of those. Give us your RCS.
132:36:26|T|CMP|And, you'd like to have -  You want the quantities?
132:36:34|C|Roo|That's affirmative.
132:36:40|T|CMP|Okay. On A 63 percent. Bravo shows 62 percent.
132:37:08|C|Roo|And, Ken; let's go Auto now with the High Gain. We're going to lose you in Reacq.
132:37:16|T|CMP|Okay. You've got Auto. Charlie is 66 and Delta is 67.
132:37:24|C|Roo|Okay. We've got all of those and I'd like to give you a TEI-41 pad.
132:37:33|T|CMP|Standing by to copy.
132:37:35|C|Roo|plus 173.29, assumes no LOPC-1.

132:39:17|C|Roo|Okay. That's a good readhack and we'd like to bid you good night and remind you that your Logic Power for the SIM bay is still on.
132:39:32|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much. I'll see you at the mare.
132:39:35|C|Roo|Okay. And we'd like to have Reacq at LOS. And that will be Pitch, zero; Yaw, 170 -
132:39:45|T|CMP|Okay, I'll get it.
132:39:48|C|Roo|Okay.
132:39:49|T|CMP|I have Pitch, zero; and 170 set in.
132:39:51|C|Roo|Okay. Get a good night's sleep.
132:39:56|T|CMP|Okay. Good night, Stu. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. You've been a big help.
132:40:03|C|Roo|We'll see you tomorrow.
132:40:08|T|CMP|Okay.
139:09:03|C|Pet|Orion, Houston. How do you read?
139:09:09|T|CDR|Rog. What time are we supposed to get up? Over.
139:09:13|C|Pet|John, I can't understand you. We'd like, if you're reading, to go Down Voice Backup.
139:09:23|T|CDR|Okay. What time is wake-up time?
139:09:33|C|Pet|You're about 3-1/2 minutes from nominal wake-up now.
139:09:39|T|CDR|Okay, we timed it pretty good.
139:09:42|C|Pet|Looks like you timed it just about right on your own.  Orion, Houston. Voice check.
139:10:36|T|CDR|We're reading you loud and clear on Down Voice Backup. Over.
139:10:40|C|Pet|Okay. We're reading you a little better, too.
139:10:59|T|CDR|How did the systems look last night?
139:11:03|C|Pet|Everything looked real good, John.
139:22:20|T|LMP|Hello, Houston; 15 .  Hello, Houston; 15. Over.
139:22:59|T|LMP|I guess it's 16; excuse me.  Fine. I guess we're 16. How did the biomed look on me all night long, Tony?
139:23:07|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. I guess the biomed looked good. How do you feel this morning?
139:23:15|T|LMP|I feel great. Why don't you have the docs tell me how much they think I slept?
139:23:27|C|Eng|Charlie, they say they think you've slept 6 hours.
139:23:36|T|LMP|Okay, fine. I was going to say 7. Of course, I don't know exactly when we got started, but once we got started, it was just like a baby, except for - One time, I woke when I got cold, and had to put on my sleeping bag.
139:23:53|C|Eng|Outstanding.
139:23:59|T|LMP|Day 5 Meal C, and Day 6 Meal A. And on Day 5 Meal C, John ate everything, plus an EVA beverage. And the Day 6 meal A, which was breakfast yesterday, John ate everything except the ham steak. You can scratch the ham steak. He got 7 hours and 15 minutes sleep last night, and he took no medication. Over.
139:25:12|C|Eng|Okay; we got that, Charlie.
139:25:33|T|LMP|Okay; turning to my page. On Day 5 Meal C, you can scratch the chocolate pudding, and I ate everything else plus the EVA beverage. And John, also, had an EVA beverage. On Day 6 Meal A, I ate everything but the ham steak. Over.
139:26:10|T|LMP|And I said I got 7 hours, but whatever you all say. I slept real good; feel great.
139:26:28|C|Eng|Okay; before you all get too covered up , we'd like you to check your biomed sensors.  And did you take any medication?
139:26:37|T|LMP|Yeah, I took another Seconal again, to start off. And I guess my biomed is good; John's look firm as they can be.
139:26:57|C|Eng|Okay.
139:27:05|T|LMP|Now we're going to start the chow. And, well, I guess I'll copy the lift-off times first, if you have them.
139:27:13|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
139:27:19|T|LMP|Do you have those lift-off times for us?
139:27:24|C|Eng|Okay; stand by one.  Okay, Apollo 16. We don't have that block time yet. We'll get it to you in a minute. We have a couple of questions about the heat flow again, if you want to think about those.
139:28:16|T|LMP|Go ahead.
139:28:17|C|Eng|Okay. That heat flow cable that fits into the Central Station is connected to a printed circuit board inside the connector there. And we're curious about the end of the cable. Does it have any of that printed circuit board on it or is it just a free end of the ribbon cable?
139:28:41|T|LMP|Tony, I was thinking about that last night, and it looked like to me that it might have some of that printed circuit. All I can see is that the end of the cable is very smooth and it's silver and I think the printed circuit is partly silver, but I'm not really positive; that's something you can think about. And it is very smooth; and around the connector it is very smooth there, also. And as John kicked that thing out of there, it came right out of there without moving the Central Station at all! Over.
139:29:26|C|Eng|Okay. How about the PSE - the passive seismic cable? Is it tight? What we have to decide here is, if you move the Central Station, will it disturb the PSE? That thing is uncaged now and you can't re-cage it. So we can't afford to move it.
139:29:58|T|LMP|Well, he said he thinks it's pretty tight, John does; but I can't remember. How far do you want to move it?
139:30:10|C|Eng|Well, what we're thinking about is if we did ask you to take off that astroconnector on the heat flow experiment, you may have to lift the station up to get underneath to the little lever.
139:30:24|T|LMP|Yeah. But, Tony, everybody's told me it's serrated and once you got that little beauty on there, you can't get it off!
139:30:34|C|Eng|We're working on that now.
139:30:40|T|LMP|Yeah, I think there's a little pin or something in there you have to push in. And I don't know whether we got the tools for that.  Well, I think we could do that. It's not that tight. I think we could do that; pick it up.
139:30:59|C|Eng|Okay; understand. Fredo's been over running, suited, this heat flow experiment, to see if the procedure is effective. We don't have a decision yet. We don't want to get you all excited about it, but we'll have something - a yes or no - in about 45 minutes.
139:31:19|T|LMP|Well, I guess we'll still be here.
139:31:25|C|Eng|Okay.
139:32:12|T|LMP|Tony, if I thought yesterday's meal was big, you ought to see this one. Man, there's a lot of chow here.
139:32:38|C|Eng|Charlie, which meal did you say you're eating?
139:32:52|T|LMP|It's breakfast. Day 7 meal A -
139:32:55|C|Eng|Okay.  We're just trying to put a little weight on you.
139:32:56|T|LMP|Day 6, Meal B tonight. Man, I tell you, I feel &quot;oink&quot; right now.
139:33:25|C|Eng|I can just sit here and talk a few words about the traverse today, if you like. I haven't really organized my notes on it, so it may ramble a little bit, but I've gotten a briefing by the planning team. It looks like an interesting plan here. The traverse is almost - Well, it's exactly like normal EVA-2.
139:33:50|T|CDR|There you go.
139:33:52|C|Eng|From Ken 's words, he can see definite benches in Stone Mountain and thinks that you'll have a pretty good chance of identifying them. He can see layers in South Ray, which makes the rays at Station 8 a whole lot more interesting than we had even anticipated. So right now, we'd like you to do a normal 4, 5, and 6. The main thing identifying 6 is being on the bottom of the slope of the lowest bench, Station 5 being on top of the first bench, and Station 4 being on top of the second bench. In fact, it may be even a little above. Right now, we're thinking that we won't have you aim for Crown, because Crown is probably a little bit more subdued than we'd like, and probably not worth the effort to get to. Cinco D and E is, as we talked about before - probably be Station 4 . It'll probably be a good place. At the end of Station 5, we may have you do an LPM . I'll update this all in real time for you, I'm just talking about what we'll probably do here. And Station 7 we're going to eliminate and take the whole time and put it at Station 10 so you'll be able to do that LM-area sampling you asked for; we think that sounds great. As you drive from 6 to 8, we're more interested now that you do get some pictures of Stubby as you go along - of that area - because we don't have Station 7; so we'll ask you to turn your DAC over that way as you're driving. A DAC pointed down-Sun probably wouldn't see much, anyway, in that zero phase.
139:35:32|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I think you'll be able to - From up on Stone there, it looks like to me you're gonna be able to see right into South Ray and right into Stubby and all those craters. The general topography here is a downslope. From North Ray, it leads from the ridge to our immediate right all the way down to South Ray, with the lowest point really being maybe south of Survey Ridge. Over.
139:36:06|C|Eng|Okay, right. And we could see, or I think I could see, the bright area of South Ray on the TV pan. It really stands out down there. But our really exciting station looks like it may be Station 8, and we're really going to encourage you to scout around and see if you can get the samples of the different layers that we see in South Ray.
139:36:31|T|LMP|It looks to us like the base of Stone Mountain is really topographically lower than we are right now.
139:36:42|C|Eng|Okay.  And, also, on Station 9, it may turn out to be difficult to find a pristine area. We'll let you scout around a little bit, and pick your own Station 9 on whatever looks like isn't ray material. And on the location of Station 10, we'd like you to put it just about where you said it might go as you were driving back yesterday. It sounds like the contact between the ray and the non-ray material is just west of you there, and we'd like to run the penetrometer array along the contact but in the ray material; that is, the penetrometer array would now go in a northeast/southwest direction. And a double core would be something like 50 meters to the southwest of the deep core.  I may correct that a second here. Hold on.  I'll correct that. The double core will be about 50 meters towards the LM but along the contact, so it'll be about 50 meters closer to the LM than the deep drill.  And at Station 10, since you'll have a longer sampling time, we'd like you to sample on both sides of the ray; in other words, in the ray, along the line between the deep drill core and the LM, and off the ray to the west.
139:38:41|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're going to have to move the UV camera back. I think the front lens is starting to get into the Sun.
139:38:52|C|Eng|Say again, John.
139:38:58|C|Eng|Okay, we've got a plan here at the end of the EVA to move it back. Do you think it will stay out of the Sun until then?
139:39:05|T|CDR|Did you get that, Houston?  Houston, 16. Over.
139:39:17|C|Eng|Go ahead.
139:39:38|T|LMP|Houston, did you copy John? Over.
139:39:41|C|Eng|We sure did there, Charlie. You copy us?
139:40:13|T|CDR|Okay, Honeysuckle. Nice to talk to you. How are y'all doing down there?
139:40:17|T|Saxon|We're doing great; nice to talk to you.
139:40:26|T|CDR|Right; you sound good.
139:40:28|T|Saxon|Roger that; we'll be with you shortly. We're just getting some line - .
139:40:33|T|CDR|Have a Swan for us.
139:40:46|T|Saxon|Say again, Orion. You're pretty poor quality on this backup.
139:40:54|T|CDR|I said 'quaff a Swan for us'.
139:41:00|T|Saxon|I still can't copy you, Orion. I'm sorry about this. The quality is very poor at the moment.
139:41:10|T|CDR|Okay, you're loud and clear.
139:41:12|T|Saxon|Roger that. I read you a bit better now.
139:41:30|T|LMP|John was saying, 'Have a Swan for us'.
139:41:32|T|Saxon|Roger.
139:41:51|C|Eng|Apollo 16, Houston.  Apollo 16, Houston.
139:42:40|T|Saxon|Houston, Comm Tech Honeysuckle Net 1. And how do you read?
139:42:42|T|Houston|Honeysuckle, Houston. Comm test. Loud and clear. How do you read?
139:42:46|T|Saxon|Houston, Comm Tech Honeysuckle net 1. How do you read?  Orion, this is Honeysuckle. We're still having a little trouble with the incoming from Houston. We should get it restored very shortly for you. Sorry about the delay.
139:43:20|T|CDR|Roger. Thank you.
139:43:22|T|Saxon|Okay, we're reading you this time for a change.
139:43:31|T|LMP|Okay. You guys are nice to talk to; we don't care about Houston.
139:43:35|T|Saxon|Well, thanks very much. Certainly appreciate it. It has been a pleasure working on this mission.
139:43:46|T|CDR|Roger. We'd sure like to come down there and see you folks after it's over, too.
139:43:51|T|Saxon|Well, you've got a permanent invite, any time you like.
139:44:00|T|CDR|That's very kind.
139:44:03|T|Saxon|We'll keep the beer cool for you.
139:44:06|T|Houston|Honeysuckle Comm Tech, Houston Comm Tech, Net 1.
139:44:11|T|CDR|You just got a couple of fellows going to show up on your lawn here - .
139:44:15|T|LMP|That 's the best idea I've heard all day.
139:44:20|T|Saxon|Thanks. It's a pretty good one down here, too.
139:44:30|T|LMP|You see, in my terminology, friendly 48-packs, right now, the way I feel. I'd really love one.
139:44:40|T|Saxon|Roger that. We're still having difficulty with the comm, Orion. Hopefully, very shortly, we'll get the net up for you.
139:44:57|T|LMP|Okay. Take your time. Don't worry about it; we're eating.
139:45:05|T|Saxon|Oh, don't worry, Orion; we're worrying.
139:45:19|T|Houston|Goddard Voice, Houston Comm Tech on -
139:45:22|T|Saxon|Roger. Goddard Voice.
139:45:25|T|Houston|Roger. How do you read?
139:45:26|T|Saxon|Read you loud and clear. How me?
139:45:27|T|Houston|I read you same.
139:45:28|T|Saxon|Roger. We'll check on the circuit.
139:45:29|T|Houston|Roger.
139:46:29|T|Houston|Honeysuckle Comm Tech, Houston Comm Tech. Contact Net 1 for a comm check.
139:46:31|T|Saxon|Loud and clear. Comm check on me.
139:46:33|T|Houston|You're loud and clear, also.
139:46:52|C|Eng|Orion, Houston.
139:46:59|T|LMP|Go ahead.
139:47:02|C|Eng|Hey, outstanding! You're back.
139:47:05|T|LMP|Yeah, you were gone for a little while, and we had a nice chat with Honeysuckle. They're mighty friendly folks down there.
139:47:17|C|Eng|Very good. Hey, during some of that, I was chatting away about EVA-2. I wonder how much of it you got? Did you get on through to Station 10?
139:47:30|T|LMP|No, we stopped at about Station 8, Tony. Well, actually, you were talking about taking pictures of Stubby as we go by Station 7; and that was all.
139:47:42|C|Eng|Okay, fine. If you'd like, I'll continue on with that.
139:47:49|T|CDR|you guys are going to have to tell us, when we get to a place, what you want done when we get there. There's no way we can remember it or write it down.
139:48:02|C|Eng|Oh, I understand that. And we'll do all of it real time, but I just thought that you might like an overall plan before you get out.
139:48:14|T|CDR|Okay; that's a good idea.
139:48:15|C|Eng|Okay. As you drive from Station 6 to 8, we'd like for you to swing that DAC over and take pictures into Stubby, and all points to the south. And then we're going to really stress Station 8, because it may be a chance to sample many of those materials that Ken was able to see in South Ray, so Station 8 is a key station. Station 9, we're not at all sure that you'll be able to rec - The nominal Station 9 is a pristine area, so we'll just let you scout around and see if you can find the best you can. And Station 10 will be longer.
139:49:03|T|LMP|I was going to say, Tony. I guarantee you we'll find a place that's out of sight of the LM that's 3 or 4 kilometers away.
139:49:11|C|Eng|Okay, good show. And Station 10 will be 12 to 15 minutes longer now, and we'd still like it on a line between the deep core and the LM, so it will be on a northeast line. And we'd like it in the ray that you described, but near enough to the edge so that you can sample off the west edge of the ray. Also, we'd like you to pick up that vesicular basalt that you described underneath the engine bell.
139:49:48|T|CDR|Okay. Hey, listen. This is a pretty good size - I don't know how big this ray is, but for us to sample on the west edge of it , I don't understand how we're going to do that.
139:50:04|C|Eng|Where do you think that west edge was? Was it all the way back towards Spook?
139:50:15|T|CDR|It's not that far; but I think, like, if we go due west of the LM, we can go 300 meters and start running into some really big boulders, which are probably in the center of the ray, and then they thin out a little off to the other side - So, the ray - I think we're in about the three quarters of it, and it probably runs over that way for a good long ways.
139:50:53|C|Eng|John, the comm was bad enough, I didn't get all that. Maybe they got it in the Backroom back there, and we'll act on it real time.
139:51:03|T|CDR|Okay. All I'm saying is the ray must be 350 meters wide, and we're on probably the east half of it.
139:51:40|C|Eng|When you get a chance up there, could you look out the window and see if the LRV battery covers are still open?
139:52:02|T|LMP|Yeah, they're both still open, Tony.
139:52:04|C|Eng|Okay, they're both still open.
139:52:09|T|LMP|Yeah; in fact, all three of them are open.  Oh, that's right. John just reminded me two of them are hooked together, but they're all open anyway.
139:52:26|C|Eng|Okay.
139:52:29|T|CDR|I think one problem, - analysis may not have figured, is that we probably are parked at about a four or five degree right roll. So it put it more into the Sun than it would have been otherwise.
139:52:47|C|Eng|Right.
139:54:30|C|Eng|I have this block data here, if you want to take it sometime.
139:54:41|T|CDR|Okay.  - my opinion, would probably be to sample the edge of ray, we gotta go east maybe about 100 meters.
139:54:52|C|Eng|I'm sorry, John. The comm is real bad. Say it again, please.
139:54:59|T|CDR|I said, it would probably be best to go east a hundred meters to sample the edge of the ray. We'd be closer to the edge.
139:55:22|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Give me 2 seconds, and you start going with the update.
139:55:39|C|Eng|Okay, the block data update.  T-35, 142 plus 10 plus 51; T-36, 144 plus 09 plus 22; T-37, 146 plus 07 plus 53; T-38, 148 plus 06 plus 25; T-39, 150 plus 04 plus 57. And that's it.
139:56:56|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. For some reason Rev 34 is blank. We missed that last night, and we didn't get it this morning. But starting with 35: 142 plus 10 plus 51; 144 plus 09 plus 22; 146 plus 07 plus 53; 1 plus 48 plus 06 plus 25; 150 plus 04 plus 57. Over.
139:57:28|C|Eng|Okay; the only one I have question on was T-38:148 plus 06 plus 25.
139:57:37|T|LMP|That's a Charlie; that's what I got.
139:57:40|C|Eng|Okay; good show.
139:57:46|T|LMP|Hey, is it Friday or Saturday down there?
139:57:51|C|Eng|You know, I had to think about that last night. In fact, I had to ask Kathy. It's Saturday.
139:57:56|T|LMP|Okay; thank you. Saturday morning?
139:58:01|C|Eng|Rog. It was a nice, humid, but sunny morning when I came in.
139:58:09|T|LMP|Good show. What is your GET now?
139:58:13|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie?
139:58:19|T|LMP|What is the present GET? Over.
139:58:24|C|Eng|Okay, it's about 10 minutes 'til eight in the morning.
139:58:34|T|CDR|GET; Ground Elapsed Time.
139:58:36|C|Eng|Oh, EGT . GET is 140 plus 10.  You'll have to excuse me down here. I'm having to interpolate. The comm is really bad.
139:59:01|T|LMP|Well, Honeysuckle was reading us pretty good!
139:59:42|C|Eng|Orion, Houston. Are you going to carry your pliers out with you?
139:59:52|T|LMP|Yeah; John's got 'em in - had them in his pocket last time.
139:59:56|C|Eng|Okay, good show. We may need that to work on the cosmic ray.
140:00:28|T|CDR|Hey, Tony?
140:00:29|C|Eng|Go ahead, John.
140:00:34|T|CDR|Did you hear what we said about the UV camera? Over.
140:00:39|C|Eng|I got about the UV camera; and we got a procedure all ready that we'll probably ask you to move it back to the north at the end of EVA-2. You don't think it will be in the Sun before that, do you?
140:00:55|T|CDR|It's in the Sun right now. The lens is in the - The imagery is in the Sun.
140:01:01|C|Eng|Okay, we'll probably have you do it right away when you get out, then.
140:01:08|T|CDR|Are you sure this is going to be a normal EVA-2!?
140:01:11|C|Eng|Yes, it's a nominal EVA-2 with the exceptions I talked about.
140:01:31|T|CDR|Okay, we're just pulling your leg, Tony.  We'll just play it real time, Tony.
140:01:37|C|Eng|We're just going to have you rebuild ALSEP and the cosmic ray experiment; otherwise, it is a normal EVA.
140:01:46|T|CDR|That's what we're saying.
140:02:12|T|LMP|If we eat all this meal, Tony, we are not going to be able to get our suits on.
140:17:43|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
140:17:46|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
140:17:50|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we're going to pick up the ETB , and try to get a handle on going through this procedure. We're on 3-7 and the eat period. We're going to pick up on 3-7. Do you want us to top off the PLSS O2?
140:18:21|C|Eng|Stand by one.
140:18:30|T|LMP|And how do we look right now on your timeline - ?
140:18:42|C|Eng|Okay, go ahead on 3-7 there and top off the PLSS O2, and say that last comment again.
140:18:53|T|LMP|Okay, how are we on the timeline? We're just about through eating.
140:19:02|C|Eng|Okay, stand by one.
140:19:03|T|CDR|It's a one-minute top off, is it not?
140:19:30|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie, you're in good shape. You look like you're about on it.
140:21:06|T|CDR|Charlie will be off comm for a while.
140:21:09|C|Eng|Okay, fine. And, John, if you have a minute there, you might consider attaching a lanyard to your Apple on the purge key and attaching the lanyard to one of the fittings on the front of the suit so that if that key comes out, you won't have to go looking for it.  But that's a crew preference; whatever you think's necessary.
140:21:34|T|CDR|Okay.  Attach a lanyard so the purge key doesn't get away from us.
140:21:45|T|LMP|Huh?
140:21:46|T|CDR|Attach a lanyard so the purge key doesn't get away from us.  -
140:21:54|C|Eng|We just aim to please, John.
140:21:59|T|CDR|Say again.
140:22:01|C|Eng|We just aim to please, John.
140:23:23|T|CDR|No, we're not supposed to bring it back!  Huh?
140:26:22|T|CDR|I don't know, Charlie. I can't remember where it comes in the Flight Plan. I think it's right at 130 hours.   -  Yeah.  No, what?  - what?
140:27:16|T|CDR|Look at that! If anybody ever said, &quot;you'll be sitting in a spacecraft naked with a 134-pound backpack on your knees charging it&quot;, I'd have said &quot;Aw, get serious&quot;.
140:27:47|T|CDR|It all depends on if you have your mags changed right, Charlie. You've gotta sort of sit up above the ground.
140:29:33|T|CDR|Is that yours? Is this yours right here?   -   - one more time. Make sure.  Really need those things .
140:31:38|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie did you dump all your urine? No. Huh?
140:31:40|T|LMP|
140:31:43|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
140:31:50|T|CDR|Am I hot-miked to you? Over.
140:40:23|T|CDR|Okay there, Houston. I'm checking the LCG now.
140:40:30|C|Mit|Roger, Orion.
140:42:32|T|CDR|Houston, Orion.
140:42:34|C|Pet|Go ahead, Orion.
140:42:40|T|LMP|Right. Do we have any updates to the EVA-2 checklist?
140:42:49|C|Pet|Orion, you're very garbled there. We don't have the updates yet, I guess.
140:43:01|T|LMP|Okay; be advised that we're starting to put on our suits right now . Over.

142:37:14|C|Eng|We thought about that last night. And one minute's up.
142:37:22|T|LMP|John, let me get yours off. Wait, we can't do it both . At least, I can't reach yours if you're going to mine.
142:37:31|T|CDR|Okay, mine decayed about 0.2 . Actually, it was a little less than 0.2 because I ran it for about a minute twenty .
142:37:41|T|LMP|Okay, mine was less than 0.2; about one and a half . Okay, would you turn my oxygen On, please, John? Yours is On.
142:37:51|C|Eng|Okay, we copy.

142:40:41|T|CDR|Coming up on 0.3 .
142:40:51|T|CDR|Okay, coming up on 2 minutes. Supposed to be able to crack the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../forward_hatch.jpg" title="Frank O'Brien CAM photo" target="alsj">hatch</a> at 2 minutes.
142:40:55|T|LMP|Yeah, there's the water flag.
142:40:58|T|CDR|Okay. Must be getting up there somewheres.
142:41:03|T|LMP|Yeah.
142:41:07|T|CDR|- water flag A. Okay, see if you can torque the - Open forward hatch, I guess.
142:41:13|T|LMP|Okay.
142:41:15|T|CDR|It's down to -
142:41:16|T|LMP|That ought to work right.
142:41:18|T|CDR|It's coming up 2 minutes, right now.
142:41:24|T|LMP|Okay.
142:41:25|T|CDR|Mark.
142:41:40|T|CDR|There it is. Man!
142:41:42|T|LMP|Now, go out, dust and everything.
142:41:46|T|CDR|I'll tell you why you can't open it is on account of there's air behind it.
142:41:54|C|Eng|Maybe it'll clean some of that dirt out.
142:41:56|T|CDR|Okay.
142:41:56|T|LMP|You got it?  It does a pretty good job at that.  Hey, John, you're gonna have to turn around and get over next to your circuit breaker panel for me to get any water on or anything.
142:42:12|T|CDR|Okay. Which way?
142:42:16|T|LMP|Turn to your right.
142:42:25|T|CDR|Can you get it?
142:42:26|T|LMP|Well, I can; my darn -  Both hands are all -
142:42:34|T|CDR|Okay, let me get yours.
142:42:36|T|LMP|Can you reach it?
142:42:39|T|CDR|Watch it that that hatch don't fall shut. Can you turn around?
142:42:43|T|LMP|That's where I'm gonna head. Wait a minute. Okay, there we go.
142:42:55|T|CDR|Can you raise up?
142:42:56|T|LMP|Not much more; I'm hitting the ceiling.
142:43:18|T|CDR|There you are.
142:43:19|T|LMP|Okay. Water's On.
142:43:21|T|CDR|Water is On!
142:43:22|T|LMP|Okay. Turn back around, I think. I hope. Okay, let me have the hatch.
142:43:30|T|CDR|Okay. Going to hand me the jettison thing and -
142:43:34|T|LMP|Yeah, when you get out on the porch, I'll hand you everything. Okay?
142:43:37|T|CDR|All right.  Okay, - .
142:44:03|T|LMP|I've still got a water flag. I can see yours is sublimating. You can really see it. Or you can see some ice building up back there anyway.
142:44:27|T|LMP|I'm getting good cooling. I can feel it.
142:44:29|T|CDR|Yeah, so do I.
142:44:31|T|LMP|Okay, let's go.
142:44:32|T|CDR|Okay.
142:44:33|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're gonna get out.
142:44:35|C|Eng|Okay, we understand your water flags are cleared.
142:44:40|T|CDR|That's correct.
142:44:41|T|LMP|John's is; mine's not quite, but I feel good cooling.
142:44:48|T|CDR|back up a hair?
142:44:50|T|LMP|No.
142:44:54|C|Eng|Okay, John, you're Go for egress. Charlie, we'd like you to stay.
142:44:56|T|LMP|Okay, mine just flipped.
142:44:58|C|Eng|Okay, fine. You're both Go for egress.
142:45:05|T|CDR|God damn hose is got in my way.
142:45:14|T|LMP|Okay, John. You're doing great. You got to come towards me a little bit. There you go.  Okay, you've got to swing your rear end towards me. There you go. Now your PLSS is out the door. Bend over a little bit, so you don't catch your harness . There you go.  You're okay.
142:45:38|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay, Charlie. Hand me the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>.
142:45:55|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
142:46:15|T|CDR|Hit the strut with it.
142:46:17|T|LMP|Yeah.
142:46:18|T|CDR|Didn't hurt the strut.
142:46:19|T|LMP|No. Okay, here's the ETB.
142:46:22|T|CDR|Okay, give me -
142:46:24|T|LMP|I don't want to throw it too hard with the cameras in there.
142:46:27|T|CDR|Okay.
142:46:29|T|LMP|There we go.
142:46:30|T|CDR|-  Wrap it around this finger.
142:46:35|T|LMP|Okay.  Recorder's Off; Vox is in Max; utility and floods. Okay, get the floods off. Utility's off.  And these look okay.  Coming over to this side, I think. There we go.
142:47:06|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. What do you want to do with the camera?
142:47:09|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like you to go over and describe to us where the Sun is with respect to the UV.
142:47:18|T|CDR|I could have done that standing in the vehicle.
142:47:23|C|Eng|Well, we're going to have you move it back, but we just wanted the data before you move it.
142:47:35|T|CDR|Charlie, watch out for the big rock in the footpad.
142:47:38|T|LMP|Yeah, I know it. I put it there. That's Old Muley .
142:47:47|T|CDR|Charlie, is my visor down? I can't -
142:47:51|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
142:47:52|T|CDR|Never mind, never mind.
142:47:54|T|LMP|Your protective one; I don't know about your -
142:47:56|T|CDR|Okay, I got them both down. The other one.
142:48:00|T|LMP|Okay, mine are down. Okay, Houston; I'm out on the porch.
142:48:07|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie.
142:48:11|T|LMP|Okay, got to go back and close the hatch.
142:48:15|T|CDR|Okay, the Sun is just - At this setting, the Sun is slicing off about 2-1/2 to 3 inches of the - It's slicing off half of the spectroscope box. You know what I mean?
142:48:40|C|Eng|Okay.
142:48:41|T|CDR|It slices right across there.
142:48:43|C|Eng|Okay, the Sun is on the film cassette, is that right?
142:48:48|T|CDR|It is on the spectroscope. The spectroscope box that hooks out. It's the optical part.
142:49:01|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like you to move the UV camera in the east direction, directly east, so that it's 1 foot behind the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> pad. Reset before you move it.
142:49:20|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay.
142:49:29|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm on the old lunar terrain again.
142:49:33|C|Eng|Very good.
142:49:35|T|CDR|Do a reset?
142:49:36|C|Eng|Okay, you do a reset and move the camera in the east direction until it's 1 foot behind a line that goes north-south through the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> footpad.
142:50:06|T|LMP|Oh, quarter to 11.
142:50:26|T|LMP|Man, that thing really pops open.
142:50:30|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, she's moved.
142:50:32|C|Eng|Okay, re-level it there, and then we're going to give you a target to aim at the Earth. Settings for aiming at the Earth.
142:50:59|T|CDR|Houston, this really isn't too very good for me to do this because I can't get my backpack between it and the strut to operate it. Did anybody try this in the real world?
142:51:22|C|Eng|Negative, John. If you have to move it south a little bit, it's safe to move it to the edge of that shadow.
142:51:36|T|CDR|Okay, let me do that.  Okay, it's re-moding now. We're going to lose whatever we're doing here.
142:51:53|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine. We understand.
142:52:33|T|LMP|Hey, John, that's better. I moved the MESA back down and, man, it's super nicer. Don't have to fight the suits. The SRC-1 is open. Hey, what I'm going to do, Tony; I'm going to bring up the TV for you.
142:52:53|C|Eng|Okay, when you push in the circuit breakers, would you read us the battery temperatures?
142:53:01|T|LMP|Okay, all the breakers are going in. And the battery temps are, one, 65, and the other is 82. Correction - One, 70, and the other is 82.
142:53:22|C|Eng|Okay, 70 and 82.
142:53:27|T|LMP|Okay, what's next, for the TV?
142:53:32|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
142:53:36|T|LMP|What is the next switch setting for the TV? It's not on my checklist.
142:53:46|C|Eng|Okay, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="alsj">LCRU switch</a>, Mode 1 .
142:53:53|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
142:53:57|C|Eng|Okay, position TV horizontal and counter-clockwise to stop.
142:54:06|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
142:54:13|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, the camera is re-leveled. Camera is re-leveled, Houston.
142:54:21|C|Eng|Okay, John, we'd like you to -
142:54:22|T|CDR|Now, what else did he say about this?
142:54:23|C|Eng|John, we'd like you to aim it at the Earth. The azimuth is 058 , elevation is 75.
142:54:34|T|CDR|Roger.
142:54:42|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, what else on the TV, please?
142:54:44|C|Eng|Okay, just go to Mode 3 on that and we'll leave it there. And we'll control it from here.
142:54:50|T|LMP|Okay, will you have a picture?  Okay.
142:55:01|C|Eng|Okay, John, with that azimuth and elevation, look through the Earth sight and center it on the Earth, then give us the azimuth you are reading and from that we'll calculate a new target.
142:55:20|T|LMP|Okay, y'all are just about dead center, Tony, in the high gain .
142:55:26|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
142:55:32|T|LMP|You ought to be getting a picture.
142:55:34|C|Eng|Okay; and, Charlie, go <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LCRU.html" target="alsj">External on the LCRU switch</a>.
142:55:40|T|CDR|What was the elevation setting, Tony?
142:55:44|C|Eng|Okay, the elevation is 75.
142:55:55|T|LMP|Okay. I copy that External.
142:55:56|C|Eng|Okay.
142:55:57|T|LMP|It is External.
142:56:00|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; I'll tell you what -
142:56:09|T|LMP|There. Now it 's External. It was Off.  Okay, your power is up to 4, Tony; I mean your S-band AGC is to 4 and you're External. It was Off; I'm sorry.
142:56:23|C|Eng|Okay.  And we've got a picture.
142:56:45|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; the Earth is in the center and the camera's re-leveled.
142:56:56|C|Eng|Okay, would you read off the azimuth now?
142:57:08|T|CDR|Well, I left the azimuth on there and leveled the camera and put the Earth in the center. How's that? Is that -
142:57:15|C|Eng|Okay, that sounds fine and the azimuth is 058.
142:57:21|T|CDR|058 and 76.
142:57:25|C|Eng|Okay, then the first target will be 112 and 40.
142:57:33|T|CDR|112 and 40.  You want to do a reset after we get to that target, right?
142:57:43|C|Eng|That would be fine. And when you do a reset, verify the film advances and read the tempa-label for us.
142:57:54|T|CDR|Okay.
142:57:55|C|Eng|That's the tempa-label on the film cassette.
142:58:00|T|CDR|Roger.
142:58:30|T|CDR|That's going to be pointing right at the lunar module, Houston!
142:58:34|C|Eng|Okay, then move it to the left until it is clear of it.
142:58:37|T|CDR|-   Oh.
142:58:43|C|Eng|Move it in azimuth.
142:58:52|T|CDR|You want me to move it to the left until it's clear, but I've got to take it out the other side of the vehicle.
142:58:57|C|Eng|Move it in azimuth.
142:58:58|T|CDR|I got to take it to the north of the vehicle.
142:58:59|C|Eng|Not the camera.
142:59:04|T|CDR|Okay. Thank goodness, you said that. I was about to pick this thing up.
142:59:12|C|Eng|Sorry about that, John.
143:00:24|T|LMP|There's no way to get that out - .
143:01:03|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, I think we're clear now.
143:01:05|C|Eng|Okay, good show. Hit reset, watch the film.
143:01:10|T|CDR|But it's reading 080 , Houston.  Is that okay?
143:01:25|C|Eng|Stand by a second, John. Why don't you read that tempa-label to us ?
143:01:34|T|CDR|On the battery?
143:01:35|C|Eng|No; that's on the film cassette.
143:01:41|T|CDR|Okay. The tempa-label on the film cassette is black at a 100 degrees F.
143:01:48|C|Eng|Good show. That's good news. I hate to do this to you, John, but we're going to have to change targets. We'd like to go to azimuth 317.
143:01:59|T|CDR|Okay, 317.
143:02:15|C|Eng|And elevation, 51.
143:02:46|T|CDR|Okay, 317 at 51.
143:02:49|C|Eng|Okay, hit reset and watch the film; if it advances, we're through with it for now.
143:03:00|T|CDR|Oh, boy; it advanced! Over 120 - Almost 180.
143:03:06|C|Eng|Good show. That's the way it should go. Now we'd like you to turn around and look at the cosmic ray for a second.
143:03:10|T|CDR|Okay.  Get turned around and looked at the cosmic ray.
143:03:16|T|LMP|Turn around and lookit the cosmic ray.
143:03:19|T|CDR|That's a nice cosmic ray and -
143:03:21|C|Eng|Okay.  In the top panel -
143:03:24|T|CDR|Where's this -
143:03:25|C|Eng|- in the top panel when you pulled that -
143:03:27|T|CDR|Yes?
143:03:28|C|Eng|- ring, a piece of tinfoil should have slid up so there's only a 2-by-2 flap in the upper left-hand corner. Can you see that tinfoil?
143:03:45|T|CDR|There's only a 2 by 2 flap in the upper left-hand corner. Yeah, but it's more than 2 by 2; it's about - There's a hole that's covered up. There's a hole up there, and it's covered up in the upper left-hand corner, or almost covered up.
143:04:06|C|Eng|Okay. Understand that. That should be right.
143:04:11|T|CDR|It's almost covered up.
143:04:13|C|Eng|Could you describe how it's almost covered up? Which part isn't covered?
143:04:19|T|CDR|The bottom part of the hole is almost uncovered. I'd say the bottom one-fourth of the hole is not covered.
143:04:34|C|Eng|Okay. That's good news, John. That means you deployed -  It deployed fine. We'll get a picture of it later from Charlie, and if you could go about your nominal work now.
143:04:54|T|CDR|Ah, the old water bag is working super! This is going to be a good day, Charlie.
143:04:58|T|LMP|Good.   Ah, the old commander's camera. Right down in the old dust.  That's on the floorboard; that's not onto the ground.
143:05:15|T|CDR|Okay.  I wonder what my nominal workload is at this point.
143:05:22|T|LMP|I don't know.
143:05:24|T|CDR|We're supposed to be at Station 4, Charlie.
143:05:27|T|LMP|Just like in training, John -
143:05:29|T|CDR|Yeah.
143:05:31|T|LMP|- I'm licking the orange juice off my visor.
143:05:38|C|Eng|And, Charlie, when you're taking that pan, let me know. I have another picture for you.
143:05:45|T|LMP|All righty!
143:05:47|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, hold still a second and let me get your old PLSS strap tie-down on here a little bit.
143:05:53|T|LMP|Old PLSS strap tiedown.
143:05:59|T|CDR|Man, that's really bad there.   don't know how a growing boy could get his straps so messed up in one little EVA.
143:06:26|T|LMP|Oh, the old dark slide. Coming out! Expose one picture. Okay.
143:06:42|T|CDR|Okay.  You got the ETB . Right?
143:06:46|T|LMP|Yeah. Just about finished with it.
143:06:49|T|CDR|You got the LRV circuit breakers, Bus A, B, C, and D, and Nav closed?
143:06:53|T|LMP|Yup. No, I didn't close - Yeah, Nav Power's closed.
143:06:56|T|CDR|Okay. The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> is on the LCRU. It is.
143:06:59|T|LMP|Amazing.
143:07:01|T|CDR|&quot;Close LRV covers and press tight.&quot; Okay, Houston, the covers are still open, and they don't have any more dust on them than they did yesterday.
143:07:11|C|Eng|Outstanding.
143:07:13|T|LMP|Therefore, you have to dust.  What we need is a dustbrush for the dustbrush.
143:07:26|C|Eng|Don't say it, Charlie.
143:07:31|T|LMP|Say again?
143:07:33|C|Eng|I said, don't suggest it.
143:07:38|T|LMP|Yeah. Somebody will probably log that.
143:07:52|T|CDR|Hey! Can you guys see that dust on there, with the TV?
143:07:56|C|Eng|We're not looking down far enough right now.
143:07:59|T|CDR|Oh.
143:08:00|T|LMP|John, make sure that I did all the things on - The ETB is emptied, and magazine Lima is on the camera - 500 - and all the other film is stowed.
143:08:11|T|CDR|Whew. Okay. Down and pressed tight.
143:08:17|C|Eng|Okay.
143:08:19|T|LMP|Man, that LPM is a bucket of spaghetti!
143:08:28|T|CDR|You're not messing with it, are you?
143:08:30|T|LMP|No. I was just -
143:08:32|T|CDR|And as near as I can figure, Tony, what we've got to do now is load up the PLSSs and go get 'em .
143:08:42|T|CDR|Want me to reset the far UV again, or you just want to be happy with this? All we got to do now is a PLSS load-up.
143:08:49|C|Eng|Okay; yes. We have one more target on it. I'm not sure they have enough time, yet. Hold on.
143:08:56|T|LMP|Want a minute; I got to get a pan, John. So it'll be a few minutes. Why don't you run around and pick up a rock?
143:09:02|T|CDR|Hey! Outstanding suggestion. Give me a rock bag, Charlie.
143:09:08|T|LMP|The little ones or the big ones?
143:09:10|T|CDR|Huh?
143:09:11|T|LMP|Why don't you take your camera?
143:09:12|T|CDR|I will.
143:09:15|T|LMP|Okay. That -
143:09:16|T|CDR|That's yours, huh?
143:09:17|T|LMP|Yeah. Well, I got some right here. You use those, and I'll put the old maps - Which way are we going today? Hmmm.
143:09:28|C|Eng|How about south?
143:09:33|T|LMP|Let's see, &quot;Hadley Rille&quot;.
143:09:42|C|Eng|Okay -
143:09:43|T|LMP|Tony, this map says &quot;Start at training building.&quot;
143:09:48|C|Eng|Okay. Verify that your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj">PLSS antennas</a> are up, and could we have an EMU check first chance? And John, if you're out picking up a rock, you might -
143:09:58|T|LMP|Our antennas aren't up. How's the comm?
143:10:01|C|Eng|Comm sounds good.
143:10:05|T|LMP|Maybe we ought to leave them down. That way we won't break them off!
143:10:13|C|Eng|And John, if you're picking up a rock, could you get that -
143:10:15|T|LMP|Always thought it would work -
143:10:17|C|Eng|- the vesicular basalt underneath the engine bell?
143:10:24|T|CDR|Yep. Sure could do that.
143:10:27|T|LMP|Tony, that is a &quot;double&quot; Muley, that rock.
143:10:30|C|Eng|Uh-oh.
143:10:32|T|LMP|Come here, John. Let me get your antenna.  Well, I can't reach it. Why don't you get downslope and lean on the Rover.
143:10:43|T|LMP|There we go. Camera's on. This is a - Guess what. The antenna's up, and the comm is still the same. There we go.
143:10:59|C|Eng|And just forget that big rock for now. That's too big to handle.
143:11:07|T|CDR|Well, it's inaccessible; it's underneath the engine cover.
143:11:11|C|Eng|Okay; fine.
143:11:12|T|CDR|You want me to crawl under the LM?
143:11:13|C|Eng|No. That's all right.
143:11:15|T|CDR|Okay. But there's probably another nice rock. I'm sure there's another good rock around here that I've been eyeing out my window I wanted to get anyway.
143:11:25|T|LMP|Hey, John?
143:11:26|T|CDR|Yes, Charlie.
143:11:27|T|LMP|I hate to tell you, but I need your camera for the - Here, take mine with the black-and-white and let me have yours for the pan.
143:11:35|T|CDR|Charlie.
143:11:36|T|LMP|I'm sorry. Little out of sequence here.  -
143:11:50|T|LMP|like running together in the Sahara Desert.
143:11:58|T|LMP|Let me -  Okay; I got it. I got it.
143:12:04|T|CDR|Got it?
143:12:05|T|LMP|Yeah.
143:12:06|T|CDR|Okay.
143:12:21|T|LMP|EDC . Let's see; &quot;pan quad III&quot;. Well, guess what? I'm on the wrong side .
143:12:30|T|LMP|Ah, me.  Works better for me, Tony, if skip out here rather than -  If you want some of this blackish rock, John, a small one that's bag-able; there's a bunch right out here that look just like what I call that basalt. In fact, there's hundreds of them.
143:13:08|T|CDR|Yeah. They're out from that little impact crater we just landed beyond. And I want to get this nice white one right here.
143:13:21|C|Eng|And -
143:13:22|T|LMP|- starts at f/11 at 250. Okay. Exactly 60 feet to the left, Tony!
143:13:36|C|Eng|Okay.
143:13:46|T|LMP|The best pan.
143:13:53|T|LMP|Boy, it sure looks different looking up-Sun.  You can still see those lineations in Stone Mountain, Tony. In fact, they're maybe a little bit more pronounced .
143:14:41|C|Eng|Okay. Why don't we catch that as you drive out -
143:14:43|T|LMP|But, otherwise, there are , all over the mountain.  Okay. I don't think we're going that far east, but -
143:14:49|C|Eng|Okay. Those extra pictures -
143:14:51|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. What is the other pic -
143:14:53|C|Eng|Right, of the Cosmic Ray experiment. So if you'll go over to that side, we'd like a cross-Sun, at f/11, 250 at 15 feet .
143:15:38|C|Eng|Okay, John. Sounds good. And Charlie, we'd like an up-Sun of that cosmic ray, also. And the settings on that will be f/5.6.
143:15:46|T|LMP|Okay. Looking up-Sun -  Okay. Do you know that thing's not even looking at the Sun, is that right? Is that what you want it to do?
143:15:55|C|Eng|That's right. We want it to look away from the Sun.
143:15:59|T|LMP|Okay; that's what it is. I don't think you're going to see much in this picture, but I'll take it. I guess it's just really gonna show you how it's sitting. Okay, that's done.
143:16:16|C|Eng|Okay; good show. And we'll have the UV after the PLSS load-up.
143:16:21|T|LMP|What else?
143:16:22|C|Eng|That's it, John - Charlie.
143:16:27|T|LMP|Oh!  I'm tangled up in this spaghetti here.
143:16:30|T|CDR|Charlie, don't get too close to that ; watch out for the battery cable.
143:16:33|T|LMP|I see that; it's just this Rover deploy cable I was in. There. There, I'm okay. Okay, we're ready for the load-up, and I'll swap cameras with you.
143:16:53|T|LMP|Put yours on your seat, John. Where'd those bags go that you had? You got them?
143:17:00|T|CDR|I put them over here on my back -
143:17:02|T|CDR|There you go, Charlie.
143:17:04|T|LMP|Just leave it there.
143:17:05|T|CDR|Where?
143:17:06|T|LMP|There . Okay. Why don't you put those on my camera, and I'll put these on yours.
143:17:10|T|CDR|Okay.
143:17:15|T|LMP|I got two core tubes sitting up there, too. Don't let me forget those.
143:17:19|T|CDR|Where? Up on the thing?
143:17:20|T|LMP|Yeah. Up on the Hand Tool Carrier.
143:17:22|T|CDR|You want them in this SCB here -
143:17:24|T|LMP|No. They go back in here (on one of the bags on the gate.
143:17:27|T|CDR|What are we gonna do with this SCB right here?
143:17:33|T|CDR|Okay. Fine. I'll get that.
143:17:36|T|LMP|The other one - You're going to be chock full of core tubes today, babe. I'll tell you. This is core-tube-taking day. And a super SE - whatever.
143:17:49|T|LMP|Okay. I'm ready for load-up, I guess.
143:17:51|T|CDR|Okay. Hold still.
143:17:52|T|LMP|Excuse me.
143:17:53|T|CDR|I'm loading you.
143:17:54|T|LMP|Excuse me.
143:17:58|T|CDR|I think that's what I'm doing.
143:18:03|T|LMP|Ah, the old lunar surface. We've really kicked this stuff up, Tony, right around the lunar module where we walked. Where you don't have the footprints and the tracks, it's very smooth, very white albedo -
143:18:18|T|CDR|Charlie, could you bend over?
143:18:20|T|LMP|Yeah.
143:18:21|T|LMP|Very white albedo. Where we've kicked it up, it's about two shades grayer. It's a lot darker albedo.  And you know why I think that is, Tony? You look down-Sun, and it's not that way. You look up-Sun, and it is. I think it's the shadows that the Sun casts on the particles that have been disturbed that causes it to give a darker albedo.
143:18:55|C|Eng|Good observation.
143:19:01|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I got you.
143:19:12|T|CDR|Open it.
143:19:13|T|LMP|I couldn't - I did. I couldn't get it off a minute ago. I mean I couldn't get it on a minute ago.
143:19:18|T|LMP|There we go.
143:19:19|T|CDR|Why don't you just lay those things on the seat.  -
143:20:03|C|Eng|We copy that.
143:20:05|T|LMP|Hold still, John. This thing keeps coming off.
143:20:08|T|CDR|In fact, the azimuth setting seems to be getting tighter and tighter. I don't understand that but, you know, that's what it seems to be doing.
143:20:49|T|CDR|3.85 , Min cooling, no flags, and I'm reading 84 percent .
143:21:05|C|Eng|Okay, we copy.
143:21:06|T|CDR|that sound about right to you, Houston? Should I be that low this quick?
143:21:15|C|Eng|We're working that.
143:21:16|T|CDR|I mean, I'm reading about 80 percent.
143:21:26|T|LMP|So am I, John.
143:21:28|T|CDR|Oh, okay.
143:21:29|T|LMP|Okay. My flags are clear, Houston, and I've got 80 - Oh, let's see.  Seventy five; I've got about 83 percent. And I'm Min cooling; and pressure is at 3.85, and I'm very comfortable.
143:21:46|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
143:21:47|T|LMP|Happy day. Okay;  &quot;LRV prep. HEDC RCU; left seat to RCU&quot;. Pan, I got. &quot;HEDC RCU to left seat.&quot;
143:21:59|C|Eng|And Charlie, verify the Q mags on the DAC and that the DAC's running. Or it runs.
143:22:07|T|LMP|It's not running, but the Q mag is there. I -
143:22:11|C|Eng|Rog. We just wanted you to verify that the DAC was working.
143:22:16|T|LMP|Okay. Just a minute.
143:22:22|T|LMP|Yep!
143:22:23|C|Eng|Good -
143:22:24|T|LMP|Believe it or not!
143:22:25|C|Eng|Good show.
143:22:33|T|CDR|Okay. Going to reset the far UV again, one more time.
143:22:37|C|Eng|Okay. And your azimuth will be 276.
143:22:48|T|CDR|Okay; 276.
143:22:50|C|Eng|And the elevation, 14.
143:23:36|T|CDR|This must be the volcanic gases , because it's looking right at Stone Mountain. Is that what you want?
143:23:47|C|Eng|I'll find out, John; that 276 and 14, that is target.
143:24:04|T|CDR|Okay; fine.  That's set, and she's working.
143:24:14|T|LMP|There's the big eye looking right at me! Boy, you can't get away with a thing around here.
143:24:18|C|Eng|Yeah, you're darned right.
143:24:19|T|LMP|Can't even turn around .  Okay, John. Babe, I'm ready to go.
143:24:39|T|CDR|Okay. How do you want - I get it, now.
143:24:48|T|CDR|Okay, Reset - Okay, we're going to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="alsj">Mode switch</a> to 1 on the LCRU, Houston.
143:24:52|C|Eng|Okay.
143:25:29|T|LMP|Okay; vise 172, okay?
143:25:34|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to initialize the Nav right here by just going to Reset.
143:25:42|T|LMP|I'll get System Reset.  Okay, I'm gonna climb in this beauty, I hope.
143:25:53|T|CDR|That's how you want to do that, isn't it, Tony?
143:25:58|C|Eng|Say again, John?
143:26:03|T|CDR|Okay. You don't need a Sun alignment or any of that stuff, do you?
143:26:11|C|Eng|Yes, we do, John. We need the Sun alignment, and go to Reset.
143:26:18|T|CDR|Okay.
143:26:31|C|Eng|And John, do you remember what the exact heading was where you were parked?
143:26:32|T|LMP|Oh, I'm in the machine!
143:26:37|T|CDR|I'm parked there now. It was 358 or whatever it's reading on there.
143:26:43|C|Eng|Okay; fine.
143:26:44|T|CDR|Don't you guys remember? I read it out to you.
143:26:46|C|Eng|All right. You just read north.
143:26:48|T|CDR|You want to start from here, or do you want to turn -  Okay.
143:26:56|T|LMP|We've got to get headed west for a Nav update, John.
143:26:59|T|CDR|Okay; and that's what we're gonna do.  Still works!
143:27:10|C|Eng|Good show.
143:27:17|T|LMP|We're under way.
143:27:21|T|CDR|Okay, do you want a Nav update from here now, or don't you?
143:27:24|C|Eng|Yes, we do, sir.
143:27:26|T|LMP|We've got to get it.
143:27:28|T|CDR|Okay. Whoa, horse.
143:27:34|C|Eng|And while you're there, we'll need a complete LRV readout.
143:27:40|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. It 's reading 1 degree to the left, the Sun is. And we're heading of 268; bearing is 000; distance, 00; range 00, of course. And we are pitched 4 degrees down.  And we are rolled 1 degree right - because Charlie's heavy today.
143:28:10|T|LMP|You rat!  That's why I didn't see that secondary from out here on the ground. You can't see the - The rocks are buried from -
143:28:21|T|CDR|Look at the rocks around there, Charlie.
143:28:24|T|LMP|I know it.
143:28:26|T|CDR|There's your basalts and things. Those are black. They're probably glass covered, don't you think?
143:28:31|T|LMP|They are. I picked up one out there. See where my footprints go?
143:28:35|C|Eng|Okay. Torque to 264, and could we have the rest of the numbers on the LRV?
143:28:42|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
143:28:48|T|CDR|Okay. 264.
143:28:50|T|LMP|Okay, we got 114 and 114. Make that 108 and 108. Off-scale low, off-scale low on the Amps. Volts are 68, 68. Batteries are 82 and 100 and - Now they're up to 80 and 60 - Oh, wait a minute. 80 and 95. Motors are off-scale low all of them.
143:29:21|T|CDR|Hey, Hous - Houston. The LCRU covers are supposed to be 100 percent open at this point, ain't they?
143:29:28|C|Eng|That's correct.
143:29:29|T|CDR|I'd better get off and open that rascal.
143:29:32|T|LMP|Okay.  Want me to do it, John?
143:30:04|T|CDR|Yeah. I guess you'd better, Charlie. I can't seem to unfasten this rascal again.  I got it. I got it.
143:30:12|T|LMP|I got it already. I'm gonna - I'm gonna do it.  Aow!
143:30:35|T|CDR|Watch it, Charlie.
143:30:37|T|LMP|Am I hitting the antenna?
143:30:38|T|CDR|Yep.
143:30:39|T|LMP|I was afraid of that.
143:30:40|T|CDR|Sticking your PLSS thing through it.
143:30:51|T|LMP|Ah, here we go. Watch this. Oh, my pencil fell off, but that's okay - .
143:30:59|T|CDR|Suppose you need that pencil.
143:31:01|T|LMP|Yeah. I can't even see the maps, much less the pencil.
143:31:06|T|CDR|Looks like you're in pretty good shape.
143:31:08|T|LMP|We need a map holder like a windshield wiper. You can power up, I'm - Wait a minute. Okay. Hooked. Let's go.
143:31:21|T|LMP|Okay. DAC's coming on.  Mark.
143:31:29|T|CDR|Okay, give me that first heading again, Charlie.
143:31:31|T|LMP|164.
143:31:44|C|Eng|Okay, good show. And even with all of that extra there, you're only leaving 2 minutes late. Outstanding.
143:31:55|T|CDR|You're kidding.  We must have forgot
143:32:17|T|CDR|Also, we see big white rocks with black
143:32:32|T|LMP|Okay. We've got a great view of all the way into Stone. We're right up on a ridge here, Tony. We're at 10 degrees bearing, 1.1 range.
143:32:40|T|LMP|the black with the whitish inclusion. We can see all the way to the base of
143:33:17|C|Eng|And Charlie, verify the DAC is on.
143:33:19|T|LMP|- that are a meter or so -  Yeah, I called DAC on.
143:33:25|C|Eng|Okay.
143:33:27|T|CDR|Uh-oh, Charlie. Charlie.
143:33:28|T|LMP|I feel it running.
143:33:30|C|Eng|Good show.
143:33:32|T|LMP|Okay. Now, Tony, we're going down an incline -
143:34:00|C|Eng|Okay. There were those mounds mapped over at Phantom area. Can you see those -
143:34:02|T|LMP|I think we're just now coming up on - (Stops to
143:34:10|C|Eng|In the area of Phantom Crater. That will be to your left at about - It will be about 10 o'clock now.
143:34:18|T|LMP|No. Phantom Crater's over a ridge. I think we're coming by <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">WC</a>, is what we're really coming by. Off to our 1 o'clock - Make it 3 o'clock now, 350 at 0.3.
143:34:29|C|Eng|Okay.
143:34:32|T|CDR|I think you're right, Charlie.
143:34:35|T|LMP|Okay. The largest blocks we see are a meter. The regolith seems to be loosely compacted, much like the regolith over at the - which is characteristic of all of the Cayley here. Most of the rocks are angular to subrounded.
143:34:59|C|Eng|Okay. Do you feel you're still in that ray?
143:35:02|T|LMP|still in this ray.
143:35:05|T|LM Crew|Yep.
143:35:07|T|CDR|Just covered with blocks and holes, Houston.
143:35:10|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.
143:35:12|T|LMP|Lots of secondaries, Tony.
143:35:15|T|CDR|Charlie, what are we shooting for?
143:35:18|T|LMP|Well, we're supposed to be one seven - Let's
143:35:24|C|Eng|Okay. The heading on the first leg is 162.
143:35:25|T|CDR|Houston, can you give us a range and first
143:35:32|T|LMP|For 1.3.
143:35:34|T|LMP|Okay, we've got 0.6 now. When we get there, we should be 353 at 1.3. We're traveling a little bit east. I think if
143:35:51|T|CDR|Yeah.
143:35:53|T|LMP|Hey, this is a great place to keep this map. Wedge it in that camera. Yeow! Whooo! Man, that was a great big skid. We're doing 10 clicks, Tony.
143:36:06|C|Eng|Outstanding.
143:36:07|T|LMP|Still down about a 2-to 3-degree slope now. Old
143:36:17|C|Eng|Do you have an Amps at max speed?
143:36:25|T|LMP|I can't tell you, I'm sitting in Volts right now.
143:36:29|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
143:36:30|T|LMP|the dust-covered rocks are mostly rounded. The angular rocks seem to be free of dust.
143:36:44|T|CDR|And there sure are a lot of rocks, Houston.
143:36:50|T|LMP|cobbly. Cobble size is still the same. Maybe 10 percent of the surface, now.  Tony, we forgot to say it, but we're starting out with the correct magazines, as per checklist.
143:37:10|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
143:37:15|T|LMP|Lot easier driving down here, isn't it, John? Not any real big craters. Lot of subdued -
143:37:22|T|CDR|Well, it's not any easier; it's just that you can
143:37:25|T|LMP|Yeah. But it didn't seem to be as rough, is what I thought. Okay. We're at 348 at 0.8 now, Tony.  Still in indurated secondaries.
143:37:46|C|Eng|Okay. You should be about halfway to Survey .
143:37:52|T|LMP|at 346 at 0.9. Slowing down to about 6 clicks.
143:38:31|T|LMP|That's gonna be a steep slope up there, John.
143:38:34|T|CDR|I believe it is, Charlie.
143:38:35|T|LMP|Up Stone.  Okay. We're looking for 35 - About - Okay, at 1.3 clicks, we should be on Survey at around 35 or so. Looks like that's Survey dead ahead, to me.
143:38:54|T|CDR|Looks like to me.
143:39:02|T|LMP|Tony, apparently this ray is pretty extensive. We haven't got out of this cobble field yet, and we're now 1.0 at 348
143:39:38|C|Eng|Okay. We understand that.
143:40:36|T|LMP|Golly. Covered me with dust on that one.
143:40:39|T|CDR|Sorry, Charlie.
143:40:40|T|LMP|That's okay.
143:40:42|T|LMP|That looks like a pretty good path off about 2 o'clock - 1 o'clock, John.
143:40:46|T|CDR|Yeah.
143:40:49|T|LMP|Okay. Now the percentage of cobbles is picking up, Tony, at 1.2 at 344 . And maybe now 20 percent of the surface is covered with cobbles up to 15 - make it 30 - centimeters, with the largest blocks being a meter size.  Looks like these larger ones are caused by - There's some craters here 5 meters or so that appear to me to be a series of secondaries right in this area.
143:41:36|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. You may bear back to the right about 10 degrees.
143:41:43|T|LMP|The rim of South -  Okay, I think that's a good plan. Okay. We'll do that. You can still see the rim of South Ray, spectacularly white. It just stands out above the surrounding terrain by an order of magnitude .
143:42:12|T|CDR|Okay, what's the heading down
143:42:43|C|Eng|Okay. Take plenty of Hasselblad pictures there.
143:42:46|T|LMP|Very blocky.
143:42:50|C|Eng|Got plenty of film.
143:42:51|T|LMP|I'm clicking them off as fast as my finger'll pull
143:42:53|C|Eng|Good show.
143:43:03|T|CDR|Uh-oh; watch it, Charlie.
143:43:16|C|Eng|Okay; 1.5. That's where we mapped you on top of Survey -
143:43:18|T|LMP|Tony, if we'd have gone -  Okay. If we'd have gone to 353 on Survey originally, we'd have been down in a big depression.
143:43:34|T|CDR|I'm still pretty depressed at this point.
143:43:36|T|LMP|Oh, man, John. This is really a ray; it just goes right in to South Ray.
143:43:40|T|CDR|Boy, you just can't believe the blocks, Houston. The block population on Survey, what is it, 50 percent?
143:43:47|T|LMP|Oh, I would say, estimating, 60 to 70. And you can track it right in, up across over the ridge that blocks out
143:44:25|T|CDR|Got to get out of these, Charlie.
143:44:27|T|LMP|No. I think - Yeah, the Rover's hacking it with no sweat over these little ones.
143:44:31|T|CDR|Yeah, but I mean - spend the rest of the day in that rille - ray.
143:44:39|T|LMP|Yeah. I think you can hook a right here a little bit, John. Looks pretty good.  There's really a lot of craters here, Tony, at 1.6 at 348 . The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-s.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">top of Survey</a> is just pockmarked. They're pretty subdued, though. We can drive through them up to 3-meter ones with no problem.  You're still making 6 clicks, John.   The characteristics of the rocks, Tony, are the same as around the lunar module.
143:45:13|C|Eng|Okay.  If you get a chance to look at the southeast side of Survey -
143:45:23|T|LMP|That's one of the white ones -
143:45:24|C|Eng|- you might see if you see any beds in there.
143:45:31|T|LMP|No, not a chance.
143:45:33|C|Eng|Okay.
143:45:36|T|LMP|It 's pretty well-rounded, Tony, and it just - The only predominant feature here is this ray pattern with all the secondaries.
143:45:44|C|Eng|Okay.
143:45:46|T|CDR|Best set of rocks you ever saw, I'll tell you that.
143:45:55|T|LMP|Boy, it'll be no trouble sampling the South Ray at Station 8; it looks like that this ray goes right across it.
143:46:03|C|Eng|Very good.
143:46:07|T|LMP|We're 1.7 now at 352 , and sort of back down in - Almost - We've dropped maybe 20 meters. Just passing a secondary that's 10 meters across.
143:46:23|C|Eng|Okay. You should see
143:46:30|T|LMP|Merriam would be down over the ridge.
143:46:33|C|Eng|Okay.
143:46:35|T|LMP|Man, there's a great split boulder right there.
143:46:40|T|CDR|Charlie.
143:46:42|T|LMP|It is. That was an
143:47:01|T|CDR|What should our heading be down here now,
143:47:04|T|LMP|Okay. We've still got to go three - This is the one that's two - From here up over is -
143:47:11|C|Eng|168.
143:47:12|T|LMP|- 227 for 0.4. We should be 005 at 1.6 to
143:47:25|T|LMP|We're at 1.8, but that's because we're a
143:47:37|C|Eng|All right. We think you could just about head south now -
143:47:44|T|LMP|Okay. We are. We're going 180. This is terrible, this ray, isn't it?
143:47:50|T|CDR|Yep. That's why I want to get out of it.
143:48:35|T|LMP|Boy, isn't it something?
143:48:36|T|CDR|This is really something!
143:48:38|T|LMP|You're still going 8 clicks, though, John. We're
143:49:23|T|CDR|Yeah.
143:49:24|T|LMP|Okay. Now you're headed right for it. And the
143:49:37|C|Eng|From where you are, Cinco should be right in line with Crown.
143:49:39|T|LMP|It is, Tony. Right now. We got it spotted.
143:49:45|C|Eng|Okay.
143:49:48|T|LMP|Got a little crater in the inner flank. Okay; doing 10 clicks, and still in the crater-saturated downslope of Survey Ridge at 354 at 2.2 . Block population is still the same.
143:50:21|T|CDR|Houston, the best idea I can give you of what this looks like, is it looks like about halfway up to that crater that we went to out at the Nevada Test Site . Man, I tell you, I've never seen so many blocks in my life.
143:50:37|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds like that was a good exercise then.
143:50:44|T|LMP|Good exercise in driving.
143:50:47|T|CDR|Oh, that was a baddie.
143:52:03|C|Eng|Okay, what's the bearing and range for that getting off the contact?
143:52:09|T|LMP|Okay, we'll give it to you. We're right now at 354 at 2.5 . We're still in a block field. It'll be about another 2 clicks before we're out of it.
143:52:24|T|CDR|Okay; I just don't think you can identify these things as contacts per se.
143:52:29|C|Eng|No, we understand.
143:52:30|T|CDR|They just fade out and then they go away.  Okay.
143:52:37|C|Eng|Okay, you're about 200 or 300 meters from the contact, as it's mapped, with the Descartes. Or the feathering out there. We'd like you to keep an eye out for any changes in regolith.
143:52:52|T|LMP|Okay, you got it, babe. And I think that's a pretty good guess as far - At least, that's where the slope of Stone starts.  That Stone Mountain looked like it was right on top of us, and we've come 2.6 kilometers and it still looks just as far away.
143:53:09|T|CDR|Yeah, it's really something.
143:53:15|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, characteristics are still the same as up on Survey. Ten percent cobbles, about the same size; maybe a smattering more of the larger ones, 50 centimeters and up.  Some of the rocks seem in good shape - hardly fractured - others appear to be badly fractured, but still homogeneous.
143:53:50|C|Eng|From your description, it sounds like we won't have any trouble finding split boulders at 8.
143:53:58|T|LMP|Well, I don't know. The -
143:54:02|T|CDR|I haven't seen but one split boulder so far. Not that I've been looking; but I would if there were some.
143:54:12|T|LMP|Hey, that was super. That wheel just left the ground.
143:54:23|T|CDR|This is the wildest ride I was ever on.
143:54:45|C|Eng|Sounds like you're really making money there.
143:55:04|T|LMP|Boy, it's a spectacular view looking out to the west, Tony. In fact, it looks like a whole mountain itself back to the west.
143:55:13|T|CDR|Yeah, I think -
143:55:18|T|LMP|And that poop about being able to see the LM all the way on Traverse 2, I think, was gonna be bum dope. We've come down some big swales.
143:55:30|C|Eng|Okay.
143:56:11|T|LMP|I can't give you any new words, Tony. The regolith
143:56:25|T|CDR|Nope.
143:56:26|T|LMP|Look at that pitch meter.
143:56:30|T|CDR|Maybe we have been climbing. I doubt it.
143:56:33|T|LMP|Pegged out high.
143:56:36|C|Eng|Okay. Charlie, we'd like -
143:56:38|T|CDR|
143:56:39|T|LMP|Here it comes.
143:56:39|C|Eng|- that DAC on 12 frames per second.
143:56:42|T|LMP|Okay. 12 frames a second, coming up. You got
143:56:49|C|Eng|Okay.
143:56:52|T|LMP|Okay, you're looking right at Cinco and - Tony,
143:57:07|C|Eng|Wow.
143:57:08|T|LMP|We're climbing up about a 10-degree slope now.
143:57:12|C|Eng|Okay.
143:57:14|T|LMP|And let's see, 6 was at 000 at -
143:57:21|T|CDR|Charlie, what should we be heading for?
143:57:23|T|LMP|Those craters up there.
143:57:24|T|CDR|Oh, don't tell me that. Where?
143:57:26|T|LMP|Okay, see that one that's sort of a funny shape.
143:57:32|T|CDR|Yeah.
143:57:33|T|LMP|That's it.
143:57:35|T|CDR|That one at 12 o'clock, huh?
143:57:36|T|LMP|Yeah.
143:57:37|T|CDR|Okay. Well, Houston, now that we get up to
143:57:50|T|LMP|I think this is one of our benches here, John.
143:57:53|T|CDR|Think it is, huh?
143:57:54|T|LMP|Yeah, we're at 3.3 , and 5 should be at 33 and - Okay, Tony; we're on a flat area now at 355 at 3.3 , and I think it apparently is a bench. We're passing Station 5; a little to the east.
143:58:15|C|Eng|Okay, glad you can recognize it there.
143:58:16|T|LMP|Yowie.
143:58:17|C|Eng|That's great.
143:58:30|C|Eng|Okay, you might look for a fresh crater that would punch through that ray material in the Descartes for Station 5 when you come back.
143:58:40|T|LMP|Okay, most of the craters here are - There's another
143:58:48|T|CDR|Look at old South Ray, Charlie.
143:58:50|T|LMP|That's beautiful. Just spectacular! I can't
143:58:58|T|CDR|See it?
143:59:19|T|CDR|Oh, man, this -
143:59:22|C|Eng|Okay, we'll keep that in mind.
143:59:25|T|LMP|And that should be a good Station 5.
143:59:29|C|Eng|Okay.
143:59:30|T|LMP|Man, we are really going up a hill, I'll tell
143:59:34|C|Eng|How about the traction?
143:59:35|T|CDR|Crown.
143:59:36|C|Eng|Are you slipping at all?
143:59:37|T|CDR|That's the only one I see I recognize.
143:59:39|T|LMP|Okay. See, over here by this oblong one - which I think is Cinco 'e', John - we go up a steep slope, but then it seems to level out right up on top.
143:59:48|T|CDR|Yeah.
143:59:49|T|LMP|Okay?
143:59:50|T|CDR|Yeah. Look at that bench in Crown.
143:59:52|T|LMP|I know it. No, we can't see Crown now.
143:59:55|T|CDR|What is that thing with a V in it?
143:59:56|T|LMP|That's Cinco E.
143:59:59|T|CDR|The one with the V in it?
144:00:00|T|LMP|Yeah.
144:00:02|T|CDR|Let's go sample it.
144:00:36|T|LMP|And we are going up a steep, steep slope, John.
144:00:38|C|Eng|We believe you, Charlie.
144:00:40|T|CDR|We are not.
144:00:43|T|LMP|And it's got black streaks coming out of it. Okay,
144:00:55|T|CDR|Yeah, Charlie.
144:00:58|T|LMP|This is going to be spectacular!! I can see
144:01:17|T|CDR|Yeah, we're getting up on a bench right now.
144:01:19|T|LMP|And, boy, this is going
144:01:35|T|CDR|See it anywhere, Charlie?
144:01:37|T|LMP|What? Cinco? Yeah, this is it. Here's the one,
144:01:43|C|Eng|Charlie, you probably are at one of the lower
144:01:52|T|LMP|Okay. We'll go on up.
144:01:59|T|CDR|A little easier driving uphill than down as far
144:02:02|C|Eng|And you're well ahead on the timeline. You've
144:02:04|T|CDR|just as long as you're going up.
144:02:07|T|LMP|Tony, I can see into -
144:02:10|T|CDR|Charlie, let's go up here to this big blocky
144:02:13|T|LMP|Where's that?
144:02:14|T|CDR|Right up there.
144:02:15|T|LMP|That's
144:02:16|T|CDR|You don't want to go up to there?
144:02:17|T|LMP|Yeah, that's fine with me. Look's like a pretty
144:02:21|T|CDR|No, it's not.  It might be.
144:02:30|T|LMP|I don't think I'm going to be able to see Stubby
144:02:35|T|CDR|Can you see it from here?
144:02:36|T|LMP|Yeah, I can see it now. Boy, it's a bad place to
144:02:49|T|LMP|We're in a pretty good right roll, Tony. About 5 to 10 degrees right roll, and climbing up a steep, steep slope.  And, John, here's a great bench right up here. It might be a crater. Just right in front of us about 20 meters. Why don't we stop there?
144:03:09|T|CDR|Right up there, you mean?
144:03:10|T|LMP|I'm talking about really right here. See this big block at about 1 o'clock - at 12:30?
144:03:18|T|CDR|Right here?
144:03:20|T|LMP|Yeah, right here.
144:03:24|T|CDR|
144:03:24|C|Eng|Okay. We concur with whatever blocky crater you
144:03:27|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead, go ahead.
144:03:31|T|CDR|Okay, because it's on a flat bench, too.
144:03:32|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay, we're at 4.0 at 355
144:03:33|C|Eng|And go ahead and park for a Nav update down-Sun,
144:03:40|T|LMP|Okay, super. And, Tony, I think we're up at just
144:03:46|C|Eng|Okay. The main thing is to make sure that we
144:03:52|T|LMP|Maybe not.
144:03:53|C|Eng|- to punch us through any ray material from
144:03:57|T|LMP|This one does. Don't worry. This is a 10-meter
144:04:08|C|Eng|Okay.
144:04:25|C|Eng|We think you're at one of the sharp Cincos.
144:04:26|T|LMP|Wow, that was a good choice.  I do, too. Hey, can't we get up there closer, right in that block , John? So we won't have so far to walk. Upslope. Seems to be a flat place about right up here.
144:04:47|T|CDR|Yeah. This almost flat?
144:04:50|T|LMP|Well, according to the pitch meter, it's not. It's pegged out.
144:04:57|C|Eng|Hey, fellows, Ken was just flying over, and he saw a flash on the side of the Descartes. He probably got a glint off you.
144:05:06|T|LMP|Yeah. That's us. Man, those mirrors are dusty.
144:05:14|T|CDR|I'm going up here, and set it in a crater so it doesn't go anywhere.
144:05:26|T|LMP|This looks pretty good. I don't think it 's going to go downslope. Tony, you can't believe it, this view looking back to the east . We see
144:05:54|C|Eng|Okay.
144:05:55|T|LMP|We can see the old lunar module! Look at that, John. Okay, 270 on the heading.
144:06:04|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I want to go back down there and park in that crater right there.
144:06:08|T|LMP|Okay. Okay.
144:06:11|T|CDR|See what I'm saying?
144:06:13|T|LMP|Yeah, okay. Looks like to me, from my side, if you just turn real sharp left, you'd have it. But that's fine with me.
144:06:19|T|CDR|It's not flat, Charlie. It's pointing too downhill.
144:06:22|T|LMP|Not sideways, it wouldn't be.
144:06:23|T|CDR|Huh?
144:06:24|T|LMP|Sideways. We got to park 270.  But that'd be fine. Why don't you go down there, John? You probably -  Watch that big rock! Ummm. Just cleared it. Which one are you going to park in?
144:06:52|T|CDR|That one right down there, with that block in it.
144:06:54|T|LMP|The right?
144:06:55|T|CDR|Yeah.
144:06:56|T|LMP|Okay.  That's a good overturnable one right there, John. Hey, we could roll that thing downhill.
144:07:26|T|LMP|Look at that beauty climb over those 1-meter blocks.
144:08:09|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're in real bad shape because our vehicle attitude indicator in roll - That's why you thought it was so pitched. The thing is broken, Charlie.
144:08:19|T|LMP|It is. Yeah.
144:08:26|C|Eng|Okay. On the SSD , can you estimate a roll well enough for an update?
144:08:37|T|CDR|I think we're rolled about 4 degrees left, and we're pitched down about, oh, 5 or 6.
144:08:45|C|Eng|Okay. And the SSD?
144:08:50|T|LMP|Okay. Sun shadow is 9 -
144:08:56|T|CDR|Nine degrees.
144:08:57|T|LMP|Left.
144:08:58|T|CDR|Left.
144:09:00|C|Eng|Okay. We copied 9 degrees -
144:09:02|T|CDR|
144:09:02|C|Eng|- And, Charlie, you want to check the DAC?
144:09:07|T|LMP|Okay. Checking it off. Stand by.
144:09:11|T|CDR|Charlie, whatever you do, don't hit that brake.
144:09:14|T|LMP|Okay.  John, it's pretty level, it seems like, right here!
144:09:24|T|CDR|Well, that's what I hope.
144:09:26|T|LMP|DAC's off, Tony.
144:09:28|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. And can we have your frame count?
144:09:33|T|LMP|Okay, the mag's empty on the DAC.  My frame count is 82.
144:09:41|C|Eng|Okay, we copy. Sounds good.
144:09:46|T|LMP|Okay, got the display. Okay, I'm around to get the 500 . Tony, you just can't believe this! You just can't believe this view! You can see the lunar module ; you can see North Ray with boulders on the southwest side; and where Station 12 is, there's one huge boulder that's going to be just great.
144:10:12|T|LMP|It looks like we can get up there , and there's a great ray pattern going up the side of Smoky Mountain from North Ray.
144:10:24|C|Eng|Sounds fantastic. That 500 millimeter should do a job for us.
144:10:29|T|LMP|Oh, I hope so. I can see super into -
144:10:37|T|CDR|Charlie, quit pushing this thing around.
144:10:52|T|CDR|Charlie, could you align the high gain? I can't reach it.
144:10:56|T|LMP|Okay, John. I got this roll thing working again.
144:10:59|T|CDR|You did, huh?
144:11:00|T|LMP|Yeah. Hold still, and let me - Okay, Tony. The roll - hit the thing. The roll is 4 degrees left. That was a great estimate on John's part. And the pitch scale is falling off, but the needle is in the center.
144:11:32|T|CDR|I'd say it's about - from my gravity gradients and looking at the LCRU - I'd say it's about 3 degrees pitched down.  4 degrees pitched down.
144:11:42|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
144:11:43|T|LMP|Oh, wait a minute. Do you want me to get the high gain.
144:11:46|T|CDR|Yeah.
144:11:51|C|Eng|And while you're playing around the LRV there, how about the Volt/Amp switched to Amp.
144:12:01|T|LMP|Okay, I did that. They're low.
144:12:04|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
144:12:12|T|LMP|Okay. We weren't pointed at it.
114:12:13|T|CDR|Charlie. It's too hard to do this way. We have to use the -
144:12:19|T|LMP|We can go at it from right here, John.
144:12:37|T|LMP|Ah ha! There's that beauty.
144:12:39|C|Eng|Hey, we've got a picture!
144:12:40|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. That thing's a piece of cake for aligning it at 270.
144:12:48|C|Eng|Okay, that's good news.
144:12:56|T|LMP|Okay, starting with the 500. I'm going to Intermediate - I mean, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Min position on the cooling</a>.
144:13:02|T|CDR|Okay, and &quot;dust&quot;.
144:13:06|T|LMP|Tony, you can see the rays of South Ray come out across the landscape, albedo-wise. And it's really predominant. They cross right across - Go right up Survey , and it's definitely ray pattern that we were crossing . Okay, &quot;500 of Stubby, 15 &quot; and - That's not worth 15 pictures, Tony.
144:13:39|C|Eng|And, John, before you start sampling -
144:13:42|T|LMP|Can't see much.
144:13:44|C|Eng|- could you give us a general impression of the rock types?
144:13:49|T|CDR|And, it looks to me like this rock pile that we're seeing in there is about the same type of rock. I -  As you can see, they're angular. Let me go over there and look at this big one.
144:14:10|T|CDR|I think they're right friable. They have a very shocked appearance. There's a boulder we could turn over, Charlie.
144:14:20|T|LMP|That's what I was saying. That a big one. Right behind us.
144:14:24|T|CDR|The trouble is, I don't want to push it into the Rover.
144:14:52|T|CDR|That's right, Charlie. That's what it says. And that's why your dark streaks show up on your photographs. It's not that that thing wasn't throwing out blocks in every which direction. That dark streak right down through the middle of our photograph - that looks the darkest in the area - is probably dark material from South Ray.
144:15:35|C|Eng|Okay, copy that.
144:15:36|T|LMP|No outcrop at all. I see some secondaries in the inner flank.
144:15:43|T|CDR|It doesn't look much different than the subdued craters that we've just come across.
144:16:05|T|CDR|Most of these rocks have a whitish cast to them, Houston, but -
144:16:13|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm up to frame count 90 on magazine Lima.
144:16:21|C|Eng|Okay.
144:16:30|T|CDR|It's absolutely unreal!
144:16:34|T|LMP|We've really come up here, Tony. It's just spectacular. Gosh, I have never seen - All I can say is &quot;spectacular&quot;, and I know y'all are sick of that word, but my vocabulary is so limited.
144:16:50|C|Eng|We're darn near speechless down here -
144:16:51|T|LMP|Okay, we got the description -  Can you guys see how really spectacular the view is?
144:16:59|C|Eng|We sure can.
144:17:02|T|LMP|Hey, yeah. Where's the big eye?  There it comes.
144:17:05|C|Eng|We're looking at you.
144:17:08|T|LMP|Look upslope, Tony. Okay, look on upslope, and you see all this rock field that we're in here.  Okay. Anyway, I'll put the rake - The rake's coming next, John .
144:17:21|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead. Then we need a pan. That's after penetrations; and then I've got to get the - Guess what's coming up? I can almost pick this thing off the ground.
144:17:35|T|LMP|That thing doesn't look like it's too stable.
144:17:37|T|CDR|What's that?
144:17:38|T|LMP|This back wheel's off the ground! The Rover. The right rear wheel is off the ground.
144:17:56|C|Eng|Yeah, Charlie. If you get a chance, we would like it dusted.
144:17:58|T|LMP|I'll get the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-lensbrush.html" target="alsj">lens brush</a>.  Yeah, it looks really dusty, Tony. Just a minute.
144:18:08|C|Eng|Okay. These blocks we see lying around the surface, are most of them from <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp015.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">South Ray</a>?
144:18:16|T|LMP|-   Boy, I'll tell you, Tony. I just came up about a 20-degree slope, and it is really loosely compacted here. Stand by. I'm going to swing the big eye around. I can't dust unless I do that.
144:18:38|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I've got a hard rock. I think it's glass coated, but it's so dust covered I can't tell, and it's going in bag 394.
144:18:50|C|Eng|Okay, 394.
144:18:58|T|LMP|The block population here - Okay, you're all dusted, Houston.
144:19:01|C|Eng|Thank you much, Charlie.
144:19:02|T|LMP|The block population here in this immediate area is 60 to 70 percent , with the biggest one being right in our little crater here - and that 's a meter or so. They're all very angular; but the prime size - The majority of them are less than, oh, less than 30 centimeters or so. Though there's a good proportion of 50 -
144:19:35|T|CDR|Let me put this in your bag, Charlie.
144:19:37|T|LMP|Okay, coming around. Got to get the rake.  Most of them are dust covered, Tony. Well, not most of them; in fact, most of them are not dust covered. The one that I'm just kicking - The ones around I kicked up.
144:19:56|T|CDR|Got the rake?
144:19:58|T|LMP|Yeah, I got it.
144:20:00|T|CDR|Shovel.
144:20:01|T|LMP|Okay.
144:20:03|T|CDR|No, we don't need the shovel. You want to use that thing, or do you want me to use the rake?
144:20:05|T|LMP|Let me rake this time and then I'll get on with the penetrometer, okay?
144:20:09|T|CDR|Okay, fine.
144:20:10|T|LMP|Okay, you want to - Where do you want to go? There's a place right up here, John, that looks like it's a good -
144:20:16|T|CDR|Okay, let's not go too far.
144:20:18|T|LMP|I'm not. It's pretty steep. If you jackrabbit up it, it's pretty easy to do.
144:20:55|T|CDR|Man.
144:21:12|T|LMP|Okay, I'm gonna change this, just to - Okay, Tony. Underneath this regolith up here, we've still got the same deal. Top centimeter or so is -
144:21:24|T|CDR|Charlie, rake.
144:21:25|T|LMP|I'm sorry.
144:21:37|T|CDR|Okay. Most of these rocks are white clasts.
144:21:43|T|LMP|Glass coated, too, a little -
144:21:45|T|CDR|Yeah, glass coated.
144:21:46|T|LMP|On some of them.
144:21:50|T|CDR|There's 12 or 13 in that first scoop, and they're mostly white-clast rocks.
144:22:00|T|LMP|Here comes one that's got a lot of glass on it, John.
144:22:08|T|CDR|Okay, that ought to be enough.
144:22:10|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. You think you're getting breccias there, then?
144:22:15|T|LMP|Okay.
144:22:17|T|CDR|No, we're not sure because they're dust coated, too; and there's glass on them. They could be just shocked rock.
144:22:25|C|Eng|Okay.
144:22:27|T|CDR|Okay, that's going into bag 395.
144:22:30|T|LMP|I don't get the impression -
144:22:31|C|Eng|Okay, 335 .
144:22:33|T|LMP|- they're breccias, myself.
144:22:34|T|CDR|I don't either. But it's just an impression.
144:22:48|T|LMP|Man. Boy, oh, boy. I can't believe this. Okay; you want to get an 'after' of that, John? I'll get a shovelful .
144:22:55|T|LMP|Okay.
144:23:03|C|Eng|And, John, we'd like to consider your going to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">Intermediate cooling</a>.
144:23:08|T|CDR|Oh, okay. We'll do it.
144:23:13|T|LMP|really don't need Intermediate. You need - At least, I'm comfortable just out of Min. Let's see, we need a some more of that, don't we?
144:23:21|T|CDR|Yeah.
144:23:22|T|LMP|They wanted a kilo. Okay.
144:23:28|T|CDR|Wow -
144:23:29|T|LMP|Okay; there's some of that white stuff in the bottom.
144:23:31|T|CDR|Yeah. Look at that.
144:23:32|T|LMP|That's what I was going to say. Tony, underneath this top gray layer, it's white again up here, just like on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp015.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cayley </a>.
144:23:40|C|Eng|Okay.
144:23:42|T|LMP|John, that's a kilo, isn't it?
144:23:44|T|CDR|Yeah.
144:23:45|C|Eng|Yeah, that's a kilo.
144:23:56|T|CDR|Okay, that's in bag 396.
144:23:58|C|Eng|Okay, 396.
144:24:04|T|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry, John. I ran off and left you.
144:24:06|T|CDR|Now, you want me to throw it - Throw it in my bag.
144:24:09|T|LMP|Okay.
144:24:10|T|CDR|Well, there's probably so many core tubes in there -
144:24:11|T|LMP|No, you've got core tubes. Let me carry the rocks. I have an easier time getting the core tubes out if your bag is empty.
144:24:18|T|CDR|Okay.
144:24:19|T|LMP|Look at that view over there. Look at that.
144:24:21|T|CDR|You've got two core tubes too, Charlie. Did you mean to have two of them?
144:24:24|C|Eng|Hey, Charlie. We're having a hard time getting -
144:24:26|T|LMP|No, bag - . Okay.
144:24:27|C|Eng|- a perspective on that crater. Could you give us the dimensions, please?
144:24:31|T|LMP|Where we're standing?
144:24:32|C|Eng|Right.
144:24:36|T|LMP|What do you think? 10 meters, John?
144:24:59|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. On the penetrometer, it's benched. We'll call this crater &quot;the bench&quot; if you want to, and I'll get one uphill, one downhill, and two in the bottom of the crater. How does that sound?
144:25:13|C|Eng|Okay, that sounds good to us.
144:25:19|T|LMP|Okay, and I'll start with a 0.5 .
144:25:20|C|Eng|Okay.
144:25:29|T|LMP|John, I'm glad we got those two core tubes. I think the other two fell off back at the LM.
144:25:35|T|CDR|Okay.
144:25:37|T|LMP|I don't think I ever put those back in your bag. Did I? Well, we'll see; we got plenty.
144:26:24|T|LMP|Okay, I'm going to take my camera off to do this .
144:26:33|T|LMP|Boy, this is so neat. Ha! Man, am I having a good time.
144:26:41|C|Eng|Charlie, we are, too.  And while you're bouncing around there, you might keep an eye out for a nearby crater that looks like it may have pulled up some local material.
144:27:04|T|LMP|Now, we can't walk very far, Tony.
144:27:07|C|Eng|Understand.
144:27:12|T|LMP|Oh, rats.
144:27:14|T|CDR|What's the matter, Charlie?
144:27:19|T|LMP|I had the 0.5 cone in here, and when I pulled it, I pulled it out, and it came out like it was supposed to. And then I started moving the thing down and it fell off.   what to do about that.
144:28:07|T|LMP|John, don't walk right over here. That cone is over there, and I want to get it out.
144:28:14|T|CDR|Hand me a set of tongs, too, will you?
144:28:16|T|LMP|Okay, here you go.
144:28:22|T|CDR|Okay. Once you get it out, can you put it back on?
144:28:24|T|LMP|Well, I'll bring it over to you, and if you'll hold it for me, I think I can.
144:28:50|T|LMP|How about whacking it on here, and see if you can get some of the dirt out of the bottom of it? Dadgum thing is not supposed to come out of there without being locked. My penetrometer is around here; wait a minute.
144:28:59|T|CDR|Okay.
144:29:05|T|LMP|Okay.
144:29:12|T|LMP|Oh, yeah. I see it. A whole big bubble of it, isn't it?
144:29:16|T|CDR|Yeah.
144:29:18|T|LMP|Is that on? Yeah, that got it. Thank you. Beautiful. Okay.
144:29:25|T|CDR|I'm going to grab sample this scrap - this glass splatter behind the Rover, Houston.
144:29:33|T|LMP|Good. Hey, Tony - John, if you see it, there's one under that rock. Is that the one you're talking about?
144:29:40|T|CDR|Yeah.
144:29:41|T|LMP|Okay.
144:29:42|T|LMP|Tony, can I start on number 5 on the penetrometer?
144:29:44|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine.
144:29:49|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going up out of this crater, up on the top part of it.
144:29:57|T|CDR|And that's going into bag 397, Houston.
144:30:00|C|Eng|Okay, 397.
144:30:05|T|LMP|Tony, you just can't believe that South Ray Crater. It is perfectly cylindrical - circular. And it's amazing. It's just really apparent that we got two types of rocks there.
144:30:05|T|LMP|Okay, I'm up on the side now, starting with 5. And we're pushing it in.  Okay. That's as far as it's gonna go, Tony. And it went to half - about three-quarters of the way up to the red mark.
144:31:08|C|Eng|Okay.  Okay.  We'd like you to -
144:31:16|T|LMP|going back down in the flat part.
144:31:18|C|Eng|- change to two tenths.
144:31:22|T|LMP|Okay.
144:31:23|T|LMP|And, Tony, when you push on the thing, you can't push with a very smooth force, and you're gonna see some spikes on the recording, I'm sure.
144:31:40|C|Eng|Okay. We understand that. That's fine, Charlie.
144:31:45|T|LMP|And if you want my opinion on the thing, I don't think we're hitting hard ground. I think what I did is probably hit a rock, and I should have probably moved this thing over a little bit.
144:31:59|C|Eng|Okay. We'll just go with the 0.2 and see how that does.
144:32:04|T|LMP|Okay.
144:32:15|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm sampling independently, and I've got four samples in bag 398. They're so dust covered that I can't tell anything about them.
144:32:24|C|Eng|Okay; understand.
144:32:36|T|CDR|Charlie, I'm going to get that bag out from underneath your seat and put the samples in there.
144:32:39|T|LMP|Okay. You know, John, with all these rocks here, I'm not sure we're getting Descartes.
144:32:47|T|CDR|That's right. I'm not either.
144:32:48|T|LMP|We ought to go down to a crater without any rocks.
144:32:59|C|Eng|And, Charlie, you're on the big eye. We're watching.
144:33:01|T|LMP|Okay, the two-tenths -  The two-tenths - You see that? The 0.2 went all the way in.
144:33:07|C|Eng|We understand. Can you tell how far it stroked up on the pressure? Do you think it reached the hilt?
144:33:16|T|LMP|No, it was very light pressure, frankly.
144:33:22|T|LMP|Maybe it just depends on whether you hit a rock down there or not. This is really loosely consolidated. This regolith. Loosely packed.
144:33:36|C|Eng|Okay. Was that index on 6?
144:33:41|T|LMP|That's affirm. Going to 7.
144:33:48|T|CDR|You don't mind if I put those bags in your seat, do you, Charlie?
144:33:51|T|LMP|Not a bit.
144:33:55|T|LMP|Hey, turn the big eye up to the right, Tony, if you want to watch this other one.
144:34:02|C|Eng|Okay, we're coming around.
144:34:12|T|LMP|This seems a little more firmly packed here.
144:34:15|C|Eng|Okay.
144:34:23|T|LMP|Okay, that one bottomed out, now, at -
144:34:26|C|Eng|Good show.
144:34:28|T|LMP|Oh, it's up above the red mark.
144:34:34|T|LMP|And it got progressively harder . So I think that was a good reading. I don't think that was necessarily a rock down there.
144:34:42|C|Eng|Good show. We finally guessed right .
144:34:49|T|LMP|Okay. Going to 8 and I'm going downslope.
144:35:02|T|LMP|John, this crater over here looks like it might be - just downslope here - looks like it might be one of the Cincos, and it could be Descartes material, because it's just some little blocks around it. And there's some little blocks inside the rim, too.
144:35:24|T|LMP|Okay. Here we go.
144:35:41|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, John.
144:35:43|T|CDR|No, it's sure not. I mean 'the material is not white'. It's just the same as it -
144:35:51|T|LMP|Aghh, rats!
144:35:56|T|LMP|How'd you like that?
144:35:57|C|Eng|Beautiful maneuver there, Charlie. What do you do for an encore?
144:36:02|T|LMP|Okay. This thing is -  Okay. I went - I went down - That one bottomed out.
144:36:10|C|Eng|Okay. We saw that.
144:36:12|T|LMP|But it went all the way in. I mean the force.
144:36:19|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I've gone down about a shovel width, and it's all the same material. And I don't see any layering in it or anything.
144:36:44|C|Eng|Okay. We understand that, John.
144:36:50|T|LMP|Okay. I've sequenced to number 9, and I'm stowing this beauty.
144:36:56|C|Eng|Okay.
144:37:01|T|LMP|And that one test, downhill, was on the steepest part.
144:37:06|C|Eng|Okay.
144:37:09|T|LMP|Tony, when I push that beauty in there, it almost turns the Rover over.  Tony, do you want this double core in the bench here or downslope where I think is probably closer to Descartes?
144:37:43|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I've got a sample out of the deepest part of this trench that I'm digging, and it's going into bag -  Bag 399.
144:38:01|C|Eng|Okay; bag 399.
144:38:13|T|LMP|Did you copy that, Tony? My question?
144:38:16|C|Eng|Right, Charlie. Why don't we just go ahead and take it downslope there about your last penetrometer place?
144:38:24|T|LMP|Okay, will do.
144:38:31|T|LMP|Okay, John, I'm going to come over there -
144:38:34|T|CDR|What do you need, Charlie?
144:38:35|T|LMP|- and get a couple of cores from you.
144:38:53|T|CDR|I wish I could say these rocks look different, Houston, but they don't. They look .
144:38:58|C|Eng|Okay. We understand. And do you see a blocky rim crater within walking distance?
144:39:20|T|CDR|Blocky rim.
144:39:21|T|LMP|But what is this one?
144:39:22|T|CDR|How about right up there, Charlie?
144:39:23|T|LMP|Yeah. That was one right up there. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's 30 meters away, up there. Getting out of this little crater is pretty - pretty hard; but after that I think you'll be able to hack it.  Okay. I've got an upper and a lower.   You guys looking at the scenery?
144:39:52|C|Eng|We sure are. It's really outstanding.
144:39:57|T|LMP|Pretty view from up - Have you seen the lunar module? You shoot 12 o'clock right now on the TV.
144:40:03|T|CDR|How much time we got here?
144:40:06|C|Eng|Okay. You've got about 22 minutes left.
144:40:09|T|LMP|We've got 58 total, John.
144:40:12|T|CDR|Okay.
144:40:16|C|Eng|No. We don't have the resolution to see the LM.
144:40:23|T|CDR|Charlie, get a picture of the LM.
144:40:25|T|LMP|I did, with the 500.
144:40:26|T|CDR|Okay.
144:40:57|T|LMP|Don't poop yourself, John.
144:40:59|T|CDR|Not doing any work, Charlie.
144:41:56|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Here's some blocky-rimmed secondary. Here's a nice little one.
144:42:04|C|Eng|Okay, John. That might be a good place to get a rock. We're really looking for one where the rock around the crater should come from the crater; not from the secondary.
144:42:19|T|CDR|Yeah. I would susppose that all of the - Do you think all the blocks on the upslope side were the secondary that made it? Don't you reckon, if it's from South Ray? Let me go down and sample off the rim - off the south rim.
144:42:34|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds good.
144:42:35|T|CDR|How about that?
144:42:36|C|Eng|Sounds good.
144:42:39|T|CDR|I think you really need a primary impact crater to avoid the problem.
144:42:47|C|Eng|Yeah. You're right, John.
144:43:31|C|Eng|Okay. I understand.
144:43:45|C|Eng|That's okay.
144:43:47|T|LMP|It'll save me some work.
144:44:00|T|LMP|I've been hammering on the railroad, all -  Okay, Tony, about halfway up the second one. It's getting a little harder, but it's going on in.
144:44:18|C|Eng|Okay. Maybe we're getting down to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp008.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Descartes</a> there.
144:44:27|T|LMP|That might be.  Boy, those <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">rays from South Ray</a> you can just track right across, through Stubby, right on up to Survey.
144:44:45|T|LMP|You know, Tony, South Ray was <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16_lpi_trvrsmap.gif" title="image" target="alsj">mapped</a> as as big a crater as North Ray, and it's not nearly as big. It's just the ray pattern - the whiteness - that makes it look as big.
144:44:56|T|CDR|No, Charlie. It wasn't.
144:45:02|T|CDR|It was when we started , but when we got -  Okay, Houston. I'm standing on the rim of this crater over here. The only - the only rock I see on the south rim of this obvious secondary is not too big. I can get down into the crater and look down in it, and see if I can scratch away to a bench, if you'd like to do that.
144:45:43|C|Eng|Okay. I don't think we need to do that, John. Charlie will bring up a rake there; and, maybe from that, we'll be able to get Descartes.
144:45:53|T|LMP|&quot;I'll bring up a rake.&quot; Thanks.
144:45:59|T|CDR|Are you getting a rake, Charlie?
144:46:01|T|LMP|I'm finishing up the double core right now. I've got it back here, and I'm taking it apart.
144:46:03|T|CDR|Okay.
144:46:11|T|LMP|Capped; bottom section.
144:46:22|C|Eng|And, Charlie, did you call off the section numbers?
144:46:25|T|CDR|Okay; again, that rock again is going to be -
144:46:28|T|LMP|No, not yet. I'll get them.  Okay. That's full. Bottom section was 38, Tony.
144:46:38|C|Eng|Okay.
144:46:49|T|LMP|Man, this is working neat. Those things are just going right back on.  Okay. It's all rammed home.
144:47:05|T|CDR|What I'll do, Houston, is get a soil sample off this rim. That's the only thing I can be assured of that's Descartes right at this point.
144:47:16|C|Eng|Okay.
144:47:20|T|CDR|That's going in bag 400.
144:47:23|C|Eng|Okay; bag 400.
144:47:31|T|LMP|Okay. Top section, Tony, is number 43. Pass on.
144:47:42|T|CDR|Charlie.
144:47:46|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. Is that 23?
144:47:49|T|LMP|43; four three.
144:47:51|C|Eng|Okay; copy.
144:47:52|T|CDR|Okay. From this vantage, Houston, I'd like to shoot a pan -
144:47:59|C|Eng|Have at it, John.
144:48:30|T|CDR|I tell you, this is a graphic illustration of a secondary from South Ray, though,  and it'll show up good if I can bend over good enough to get it.
144:48:47|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the double core is under my seat
144:48:50|C|Eng|Okay.
144:48:51|T|LMP|All finished. Hey, do you really want me to grab the rake, Tony? I got to go up and help John?
144:49:03|C|Eng|We're getting that , Charlie.
144:49:06|T|LMP|Say again.
144:49:07|C|Eng|Okay. Yeah, we'd like you to take the rake on up there.
144:49:12|T|LMP|Okay.  putting it together now.  Fred Haise gets a 6-months' supply for thinking of that rake thing. That is really neat!
144:49:35|T|CDR|I'll tell you one thing, we're sure up in the air.
144:49:39|T|LMP|Yep.
144:49:53|C|Eng|That makes a pretty good TV picture standing up there. The big eye is on ya'.
144:50:01|T|CDR|Roger. I'm just trying to figure out - Dadgummit! You know where we landed? Charlie/Alpha 81!
144:50:11|T|LMP|What?
144:50:12|T|CDR|Charlie/Alpha 81. We're about 200 meters north of Double Spot.
144:50:21|T|LMP|Yeah. There's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-c.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Double Spot</a>.
144:50:22|T|CDR|Darn right.
144:50:23|T|LMP|Exactly north of Double Spot, John.
144:50:25|T|CDR|Well, I'll be doggoned.
144:50:28|T|LMP|That's where the L&amp;A says we're going to land!
144:50:31|T|CDR|I knew we made some kind of a mistake .
144:50:36|T|LMP|Man, this is tough going, ain't it?.
144:50:39|T|CDR|That is absolutely remarkable.
144:50:43|T|LMP|Hey, John, did you make those little footprints here around in this - ? Yeah, I guess you did
144:50:48|T|CDR|No, sir. I didn't. I came across that ridge there, and I don't advise you to get down in there either.
144:50:56|T|LMP|Man, this is steep. Okay. Where do you want the -
144:51:00|T|CDR|Well, on the rim, I think, Charlie.
144:51:01|T|LMP|Why don't we get outside the rim? That would be definitely Descartes. Right down here. Okay -
144:51:05|T|CDR|The object is to get the stuff that's been knocked out of the ground and landed on the rim.
144:51:10|T|LMP|Yeah, I know it, but I thought that would definitely - We could say that would be definitely - Okay, I'll sample right up here.
144:51:17|T|LMP|That's a definite secondary right there, isn't it?
144:51:19|T|CDR|Boy, I mean to tell you if that's not - I never saw one.
144:51:26|T|LMP|Okay. This is -
144:51:27|T|CDR|Hank Moore would love to see that.
144:51:30|T|LMP|Yeah. Whew! Hey, let me take it easy now. I'm pooped.
144:51:37|T|CDR|Yeah. Just slow down. Let me get the rake sample, Charlie.  Get it.
144:51:43|T|LMP|Okay. There's a - lots of goodies right there on the inner rim.
144:51:48|T|CDR|Yeah. Yeah. That's where I'll rake, right there. Okay?
144:51:53|T|LMP|Okay. Don't fall into that mutha. Excuse me.
144:51:59|T|CDR|Pretty good size, isn't it?
144:52:14|T|LMP|See if you can get - That's a clod. That's an indurated clod .
144:52:21|T|LMP|Here's some rocks. Good deal, boy. That's great!  Wait a minute; let's fill this one up, and then -  Hey, John, watch it.  Is that okay for you?
144:52:32|T|CDR|Wait a minute.
144:52:36|T|LMP|Super. Got them, every one, in there.
144:52:40|T|CDR|Okay.
144:52:41|T|LMP|Okay. Real dust-covered, mostly centimeter size, Tony. About 15 frags. Some smaller than that.
144:52:52|T|CDR|I've already got my shovel full here, Charlie.
144:52:54|T|LMP|Okay. Of the dirt?
144:53:01|T|LMP|I hate to tell you this, but I think it's indurated regolith.
144:53:06|T|CDR|-
144:53:07|T|LMP|Because I'm just breaking it up.
144:53:10|T|CDR|Very friable, Houston. Like dirt clods. Which is probably what it is. Want to get another one?
144:53:19|T|LMP|Yeah. Can you try another one? You copy that, Tony?
144:53:25|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
144:53:28|T|LMP|I don't think these are rocks. If they are, they are very friable. Think it's just indurated regolith.
144:53:38|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.
144:53:40|T|CDR|Well, there may be a rock or two in there.
144:53:44|T|LMP|Wait a minute. You got to get them all to one corner , John. There you go. Okay.  That's got it.
144:53:55|T|CDR|Maybe some of them are rocks. Okay, Houston. That was three scoops, and we're not documenting this to the best of our ability, because I think we're standing too close to the rim here to -
144:54:09|T|LMP|Down-Sun, I'd be in big hole.
144:54:12|T|CDR|If Charlie goes down-Sun to take the picture, we're in trouble.
144:54:15|C|Eng|All right. We can see that.
144:54:17|T|CDR|It ought to be in the pan.
144:54:18|C|Eng|Right. We see it.
144:54:31|T|LMP|That was in bag 401, Tony.
144:54:34|C|Eng|Okay, 401.
144:54:37|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay, Tony. You want us to get the - We can get the dense rocks here for the padded bags . There's plenty of them around, but they'll probably be out of South Ray. All these blocks that we see here came out of this secondary.
144:54:54|T|CDR|Yep.
144:54:55|T|LMP|Every one.
144:54:56|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.  We'll collect -
144:55:02|T|LMP|Okay, what does that mean? You want us to get -
144:55:02|C|Eng|- the padded bags back near the Rover. There's no point in going back up there.
144:55:08|T|LMP|Okay. Well, that's what we're going to do. I just wondered if secondary was okay for you.
144:55:14|C|Eng|Okay. We're getting them to work it. We will need a second pan in the area of the penetrations there.
144:55:24|T|LMP|I'll do that.
144:55:26|T|LMP|Boy, it is loose on your footing here, John. I feel like I'm really sinking in.
144:55:35|T|CDR|Charlie, you really are.  Boy, is this ever neat! If I could just figure out some way to keep my hands closed .
144:55:51|T|LMP|Yeah. That's the hard part about it, isn't it?
144:55:54|T|LMP|You know, John, that black stuff is glass - on those rocks.
144:55:57|T|CDR|Sure it is. That's what I said.
144:55:59|T|LMP|Yeah.
144:56:04|C|Eng|Okay, fellows, we'd like to get you packed up there. We'll save the padded bags for later.
144:56:11|T|CDR|Okay.
144:56:15|C|Eng|And your gyro is good. We won't need to torque it.
144:56:17|T|LMP|I think we have enough rocks from the South Ray.
144:56:23|T|CDR|Okay.
144:56:36|T|CDR|Okay. I'll go ahead and pack up, Charlie.
144:56:38|T|LMP|Okay.
144:57:15|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
144:57:18|C|Eng|Right; go ahead.
144:57:20|T|LMP|Okay, will do.
144:57:21|C|Eng|Should be mag R.
144:57:25|T|LMP|Okay. Man, if I get the top of this one in that picture, it's going to be a miracle.
144:57:44|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Doing this pan, I've moved about 2 feet downslope, so I don't know that things are going to match up too well or not.
144:57:51|C|Eng|Ah, we'll make it work.
144:57:55|T|LMP|Okay. And, after that pan, I'll be leaving here with frame count 110.
144:58:02|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie; 110.
144:58:12|T|LMP|You dog, you!
144:58:14|T|CDR|What are you talking about? Did you drop it, Charlie?
144:58:15|T|LMP|Yeah, but I got it. Get downslope here, and it's a piece of cake.
144:58:20|T|CDR|Yeah, it is.
144:58:22|C|Eng|And we'd like EMU check before you take off.
144:58:23|T|CDR|I'm putting it under your seat. I don't think it's going to -  Okay. I'm reading 3.85. I have no flags. I'm down to 68 percent on the O2.  Make that 63 percent. No, 68 was right. And I'm on - in there <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">between Intermediate and Minimum cooling</a>.
144:59:05|T|LMP|Okay. I'm at 70 percent, clear flags, 3.85, and I got just out of Medium - correction just out of Min. I got it, John.
144:59:38|T|LMP|Tony, what - How'd the metabolic rate look there?
144:59:45|C|Eng|Okay. Y'all look very good.
144:59:53|T|LMP|Okay. Thank you. Okay. And as we leave Cinco Crater, we bid a fond farewell.
145:00:06|C|Eng|Okay; and, John, we'll need a frame count from you.
145:00:08|T|LMP|Okay, Tony -
145:00:13|T|CDR|Okay. My frame count is 76, magazine Charlie.
145:00:19|T|LMP|John, could you give me magazine Romeo?
145:00:22|T|CDR|Yep.
145:00:24|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. I think on this next one we ought to stop away from any boulders down at 5, so we can get some <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp014.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Descartes</a>.
145:00:40|C|Eng|Right, we're -
145:00:41|T|CDR|Is that where you got Romeo from, Charlie?
145:00:42|T|LMP|Yeah. That's fine.
145:00:43|C|Eng|We agree that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp241.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Station 5</a>'s a key station now. We have a pad vector to get you to the crater that you called out on the way up , but it's up to you on what you think is the best place to be sure of getting Descartes.
145:01:00|T|CDR|We got ya .
145:01:03|T|LMP|Okay. We could move 40 feet -  50 meters downslope, and I think we'd have Descartes, but we'll look. Okay. Ready, John?
145:01:17|T|LMP|Okay; I've got the frame count. DAC's mag's R. Padded bags we're skipping. Okay; DAC, f/8, 250. Got to change that.
145:01:29|T|CDR|Okay, going Mode switch to 1 , Houston; and the TV CCW .
145:01:35|C|Eng|Okay. That 50 meters downslope you described, is that a blocky rim crater, or why do you think that is Descartes?
145:01:44|T|LMP|Because there's no blocks around it at all.
145:01:48|T|CDR|It's just an old subdued crater.
145:02:09|C|Eng|Okay. The vector will be 352 heading and seven tenths
145:02:11|T|LMP|John, look in the - there. Do you see -
145:02:20|T|CDR|Okay.
145:02:22|C|Eng|Does that look like the best bet to you?  What we're looking for -
145:02:28|T|LMP|That seems to be about it -
145:02:29|C|Eng|- is a primary impact - <p>
145:02:30|T|CDR|Charlie.   Say again.
145:02:42|T|LMP|What they're looking for is a primary impact crater in Descartes.
145:02:43|C|Eng|What we're looking for is a primary impact at blocky rim crater.
145:02:49|T|CDR|Understand.
145:02:52|T|LMP|Suppose we give you a primary impact with no block?  Wait a minute, John. I can't find this seatbelt. There we go.
145:03:10|C|Eng|And we don't want one without blocks. It'll almost have to be blocky.
145:03:19|T|CDR|You all ready to go, Charlie?
145:03:23|T|CDR|Okay; now watch my arm now. Okay? Don't hit my arm.
145:03:30|T|LMP|Okay, wait a minute. I don't feel it running.
145:03:50|T|CDR|We'll have to get it next time.
145:03:55|T|LMP|Must not have the mag in there right because it's not running.
145:04:01|T|CDR|Can't fix it without getting out.  Don't, don't. Let's worry about that when we get to the station.
145:04:11|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the camera's not running this time. I'll fix it when we get down to 5. You won't miss much.
145:04:17|C|Eng|Okay; fine.
145:04:31|T|LMP|And this is going to be sporty! See that string of - excuse me, John - see that string of secondaries in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Stubby</a>?
145:04:42|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:04:43|T|LMP|On the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-s.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">south flank of Stubby</a>?
145:04:45|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:04:48|T|LMP|Okay; I think, at seven tenths , we are starting at four-oh . Five-two .
145:04:54|T|LMP|Okay, what should our bearing and range be back to the LM, Tony, when we hit that crater?
145:05:03|C|Eng|Okay, it'll be 3 -
145:05:05|T|LMP|The one we came -
145:05:07|C|Eng|Right; it'll be 354 at 3.4.
145:05:25|T|CDR|As long as the brakes hold out -
145:05:26|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:05:27|T|CDR|- it's going to be easy, Charlie.
145:05:28|T|LMP|Have you got the brakes on?
145:05:29|T|CDR|Partially.
145:05:31|T|LMP|Isn't that something?
145:05:32|T|CDR|Have to.
145:05:33|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:05:52|T|CDR|Okay. What was the heading and distance to that -
145:05:54|T|LMP|354 for 3.4.  You know, it was really not apparent we were climbing this steep a slope.
145:06:14|T|CDR|354 for 0.4?
145:06:17|T|LMP|3.4.
145:06:19|C|Eng|Okay, that's the bearing and range that -
145:06:20|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, was that bearing and range - Was that at Stop 5 -
145:06:24|C|Eng|Okay, the heading and distance -
145:06:25|T|LMP|Okay, stop 5. Roger.
145:06:28|C|Eng|- is 352 at 0.7.
145:06:33|T|LMP|Okay, we've got a 354 bearing back to the LM right now, so we'll just keep on that.
145:06:38|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds good.
145:06:58|T|LMP|Man, John. You're doing a great job! Okay, Tony, coming back downslope 354 at 3.8 is about the same stuff.
145:07:13|C|Eng|Okay.
145:07:35|T|LMP|We're going back down our tracks, Tony.
145:07:36|T|CDR|Only way to fly, Tony.
145:07:37|C|Eng|I understand.
145:07:39|T|CDR|Charlie, you said you were going to see some other tracks on the Moon.
145:07:43|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:07:44|T|LMP|That big crater I was thinking about is right back there, it looks like.
145:07:52|T|CDR|No wonder we broke the pitch meter. Just as well we did.
145:07:55|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:07:56|T|CDR|Ya-ho-ho-ho-ho.  Look at this baby. I'm really getting confidence in it now. It's really humming like a kitten.
145:08:07|T|LMP|Oh, this machine is super.
145:08:08|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:08:13|C|Eng|Probably a good idea you couldn't see how steep it was going up.
145:08:18|T|CDR|Darn right it was.  Okay. I've got the power off, and we're making 10 kilometers an hour. Just falling down our own tracks.
145:08:50|T|CDR|Uh-oh.
145:08:59|T|LMP|Almost spun out.
145:09:03|T|CDR|How about this one right here, Charlie?
145:09:04|T|LMP|Yep, that's it, John. That's a good one.
145:09:13|T|LMP|Okay. It's Stop 5. We're supposed to park at -
145:09:16|C|Eng|180 .
145:09:18|T|LMP|180.  Say again, Tony.
145:09:23|C|Eng|Roger. I was just saying 180.
145:09:25|T|CDR|Say again.
145:09:38|T|CDR|It doesn't look like one to me either. Well -
145:09:41|T|LMP|It might be a primary impact, but I think those blocks - the rocks there - are from South Ray. I think we ought to get a rake sample here.
145:09:50|C|Eng|How big is that crater?
145:09:55|T|LMP|About 15 meters across.
145:09:58|C|Eng|Okay. Understand 15 meters.
145:10:03|T|LMP|That's affirm.
145:10:05|T|CDR|Okay. Well, we're parked right on the rim of it. We'll let you see.
145:10:08|C|Eng|Okay.
145:10:11|T|LMP|The biggest blocks we see, Tony, are about 50 centimeters, or bigger. And they're in the bottom and all over the crater no preferred orientation. Okay. We're parked at 174, 353, 5.9, 3.5, 100, 100 - Okay. Excuse me, John. 65, 65, 100 -  90, 105; off-scale low, and off-scale low.  Wow!
145:10:58|T|CDR|In a hole?
145:11:01|T|LMP|Well, it's downslope for me over here.
145:11:03|T|CDR|It is?
145:11:23|T|LMP|Well, I'm out. I'm not getting out again, and getting back in.
145:11:26|T|CDR|No, I don't mean that. I mean let's bring the Rover back up here.
145:11:29|T|LMP|Oh, you want to pick it up, huh?
145:11:30|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:11:31|T|LMP|Okay.
145:11:36|T|CDR|Okay, now. We've got to swing it around.  There we go.
145:11:50|T|LMP|Okay.
145:11:51|T|CDR|That's more like it.
145:12:12|T|LMP|didn't run.
145:12:13|T|CDR|What'd you say? Didn't run?
145:12:16|T|LMP|No The camera didn't run. &quot;X&quot; is still there. The film looks good.
145:12:29|T|CDR|Okay.   Mode switch to 2.
145:12:55|T|LMP|Okay; now it 's working.
145:13:16|C|Eng|Okay. We've got a picture.
145:13:23|T|CDR|Got the Earth in the tube. Okay.
145:13:27|C|Eng|Okay. And while you're brushing -
145:13:29|T|CDR|Brush the LCRU.
145:13:29|C|Eng|- off the LCRU there, make sure you do a good job. We notice it seems to be heating up.
145:13:38|T|CDR|I've <i>been</i> doing a good job, Houston. Honest.
145:13:40|C|Eng|Okay. We understand.
145:13:44|T|LMP|I'll vouch for that, Tony; honest.
145:13:47|C|Eng|We believe you!  Our best bet here at this crater is to look for -
145:13:55|C|Eng|- a rounded, as well as angular. The angular boulders are probably from South Ray. And maybe the rounded ones are working their way out of the regolith here. So that may be a cue to our getting Descartes.
145:14:10|T|LMP|Good point.
145:14:12|T|CDR|Roger.  Well, I'll tell you what. If we do a rake sample in the wall, would probably be our best bet.
145:14:27|C|Eng|Okay. Let's try that.
145:14:33|T|LMP|You know, John, looking back, I can't even see our tracks.
145:14:37|T|CDR|They're back there, I guarantee.
145:14:39|T|LMP|I know it. Man, we come a long way! I thought this thing was just right next door to us .
145:15:07|T|LMP|That rake is sure a great way to get a lot of rocks - in a hurry.
145:15:14|T|CDR|Yep, sure is.  Boy, I tell you, even <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16_lpi_trvrsmap.gif" title="image" target="alsj">South Ray</a> looks like it's accessible. I'd hesitate to say, though. There may be blocks down there that won't quit.
145:15:27|T|LMP|There's some big black ones. See those big black blocks there, John? -
145:15:30|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:15:31|T|LMP|- On the side of it. And there's some big white ones there, too. The black ones are the biggest.
145:15:37|T|CDR|It almost looks like we could just go right down there and right up on South Ray, doesn't it?
145:15:41|T|LMP|No, we couldn't.  I don't believe they're going to let us, but it looks it. I agree with you.
145:15:46|T|CDR|I don't think we could.
145:15:49|C|Eng|Judging by the blocks here, I sure don't know.
145:15:54|T|LMP|Aw, Tony, they aren't bad here. This Rover takes them like -  I don't think we're going to need 40 minutes here, I'll tell you. We ought to spend some more time somewhere else.
145:16:13|T|CDR|Let me get the rake sample, Charlie.
145:16:16|T|LMP|Okay. f/11 and 11 .
145:16:21|T|LMP|We could go out to - Okay, go ahead, pick a place. I'll get the gnomon. You going to get it? Okay.
145:16:39|T|LMP|Okay. Our little note here in the checklist , Tony, doesn't mean too much. We seem to be on a bench here that's about 50 meters wide, and the slope here on the bench is only about 2 degrees - maybe 3 or 4 degrees - maybe 10. No, about 5 degrees, I'd say. And -
145:17:02|T|CDR|Houston, here's about a foot-and-a-half across secondary -  looks like a primary - that cut into the upper rim of this 10- or 20-meter - yeah - this 20-meter secondary. How about sampling out of the wall of that one?
145:17:27|T|LMP|John, I don't think this big crater is a secondary.
145:17:31|T|CDR|That's what I mean. But this -
145:17:33|T|LMP|That little one is.
145:17:34|T|CDR|This little bitty one is probably a primary, too, because look at the glass on the bottom. Man, you've got to have velocity to do that.
145:17:42|T|LMP|Yeah, I agree.
145:17:43|C|Eng|Okay, does it look like it knocked out any rocks?
145:17:44|T|CDR|wall of this one, Charlie. Okay.
145:17:49|T|LMP|Okay.  Yeah, there is -
145:17:50|T|CDR|Yeah. I don't think the rocks that are there were there because -
145:17:55|T|LMP|Yeah, it does, John. There's some rocks right in that corner there, right by your footprint.
145:18:03|T|LMP|See that one right there? Right by the rake?
145:18:04|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:18:16|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds like a good plan.
145:18:22|C|Eng|And we'd like a documented sample of a glass-covered rock, if you can find one.
145:18:30|T|CDR|Okay. Well, we've got several. We've already picked up a couple of beads for you, but we didn't document them.
145:18:55|T|LMP|Now, that's a good bagful.
145:18:56|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:18:57|T|LMP|One scoop.
145:19:00|T|CDR|Want me to do it again?
145:19:02|T|LMP|Well, we got a bagful.
145:19:03|T|CDR|Notice the color of the material, Charlie, in the bottom of it. It's white.  We get a kilo of soil.
145:19:11|T|LMP|That's what this is. This isn't rocks.
145:19:14|T|CDR|Friable soil?
145:19:15|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:19:16|T|CDR|That could be Descartes, Charlie.
145:19:19|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, that rake sample was in 332, and I just - with an experiment - pinched one of the rocks, and it all - It broke.
145:19:33|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
145:19:34|T|LMP|It's probably going to be a bagful of soil when we get it back .
145:19:38|C|Eng|Well, that may still be Descartes.
145:19:44|T|CDR|It may be.
145:19:46|T|LMP|I think it is.
145:19:47|T|CDR|The lower material in the crater is -
145:20:08|T|CDR|Want another one?
145:20:10|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:20:22|C|Eng|Okay.
145:20:24|T|LMP|That's good, John. It's about a kilo.
145:20:25|T|CDR|It's somewhere between the gray of the surface and the white material that we picked up out on the plains. And we got a bagful of most of that from scooping underneath the rock sample.
145:20:40|C|Eng|Okay. And, after this, we'd like you to move to the rim of the main crater, and spend some time just describing the rocks you see, and then sample the rim.
145:21:01|T|LMP|Where?
145:21:02|T|CDR|Right there.
145:21:10|T|LMP|I don't see it.
145:21:11|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like a documented glass sample, if you have a chance.
145:21:17|T|CDR|That wasn't big enough to document.
145:21:19|C|Eng|Okay.
145:21:20|T|LMP|Okay; we'll look for a rock that's glass-coated, Tony.
145:21:22|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
145:21:27|T|CDR|If we were to sample on the upslope side of this crater where it's shielded - I mean, shielded toward South Ray - in the wall - If it wasn't caused by South Ray, then we ought to be looking at the real Descartes.
145:21:51|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds like a good idea.
145:21:52|T|LMP|That's a good plan.
145:22:02|T|LMP|Okay, Tony - Here's a glass-covered one, John, right here.
145:22:08|T|CDR|Okay.
145:22:09|T|LMP|Remember that right by this - Right by that footprint.  Right where I stopped walking.
145:22:17|T|LMP|Man, you're going to get me down in that crater.
145:22:20|T|LMP|I'm not going to get a down-Sun of that.
145:22:23|T|CDR|I don't think you ought to.
145:22:24|C|Eng|No, let's forget the down-Sun.
145:22:25|T|LMP|I'll get the cross-Sun, okay?
145:22:27|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:22:31|T|CDR|Now, the only rocks we see are really angular, and they're on this rim. And I guess the problem is it was a cratering event was probably so long ago. There's just not even a hint of any ledges or bedrock in this rascal.
145:22:56|T|LMP|John, why don't you take the rake right here in front of the gnomon. I've already documented that area. And see what you get?
145:23:04|T|CDR|Take the rake what, Charlie?
145:23:06|T|LMP|And just right here in front the gnomon and see what you get. One scoop and it might be -
145:23:12|T|CDR|Okay.
145:23:16|T|CDR|You do, huh?
145:23:17|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:23:18|T|CDR|Okay.  I don't think you're going to get anything but soil.
145:23:29|T|LMP|I don't , too.
145:23:31|T|LMP|No, there's some rocks. Two.
145:23:35|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:23:51|T|LMP|Okay, there we go. Why don't you hold the bag and let me pour it in? Okay.
145:23:58|T|CDR|Okay.
145:23:59|T|LMP|I bet we'd be in a better position.  -
145:24:13|T|LMP|Well, we've got a few of those. Let me try one more scoopful.
145:24:17|C|Eng|Okay; do those look like clods, too?
145:24:23|T|CDR|No, they don't. There's at least one of them that's glass-coated.  Hey, there's some.  These are whitish-type rocks, very small. They may have come from South Ray.
145:24:49|T|LMP|Let's try one more scoop, John.
145:24:51|T|CDR|Okay.
145:24:52|T|LMP|There's one right under there. It looks like a good bet.  Man, you can get a bunch of stuff with this rake.
145:25:08|T|CDR|See, if this was from South Ray -
145:25:10|T|LMP|Hey, look at that! And all of those are rounded.
145:25:14|T|CDR|I know - Charlie points - The different characteristics of these rocks that we're just getting right now, and maybe that's the key - is that they're all more rounded than the South Ray crater rocks are.
145:25:30|T|LMP|
145:25:31|T|CDR|There are a few angular in there, but these are mostly rounded; and I see some little black glass on one. But they're mostly rounded, whitish rocks covered with dust, of course.
145:25:42|T|LMP|Here's a couple of good ones.
145:25:48|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds real good.
145:25:49|T|LMP|Bag 334.
145:25:50|T|CDR|Okay.
145:25:54|T|LMP|That's bag 334, Tony.
145:26:01|T|CDR|Houston, do you want us to go sample the rim of this thing some more?
145:26:06|T|LMP|They want us to get a glass-coated one, and there's a good one right up on the -
145:26:08|T|CDR|Okay.
145:26:09|C|Eng|Okay, did you get -
145:26:10|T|CDR|Let's go up there and get it.
145:26:11|T|LMP|Okay.
145:26:12|C|Eng|Did you get your soil there?
145:26:15|T|LMP|Do what? Huh? Say again.
145:26:18|C|Eng|Okay. You got your soil there?
145:26:22|T|LMP|No. We didn't. I'll get a scoopful.
145:26:25|C|Eng|Okay. And you're doing so well -
145:26:27|T|LMP|
145:26:27|C|Eng|- inside the rim there, we'd kind of like you to stay inside the rim and just kind of work around and see what you can find.
145:26:35|T|LMP|Okay. Let me get us some soil here.
145:26:51|T|CDR|Wait a minute, Charlie.
145:26:53|T|LMP|This ain't - You really feel like you're on the verge of instability, don't you?
145:26:59|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:27:02|C|Eng|That's probably only because you are.
145:27:04|T|LMP|I got your the gloves so dirty.  There's a 100 kilos.
145:27:13|T|CDR|Okay. That's 100 kilos that's going into bag 402.
145:27:15|C|Eng|Okay; bag 402.
145:27:16|T|CDR|Hope you're able to document it with the TV, because we've stepped all over it.
145:27:22|T|LMP|Tony, these &quot;after&quot; pictures are going to be - On this kind of terrain, you're bouncing so much trying to keep your balance, that you just sort of obliterate whatever you've picked up - The place you picked it up.
145:27:39|T|CDR|Okay. We'll go around about a -
145:27:41|C|Eng|- any of that white soil. Is that right?
145:27:43|T|CDR|That's correct; we're not. I kicked some of it away to see just how -
145:27:49|T|LMP|Hey, John?
145:27:50|T|CDR|Yeah?
145:27:51|T|LMP|Here's an old, old rounded rock that's fractured, badly beat up. Let's get that one. Can you give me your -
145:28:01|C|Eng|That's what we're looking for, Charlie.
145:28:03|T|CDR|What, Charlie?
145:28:04|T|LMP|I was going to say take a picture of that.
145:28:12|T|LMP|This gnomon is worthless . It's against the stops.
145:28:17|T|CDR|That one right there?
145:28:18|T|LMP|Yeah. That one right there.
145:28:23|T|LMP|That's all we're going to be able to get.
145:28:26|T|CDR|Well, it's sort of an up-Sun .
145:28:29|T|LMP|Man, I'm feel like I'm -
145:28:33|T|CDR|I'll shoot these at 5.6, Houston. Stereopair up-Sun. I can get the &quot;location&quot; all right.
145:28:40|T|LMP|Oh, don't work at that, John.
145:28:42|C|Eng|Okay. We can get the location off the TV.
145:28:44|T|CDR|It's not worth it.  Okay.
145:28:52|T|CDR|was an old rock, wasn't it?
145:28:54|T|LMP|It was; it crumbled to pieces.
145:29:05|T|CDR|Get that right there.
145:29:07|T|LMP|I am. I'm trying to get upslope on it.
145:29:10|T|CDR|Here, let me. Hand me the rake, I can get it.
145:29:14|T|CDR|Careful, Charlie.
145:29:16|T|LMP|There we go.
145:29:28|T|LMP|Uh-oh. Okay. I got it.
145:29:32|C|Eng|Okay, and the white rock that you picked up -
145:29:34|T|LMP|Okay, that's got -
145:29:34|C|Eng|- and the ones you just have here, can you see any crystals in it?
145:29:40|T|LMP|Yes, sir. I sure can. It's a bluish crystal, a couple of millimeters size.
145:29:49|T|CDR|Bluish?
145:29:51|T|LMP|Well, that's what it looked - Grayish maybe. And one corner of it's got a glass rind on it about half a centimeter thick.
145:30:08|T|LMP|It looks like - It doesn't look like a breccia, Tony. It looks like a crystalline rock.
145:30:12|C|Eng|Outstanding.
145:30:13|T|CDR|Yeah, it's got a lot of - It's fine grained. It seems to be a fine-grained crystalline rock anyway, the part that we can see. The particles in it are millimeter size, though. I see some millimeter-size sparklies flashing at me.
145:30:30|T|CDR|That's going in bag 403.
145:30:33|C|Eng|Okay, 403.
145:30:34|T|LMP|Hey, John, why don't just - Let's keep that - I'm having about a strike out on this rake here. I get a couple of little ones each time, but -
145:30:43|T|CDR|Okay
145:30:44|T|LMP|- that's about it.  Want to move on around there about 10 feet or so?
145:30:50|T|CDR|Okay.
145:30:51|T|LMP|Pick a spot. I'll follow in your tracks. You're sliding downhill about 2 inches every time you - I can't get going, here.
145:31:09|T|LMP|Look at that glass-covered one right there, John.
145:31:12|T|CDR|Okay. Let's get it, Charlie.
145:31:14|T|LMP|Okay.  I'll back off and get the cross-Sun here.
145:31:26|T|CDR|Yeah, I'll have to get an up-Sun here, or else do a lot of work.
145:31:34|T|LMP|Gonna be just one rock and one bag here.
145:31:52|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We just picked you up a glass-rind rock. At least a quarter of it's got glass on it, and it's so - It's so  dust covered that it -
145:32:09|T|CDR|Defies description.
145:32:10|T|LMP|Defies description.  Yeah.
145:32:12|T|CDR|404 is the bag number -
145:32:17|C|Eng|Okay, bag 404.
145:32:19|T|LMP|Y'all got us on the big eye?
145:32:21|C|Eng|We sure do.
145:32:24|T|LMP|Yeah. They do.
145:32:25|T|CDR|close the top, Charlie.
145:32:30|T|LMP|Okay. Let me try a rake here. Let me get an &quot;after&quot;.
145:32:32|T|CDR|Get an &quot;after&quot;, Charlie.
145:32:33|T|LMP|Okay.  Got it.
145:32:39|T|LMP|Here, let me rake up here. Here's some. These are either clods or -
145:32:49|T|CDR|Be careful, Charlie.
145:32:56|T|LMP|Don't fall.
145:33:00|T|LMP|That was a whitish rock. That one probably came from South Ray.  Wait a minute.
145:33:07|T|LMP|Here's some good ones.  Dusty ones.
145:33:24|C|Eng|Man. It sure looks like a good thing we had that rake along.
145:33:26|T|CDR|Yeah, most of those are either little rocks -
145:33:30|C|Eng|Go ahead, John.
145:33:33|T|CDR|Well, I don't - There's a round one, Charlie.
145:33:37|T|CDR|I don't think this is going to be a simple problem , even after you -
145:33:45|C|Eng|We concur, John.
145:33:46|T|CDR|- you -
145:33:47|C|Eng|We sure do.
145:33:48|T|CDR|- get the rocks back because they're so darn - It's 405.
145:33:53|C|Eng|Okay.
145:33:54|T|CDR|Going in bag 405. That's a big round rock that's dust covered. I see white streaks through it, and I can't tell from the clasts showing through that I can see whether it - No, I don't know whether I can see any glass on it or not. But it's a friable white rock, and it's rounded.
145:34:16|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
145:34:17|T|CDR|Going into bag 405 with Charlie's rake sample.
145:34:22|C|Eng|Okay.
145:34:24|T|CDR|You see because there is so doggone many craters around here, I mean -
145:34:29|C|Eng|Right. Understand. We'd like you to find the steepest slope that you can work on there, and dig as deep as you can with that rake.
145:34:38|T|CDR|Let me do that, Charlie.
145:34:40|T|LMP|We're on it right now, babe. I'll tell you.
145:34:42|C|Eng|Okay, can you dig into the face of the slope a bit?
145:34:45|T|CDR|Let me dig. Let me - Charlie?! Let me do that.
145:34:49|T|LMP|Okay. I'll swap with you.
145:34:53|T|CDR|Hold the gnomon.
145:34:54|T|LMP|Okay -
145:34:58|T|CDR|Watch it now.
145:35:00|T|LMP|Hey, how about right up here, John. Here's a steep part, or right over there where we walked from.
145:35:05|T|LMP|Where you going?
145:35:07|T|CDR|Find a steep slope.
145:35:08|T|LMP|Okay, right to your left is a good one. Right where we been.
145:35:15|T|CDR|Steepest is closest to the rim.
145:35:18|T|LMP|That's right. Right up there.
145:35:26|T|LMP|Man, you don't make much headway.
145:35:48|T|LMP|That's a great job .
145:35:55|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. He's gone vertically into the wall, about a foot, and it all looks the same. Occasionally, you see a white splotch.
145:36:07|C|Eng|Okay. Will the rake pull out any rocks in there?
145:36:19|T|LMP|Just a minute.
145:36:21|T|LMP|Hey, John, I tell you what. Let me get upslope.
145:36:28|T|CDR|Move out of the shadow, Charlie. I can't see it.
145:36:31|T|LMP|Okay, there you go.
145:36:32|T|LMP|Whoop!   One thing about being on a 20-degree slope, you can get down on your knees.
145:37:05|T|CDR|Well, I think that's gonna be the name of the game until we get a -
145:37:17|T|LMP|Looks like just indurated regolith , doesn't it.
145:37:20|T|CDR|Uh-huh.
145:37:21|T|LMP|Don't see any rocks. Here let me do this.
145:37:35|T|CDR|There's one.
145:37:36|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:37:42|T|CDR|There's some.
145:37:44|T|LMP|Okay.  Yeah, they're rocks all right. Going in bag 335. Three little ones, Tony.
145:37:54|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
145:37:56|T|LMP|No, they aren't; they're clods. And they're clods, not rocks.
145:38:03|C|Eng|Okay.
145:38:05|T|LMP|But, anyway, 335. Did I say 331? 335.
145:38:10|C|Eng|You said 335.
145:38:11|T|LMP|John, let me have the rake a minute. Let me try something. Here you go.
145:38:16|C|Eng|Well, you think the rock concentration near the surface is a lag surface, then?
145:38:27|T|LMP|Apparently so because, in this wall here, we're not getting a thing.
145:38:32|C|Eng|Okay, why don't you take a soil right there -
145:38:34|T|LMP|And there looks like -
145:38:35|C|Eng|- fill up a soil bag.
145:38:37|T|LMP|Okay. And there's less soil here - I mean less rocks here than on the other side of the crater.  The side towards the Rover is -
145:38:56|T|CDR|This could be a South Ray - Of course, that's downslope too.
145:39:04|T|LMP|Now there are two rocks, right there.
145:39:08|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, I got to put this one in your bag before I can get it.
145:39:11|T|LMP|Okay.
145:39:15|C|Eng|And, we're going to have to press on after this sample.
145:39:20|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay.   20 minutes to get back to the Rover.  Oh, you need this, don't you? Yeah.
145:39:32|T|LMP|Get you a soil; they want a soil bag full. Hate to waste a bag on that one, but -
145:39:39|T|CDR|Okay. Let's put the soil in there with it -
145:39:41|T|LMP|Okay.
145:39:42|T|CDR|Bag 406 will have one rock in it and a soil sample from this low area .
145:39:50|C|Eng|Okay, sounds good.
145:39:55|T|LMP|Let's fill up the bag.
145:39:56|T|CDR|Okay.
145:39:59|T|LMP|And, Tony, a lot of this soil is coming out from about 6 inches down -
145:40:12|C|Eng|Okay.
145:40:13|T|LMP|- out of this crater.  You know, John, I think if we got a running start straight at the Rover , we'd make it up the other side.
145:40:20|C|Eng|Ah, let's go the other way.
145:40:22|T|CDR|Let's go around the rim.
145:40:23|T|LMP|Okay.
145:40:25|C|Eng|Okay, the plan back at the Rover is now we'd like John to take an <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">LPM</a> measurement and, Charlie, if you could sample around the rim there near the Rover; and take both angular and round, whatever you find.
145:40:38|T|LMP|Okay. Sure will.
145:40:41|T|CDR|really want - Okay.
145:40:46|C|Eng|Yep, we'd like an LPM.
145:40:49|C|Eng|Incidentally, your magnetic field there is about 130 gammas back at the LSM .
145:40:56|T|CDR|How is it at the site measurement. Does it agree with that?
145:40:58|C|Eng|Okay. I believe it was about 20 gammas less, something like that 110 gammas. It's -
145:41:02|T|LMP|
145:41:03|C|Eng|- plunging pretty steeply.
145:41:07|T|LMP|Hey, John. It's easier to go straight across. That was fun.
145:41:11|T|CDR|Well, I haven't had any trouble.
145:41:12|T|LMP|Okay.
145:41:13|T|LMP|I had a tough time walking up there, on the side like that.
145:41:16|T|CDR|I've got big feet today, Charlie.
145:41:18|T|LMP|Ah, so.
145:41:27|T|CDR|Of course, 45 feet on an LPM is gonna put me over the edge here. I'm gonna go out at right angles to the Rover, around this crater rim, for this measurement, Houston. It may not be exactly 45 feet, but it'll be close.
145:41:39|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds good, John.
145:41:41|C|Eng|And, Charlie, we'd like some fist-size samples here.
145:41:46|T|LMP|Okay, we've got a ton of them. We'll get them for you.
145:41:51|C|Eng|Good show.
145:41:56|T|CDR|Okay.
145:42:07|T|LMP|Lots of luck with that LPM.
145:42:11|C|Eng|And, John, why don't you take a pan when you document the location of that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">LPM tripod</a>. That'll take care of our pan.
145:42:20|T|CDR|That's a good idea. All right, fine. Good head.
145:42:23|T|LMP|I already took one pan.
145:42:24|T|CDR|Well, they want another one.
145:42:26|T|LMP|Okay.
145:42:28|T|CDR|Okay. The Read switch is going on.  Not the Read switch; the On switch. The power switch.
145:42:36|T|CDR|Mark.
145:42:37|C|Eng|Okay. We got it.
145:42:41|C|Eng|Charlie, where did you take your pan from?
145:42:50|T|LMP|Hmmm. On the south rim of that crater.
145:42:55|C|Eng|Okay.
145:42:56|T|LMP|About 10 feet to the 4 o'clock position of the Rover.
145:43:01|C|Eng|Okay, John. I guess we won't need a pan, if you can just get the LPM .
145:43:09|T|CDR|All right.
145:43:31|C|Eng|Okay, John. A minute .
145:43:35|T|CDR|Wait a minute; I'm deploying it.
145:43:38|C|Eng|Oh, I thought you gave a Mark. All right. I understand.
145:43:39|T|CDR|Turned it -
145:43:40|C|Eng|I understand.
145:43:43|T|CDR|Yeah, I did. For turning on.
145:44:05|T|CDR|Okay, I got it out to the white line now.
145:44:10|C|Eng|Okay.
145:44:35|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm sampling right in front of the Rover. About 10 feet. I got a fist-size rock out here.
145:44:41|C|Eng|Okay.
145:44:48|T|LMP|It's captured in the old tongs.
145:44:54|T|LMP|Was captured in the old tongs.
145:44:57|T|CDR|Okay, that 's aligned perfectly.  Phew. Here we go .  Okay. Now start your minute, Tony!
145:45:12|C|Eng|Okay. Will do.
145:45:53|C|Eng|Okay.
145:45:57|T|LMP|Hey, John. Could you throw me the bag that's under your seat.  I'll get it. I'll get it.
145:46:07|T|LMP|I thought so. The one that we were -
145:46:09|C|Eng|Okay, John, Mark.
145:46:12|T|LMP|No, it's not there; it's under my seat. Excuse me.
145:46:15|T|CDR|Okay.
145:46:26|T|CDR|Okay. The Read switch is going on. 563, 415, 3 - Wait a minute. 563, 415, 356. 570, 424, 357. 571, 425, 357. Off. Okay. The Power switch is coming Off.
145:46:58|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
145:47:01|T|LMP|Did you get those , Tony?
145:47:02|C|Eng|We sure did.
145:47:04|T|CDR|Did you get those? I forgot to ask you.  Okay.
145:47:07|C|Eng|And visors down.
145:47:08|T|CDR|Stow the moose.  Visor's down.  Hey, Charlie, where I tripped over here is a lot of white rock.
145:47:21|T|LMP|I got some over here, too.
145:47:26|T|CDR|Boy, I'm going to grab that one. That's a fresh, sharp, white rock, Houston, that I have never seen the like of. Very angular.
145:47:51|T|CDR|Ouch. Boy, Charlie, look at this rock! That has got to be plage.
145:48:04|T|LMP|Whereabouts did you find it, John?
145:48:05|T|CDR|Right down there in that hole -
145:48:07|T|LMP|Oh, yeah.
145:48:08|T|CDR|- with all that white rock -
145:48:09|T|LMP|Uh-huh.
145:48:10|T|CDR|Look at these little crystals in it.  No, that couldn't be.  A big, white, angular rock and it's - But all the crystals in it are very small. That is a crystalline rock. We're gonna get that one. That's the first one I've seen here that I really believe is a crystalline rock, Houston.
145:48:39|T|LMP|Want to put it in a padded bag?
145:48:41|C|Eng|Outstanding -
145:48:42|T|CDR|I believe we'd have to break it in two.
145:48:43|T|LMP|Oh.
145:48:43|C|Eng|No, we don't need that in a padded bag.
145:48:54|T|CDR|It's about 6 centimeters - 12 centimeters long, and it's got a head on it like - It looks like the head of, maybe, a viper or diamondback , if you lay it down flat. You won't have any trouble recognizing it. And it's white, and when I hold it up to the Sun, it has a greenish cast to it. A greenish-bluish cast.
145:49:24|C|Eng|Okay.
145:49:26|T|CDR|Oh shoot! I see some striations in it, too. They may be my imagination.
145:49:41|C|Eng|Okay, 337. And we're gonna have to press on here .
145:49:47|T|CDR|Okay, I'm putting this rock under your seat.
145:49:51|T|LMP|I'm in - Okay, John.
145:50:08|T|LMP|Gummit. I would do that.
145:50:31|T|CDR|I don't blame that pitch meter for falling down.
145:50:34|T|LMP|Man, I've fallen down twice. Not badly. The Rover wheels are covered with dust, John.
145:50:46|C|Eng|And, John, do you have a bag number for your white rock, or have you collected it yet?
145:50:52|T|CDR|I made a grab sample out of it, Houston.
145:50:54|C|Eng|Okay.
145:50:58|T|LMP|Too big for a bag, wasn't it, John?
145:51:00|T|CDR|Yeah, it was too big for a bag.
145:51:01|C|Eng|Okay.
145:51:03|T|CDR|It's -
145:51:04|T|LMP|You dog, you!
145:51:12|T|CDR|Amazing how you can be going along and trip over a rock and -  I'm one of these guys that always looks down and still seem to be able to trip them going forward.
145:52:20|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The samples are complete here. I'm leaving with frame count number -  Looks like about 170, Tony. I'd better change mags before we start out here. Over.
145:52:43|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds good.  Okay. And, while you're up there, you might adjust the DAC. Maybe you can get it running.
145:52:55|T|LMP|I already did; and it'll be running .
145:52:57|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
145:53:04|T|LMP|John?
145:53:05|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
145:53:06|T|LMP|That is the best sample we got.
145:53:07|T|CDR|I know it.
145:53:10|T|LMP|I'll tell you. That is a crystalline rock if I've ever seen a crystalline rock.
145:53:14|T|CDR|First one today!
145:53:16|T|LMP|Yeah.
145:53:17|T|CDR|At least the first one you could say was one, maybe.
145:53:19|T|LMP|That is a great rock.
145:53:25|T|LMP|Okay, John, when you get around there , could you give me a film mag? Black and white?
145:53:30|T|CDR|Okay.
145:53:31|C|Eng|I guess we could -
145:53:31|T|LMP|Which one do you want me to use, Tony?
145:53:32|C|Eng|Call that one the &quot;Great Young.&quot;
145:53:37|T|CDR|Oh, come on.
145:53:40|T|LMP|It's not very big, but it's just a nice rock.
145:53:44|C|Eng|Okay.
145:53:46|T|CDR|Yeah, it was made about - It looks like it's about 3 days old though it must be on the order of 4 billion.
145:53:57|T|CDR|Which one do you want, Charlie?
145:53:59|T|LMP|Any black and white. It doesn't matter. Wrong pocket.
145:54:06|T|CDR|Any black and white?
145:54:07|T|LMP|Yeah, ain't but one -
145:54:08|T|CDR|Okay.
145:54:09|T|LMP|- magazine I.
145:54:10|C|Eng|Okay.
145:54:11|T|CDR|You already shot up a roll of black and white?
145:54:12|T|LMP|Yeah. 170. Okay.  Uh-oh. I got it.
145:54:24|T|LMP|There you go.
145:54:27|T|CDR|Okay. Dark slide is in the camera box .
145:54:35|T|LMP|Hope it runs; I got dust on it.
145:54:51|C|Eng|Okay, we can -
145:54:52|T|CDR|
145:54:53|C|Eng|- see it works.
145:54:55|T|LMP|Okay, Tony.  Yeah, magazine India .
145:54:59|C|Eng|Okay.
145:55:01|T|LMP|And starting with frame count number about 3. I guess I fired off a couple.
145:55:07|C|Eng|Okay.
145:55:24|T|CDR|Okay, we're ready to press here.
145:55:27|C|Eng|Okay, and just to make sure you didn't get any dust on that LCRU while you're working around there, we would like you to brush it off again. We're really heating up on that.
145:55:36|T|CDR|It's clean!
145:55:38|C|Eng|Okay.
145:55:40|T|LMP|It is clean.
145:55:43|T|CDR|Yeah, it's clean. Honest!
145:55:46|C|Eng|Okay. That's okay.
145:55:49|T|CDR|Want to shut it down for a while?
145:55:55|C|Eng|No. That's all right. And, Charlie, on your LRV readouts, we won't be needing Volts, so why don't we just leave that switch in Amps?
145:56:05|T|LMP|Okay.  Got it in Amps.
145:56:14|C|Eng|Okay.
145:56:16|T|CDR|Okay. It's dusted. Going downhill , it doesn't get near as much dust as it did coming up, for some reason.  Maybe that's because it was 4 kilometers one way and half of one the other . That's probably the reason.
145:56:37|T|LMP|I hope I can get back in this beauty here now.
145:56:42|T|CDR|You're in!
145:56:51|T|LMP|Okay.  Dadgummit.
145:56:53|C|Eng|Okay, we've got the -
145:56:55|T|CDR|Don't do anything with the -
145:56:57|C|Eng|up. The ALSEP site was 230 gamma down; and Spook was 180 down.
145:57:11|C|Eng|Hey, John. Do you have switch position 1?
145:57:16|T|CDR|No, I'm going to 1 right now.
145:57:20|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
145:57:21|T|CDR|- the TV.
145:57:24|C|Eng|We thought maybe you were getting on -
145:57:27|T|CDR|TV's on CCW .
145:57:28|C|Eng|Okay.
145:57:42|T|CDR|Oh, no. TV is CCW. Heading for 6.
145:57:49|C|Eng|That was a very interesting magnetometer reading.
145:57:50|T|CDR|Yeah. I didn't think I'd ever -  Well, give you a good alignment and read the numbers right, but other than that I -
145:58:07|C|Eng|And, John -
145:58:08|T|CDR|Okay. Station 6 -
145:58:09|C|Eng|- We'll need your frame count
145:58:10|T|LMP|- should be about -
145:58:17|T|CDR|You'll have to wait. Oh, no. I can see it. It's 96, Tony, 96.
145:58:19|C|Eng|Okay. Very good.
145:58:36|C|Eng|And, Charlie, DAC, On, as you start driving.
145:58:43|T|LMP|It's already On.
145:58:45|C|Eng|Okay. And Station 6 will be completely nominal.
145:58:46|T|LMP|Okay -
145:58:49|T|CDR|Ahhhh.
145:58:50|T|LMP|Okay. It says 360 at 2.9. Why don't we just make it 3.5 at 2.9.
145:59:01|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I want to follow my tracks down this thing.
145:59:03|T|LMP|That's fine.
145:59:08|T|CDR|Okay, we're riding at idle , and she's picking up speed.
145:59:12|C|Eng|Okay. And we would like Station 6 at the lowest terrace on Stone Mountain and a blocky crater, if possible.
145:59:27|T|CDR|Understand. The lowest terrace a blocky crater.
145:59:29|C|Eng|Rog.
145:59:32|T|CDR|Charlie, where do you think Stone Mountain takes off in the -
145:59:37|T|LMP|I can see a place down here. See that - Off to the left, John, by where your tracks came up there - .
145:59:43|T|CDR|Yeah.
145:59:44|T|LMP|- There's a pretty big crater, with some blocks around it. I think that might do.  Okay, Tony, where do you estimate one would be?
146:00:03|C|Eng|Okay. You'll be at -
146:00:04|T|LMP|Now, there's one right down there, John.  12 o'clock, there's one. About 200 meters.
146:00:11|T|CDR|Twelve o'clock, 200 meters?
146:00:12|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:00:14|C|Eng|Okay. You'll be in the neighborhood and range about 3.0 or a little bit greater.
146:00:25|T|LMP|Okay!
146:00:26|T|CDR|I'm just glad that we don't have that watch-the-Rover-go TV.  Because I don't think we'd be going.
146:00:41|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, look in that -
146:00:45|T|CDR|Where is it, Charlie?
146:00:46|T|LMP|Just to the left there, John. See those blocks over there in that crater.
146:00:50|T|CDR|Say where.
146:00:51|T|LMP|Okay, your 10 o'clock position.
146:00:54|T|CDR|That big block there?
146:00:55|T|LMP|No. Well, on over farther than that.
146:00:56|T|CDR|You want to take off and go that way now? I can't see nothing. I got my visor down.
146:01:05|T|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, now hook a left. No, not through this crater. Ha, ha.
146:01:10|T|CDR|Yeah.
146:01:13|T|LMP|Right on the other side of this crater.
146:01:14|T|CDR|Kind of expect trouble from backseat drivers.
146:01:16|C|Eng|Yeah, I've noticed that.
146:01:18|T|LMP|Well, that's only 3.3, John. Why don't we go down a little bit further.
146:01:24|T|CDR|This one right here?
146:02:13|C|Eng|Okay. The nominal Station 4 would be on a bearing of 356 .  But you're going to have to use -
146:02:21|T|LMP|Okay. That's pretty good.
146:02:22|C|Eng|- your own judgment.
146:02:30|T|LMP|We'll veer over that -  Okay.
146:02:32|T|CDR|356 at what, Charlie?
146:02:33|T|LMP|At &quot;2.9&quot; it says.
146:02:34|C|Eng|3.0.
146:02:39|T|LMP|3.0.
146:02:41|T|CDR|Okay.  Like driving a camel.
146:02:55|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:02:56|T|LMP|And, Tony, over on Smoky , it doesn't appear - I can see the lineations over there, but they're more widely spaced than on Stone here ; and mostly parallel to the Cayley .
146:03:33|T|LMP|Yeah, I see it.
146:03:34|T|CDR|Do you?
146:03:35|T|LMP|Yeah. Now if we drive along the bench, maybe we'll find a blocky crater.
146:03:51|T|CDR|Want to go right or left?
146:03:53|T|LMP|Left.  Because then Station 8's on over to the left.
146:04:05|T|CDR|Look at that block there, Charlie!
146:04:06|T|LMP|Where?
146:04:07|T|CDR|That big block right over there.
146:04:09|T|LMP|I know it. That's the one I described. It's a giant size.  Okay, Tony. We're at 3.0 at 355 . Driving west, along a bench, trying to find a blocky crater.
146:04:32|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds good.
146:04:43|T|LMP|Passing these big glass-splattered rocks that apparently came out of South Ray.  think every one of them did, frankly.  Hey, here's a crater here, John, that's about 10 meters , that fairly blocky rim, angular. Want to stop here? It's a secondary on this side.
146:05:21|T|LMP|Tony, it's a secondary . We're at 357 and 3.1, and we got a secondary that's fairly blocky rimmed. There's one up just a little upslope from us that might be better. Though there's not as many blocks on the rim. Same size crater.
146:05:44|C|Eng|Okay; we'd like the more blocky one.
146:05:51|T|LMP|Okay, I think it's a secondary.
146:05:53|C|Eng|Right, but it might -
146:05:54|T|LMP|Okay, you park a 180 here, John .
146:05:55|C|Eng|- have punched through.
146:05:59|T|CDR|Okay; but I can't park 180. If I park 180, we'll be downslope from it.
146:06:07|T|LMP|No, the crater's over to the left.
146:06:08|T|CDR|I know where the crater is.
146:06:10|T|LMP|Oh.  Why, don't you just park north? I can point that antenna north.
146:06:23|T|CDR|Okay.
146:06:24|T|LMP|You ought to get over here to the right a little bit so the TV won't be looking into the Sun. Okay, this is good; yeah.
146:06:37|T|CDR|Now I'll just swing around and point it north. How will that be? There.
146:06:45|T|LMP|That's great.  Good show!
146:07:01|T|CDR|Okay.
146:07:31|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that, and verify DAC off.
146:07:39|C|Eng|Okay. And we'll also need EMU checks here.
146:07:47|T|LMP|Okay, I don't have any flags; I can't see my quantity.  I've got about sixty-five percent. Sixty-five percent and my pressure's good, and I haven't changed my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">cooling</a>.
146:08:12|C|Eng|Okay.
146:08:13|T|LMP|Mmmm.
146:08:16|T|CDR|Okay. Now this is harder -
146:08:18|T|LMP|It is.
146:08:19|T|CDR|Boy, Charlie.
146:08:20|T|LMP|It is.
146:08:21|T|CDR|This is - hard - -
146:08:22|T|LMP|It's a lot harder.
146:08:23|T|CDR|Yeah, I didn't - We didn't sink near - Of course, we're not standing on the rim of a crater. But this is harder, because we're just sort of bouncing here.
146:08:31|T|LMP|Yeah, it's a lot more - Tony, the regolith character, as John said, has really changed.
146:08:41|T|CDR|Okay, let me get the -
146:08:44|T|LMP|When we walk, we don't bounce as much -  I mean, we don't sink in as much.
146:08:50|T|CDR|Go to 2.  Charlie?
146:09:05|C|Eng|Okay; we've got a picture.
146:09:13|T|CDR|Rog. And you hardly got any dust on you, but I'm going to do you a favor and dust you off.
146:09:20|C|Eng|All right.
146:09:31|T|CDR|What you doing there, Charlie?
146:09:33|T|LMP|what this rock's made out of. I'm trying to get a fresh surface.
146:09:38|T|CDR|I wouldn't do that. It's not worth doing.
146:10:00|C|Eng|Ah, thank you much there, John.
146:10:01|T|LMP|Man, that is some rock. That matrix there's pure white, John, with black phenocryst in it. It might be clast. It might be a breccia. And it's got some lath-like crystals in it.
146:10:29|T|CDR|Look at that!
146:10:31|T|LMP|That's the one I'm talking about. See, I just broke that open.
146:10:34|T|CDR|Yeah, that's a two-rock breccia. Let me get a bigger piece of it, Charlie.
146:10:37|T|LMP|Okay, I don't know. You can't whack it off.
146:10:40|T|CDR|Too hard to whack?
146:10:41|T|LMP|Yeah, I've whacked about five times, as hard as I could.
146:10:44|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, it has a white matrix with square clasts and elongate clasts in it.
146:10:50|C|Eng|Okay, sounds good.
146:10:51|T|CDR|That might be - And it's rounded, too.
146:10:57|C|Eng|Very good, and we understand it's a two-rock breccia.
146:10:59|T|LMP|Looks like some more of them right down here, John, that are -
146:11:03|T|CDR|That is correct.
146:11:05|T|LMP|- that are sample size.
146:11:08|T|CDR|Okay, let's get some of those.
146:11:15|T|CDR|Okay.
146:11:20|C|Eng|And, John, we'll need an EMU check.
146:11:26|T|CDR|Okay. I'm reading 3.85 and no flags.
146:11:43|T|CDR|Every time I read my oxygen gauge,  I get an earful of orange juice.
146:11:48|T|LMP|Yeah, mine, too.
146:11:53|T|CDR|Fifty-eight percent, and I'm <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">between Intermediate and Minimum cooling</a>.
146:12:03|C|Eng|Okay; we copy.
146:12:07|T|LMP|Okay, pan's complete, Tony.
146:12:09|C|Eng|Very good.
146:12:11|T|LMP|- break. Grab the gnomon, John, and we - How about a set of tongs and a shovel? That ought to be good.
146:12:18|T|CDR|Think that ought to work?
146:12:19|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:12:21|T|CDR|Okay, that'll probably save us some energy.
146:12:25|T|LMP|Yep; think we might need it. Guess what?
146:12:29|T|CDR|What?
146:12:30|T|LMP|Look at that. Where are the wheels?  See that?
146:12:35|T|CDR|Yeah.
146:12:36|T|LMP|That's the gnomon stick. See the legs?
146:12:38|T|CDR|Yeah.
146:12:39|T|LMP|They're still in the bag.
146:12:41|T|CDR|Houston, you got any recommendations there?
146:12:44|C|Eng|Yeah, I think you ought to just use your scoop or something for a gnomon.
146:12:53|T|CDR|See what happened?
146:12:55|C|Eng|No. We can't see it now -
146:12:56|T|LMP|Pulled it right out of there.
146:12:57|C|Eng|- but I understand exactly what you mean.
146:12:58|T|CDR|When you pull -
146:13:01|T|LMP|Okay, I got the wand, and the legs stayed in the bag. Okay, give me a shovel, John. We can use the scoop.
146:13:10|T|CDR|Okay; well, we can use the shovel if - Where do you want to go?
146:13:15|T|LMP|I don't care. Anywhere is fine. This looks like a - Here's a nice little cracked one right there.
146:13:20|T|CDR|Yup.
146:13:21|T|LMP|There's some angular and rounded rocks right there.
146:13:23|C|Eng|Just pick anything in the picture for scale -
146:13:24|T|CDR|
146:13:25|T|LMP|Okay. Super.
146:13:26|C|Eng|- All we'll lose is the vertical .
146:13:31|T|CDR|Okay
146:13:32|T|LMP|Okay. You can stick the tongs in there, John.
146:13:35|T|CDR|Good.
146:13:54|T|LMP|Okay, Tony; can you get a locator from the TV on this sample?
146:13:56|C|Eng|I sure can. We've got it now.
146:13:59|T|LMP|Just pan by it.  Okay; thank you.
146:14:29|T|CDR|Okay.<p>
146:14:30|T|LMP|Excuse me.
146:14:38|T|CDR|Okay, that's going in bag 407. It was some soil and some dirt, a rounded rock - Wait a minute, Charlie; let me get an &quot;after&quot; of that.
146:14:45|T|LMP|Okay.
146:14:51|T|CDR|Okay.
146:14:53|T|LMP|Let's grab this angular one next.
146:14:55|T|CDR|All right.
146:14:57|T|LMP|Okay?
146:14:58|T|CDR|Yep.
146:14:59|T|CDR|No, now - Wait - Charlie!
146:15:02|T|LMP|What?
146:15:03|T|CDR|Let me get it with the tongs.
146:15:06|T|LMP|Leaning on that shovel is easy.
146:15:14|T|LMP|Might be the same kind, John, that you picked up the way there.
146:15:21|T|CDR|Yeah.
146:15:23|T|LMP|That one won't get sacked there.
146:15:29|T|CDR|Maybe you can.
146:15:30|T|LMP|This is partially sacked. There we go. You got it!
146:15:33|T|CDR|Okay, that - Get the &quot;after&quot;. Got it.
146:15:41|T|CDR|408, Houston, is the bag number.
146:15:52|T|LMP|Okay, I'll swap you. Why don't you get a soil sample?
146:15:56|T|LM Crew|-
146:15:57|T|CDR|Okay; that's a good idea.
146:15:59|C|Eng|Okay, and you've got about 10 minutes left before we'll have to leave.
146:16:06|T|CDR|Okay.
146:16:07|T|LMP|Okay; maybe we could go to one more area. And so we won't salt it with - This is just one broken-up block here.
146:16:17|C|Eng|Good plan.
146:16:21|C|Eng|Hey, you fellows are always thinking.
146:16:35|C|Eng|Okay.
146:16:43|T|LMP|See anything down under there, John?
146:16:45|T|CDR|No. This is a second - This is rim of it. It's very soft. I didn't have any trouble digging down with the shovel.
146:16:57|T|CDR|Solid gray all the way down. I see no layering.
146:17:00|C|Eng|Okay.
146:17:01|T|LMP|Let me put this in your bag.
146:17:11|T|LMP|John, how about on the upper rim there? -
146:17:14|T|CDR|Look at -
146:17:15|T|LMP|This might have been a secondary.
146:17:17|T|CDR|What's that right over there, Charlie?
146:17:18|T|LMP|It's a really a unique white-looking something-or-other.
146:17:23|T|CDR|Yeah. Let's see what that is.
146:17:32|T|LMP|I think it's soil.
146:17:40|T|CDR|Well, you want to get some of it? It's unusual soil, if it is.
146:17:45|T|LMP|It might have been just a little - Yeah, it looks like a little teeny impact, doesn't it?  Hey, let's get a quick one and then go on up here and get some of these blocks on the upper rim.
146:18:02|T|CDR|Okay.
146:18:04|T|LMP|Okay, there's f/11 and - Okay. It's a down-Sun.
146:18:12|T|LMP|Run around and get a locator.
146:18:28|T|LMP|Got you a bag coming, John.
146:18:33|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, what we're picking up is a white - It looks like a little patch of indurated regolith, and it's whitish in color.
146:18:47|C|Eng|Okay; we copy.
146:18:51|T|LMP|Okay, let's get a little bit more of the white, John. That got most of it; it was just on the end of the scoop.
146:18:57|T|CDR|Okay.
146:19:00|T|LMP|There's a good - Oh, that's great.  This orange juice is - .
146:19:23|T|CDR|That got it?
146:19:24|T|LMP|Yeah, that's got it.  I'll get your &quot;after&quot;.
146:19:28|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, that soil sample's in 339, Tony.
146:19:33|C|Eng|Okay; 339.
146:19:37|T|CDR|And I'm through frame count 106, now.
146:19:41|C|Eng|Okay; 106.
146:19:46|T|LMP|Maybe we can get a chance to get up another sample.  -
146:19:53|C|Eng|Okay, you've got about time for just one more.
146:19:56|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay!
146:20:02|T|CDR|I been hankering for a piece off that rock.
146:20:05|T|LMP|Here's an old rounded one right here, John. With the white spots in it. I don't see - Here's a real angular one right over here. It's probably out of -
146:20:20|T|CDR|Let's get this rounded one, Charlie -
146:20:21|T|LMP|Okay.
146:20:22|T|CDR|- just on a hunch.
146:20:30|T|LMP|Down-Sun, here.  Got it.
146:20:41|T|LMP|Get a locator.
146:20:56|T|LMP|Okay.
146:21:08|T|LMP|-  Ah, good show.
146:21:12|T|CDR|In bag 409, Houston. And it's so dust-covered that I'm unable to describe it, although it's a white subrounded rock. And I can't distinguish any crystalline structure in it. It's going in bag 409.
146:21:29|C|Eng|Okay; and you've got 5 minutes here.
146:21:34|T|CDR|Charlie, put that one in mine. Yours is full, almost.
146:21:36|T|LMP|Okay. Yours is getting full, too. We got to change out bags.  Whoops!   My bag is full?
146:21:47|T|CDR|Almost.
146:21:48|T|LMP|Okay. There you go.
146:21:49|C|Eng|Yeah; you fellows have been really scooping them up there.
146:21:54|T|LMP|Hey, John?
146:21:55|T|CDR|Yeah.
146:22:06|T|LMP|All right, there's a good place to whack. Something to lean on.  Thank you.
146:22:15|T|CDR|Oh, that's hard. You got it!
146:22:16|C|Eng|Good show!
146:22:17|T|CDR|Charlie, beautiful.
146:22:18|C|Eng|Demolished it.
146:22:19|T|LMP|Hey, that's a great rock! Look at that!!  I'm sorry we didn't get it documented before, Tony, but that is a good sample. It's a - I think it's a crystalline rock. Just a minute -
146:22:32|C|Eng|Okay, let's go ahead and document it now. -
146:22:33|T|LMP|- let me look at it.
146:22:34|C|Eng|- We'll get the location of the one that's still in place . It didn't look like it moved.
146:22:44|T|LMP|Okay, I'll get a cross-Sun here. It's a grayish-bluish  rock, Tony, in the matrix with some white clast in it.
146:23:06|T|CDR|Oh, Ch - Let me get it with the -
146:23:11|T|LMP|Isn't any trouble, John.
146:23:22|T|LMP|Man, the matrix is so fine-grained, I can't tell, Tony; but it's definitely got a blue cast to it and there are inclusions of a whitish - It looked like plage to me.
146:23:34|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that. Sounds great - .
146:23:36|T|CDR|-
146:23:36|C|Eng|We're gonna have to move out.
146:23:42|T|LMP|Okay.
146:23:45|T|CDR|And, ah, needle-like, black crystals in it, too.
146:23:48|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:23:49|T|CDR|I see one in there that's a millimeter wide by 3 millimeters long, and some other needle-like crystals in it.
146:23:58|T|LMP|Here's another piece came off the same rock.
146:24:02|T|CDR|It has this white clast in it. It's got to be a breccia, Charlie.
146:24:07|T|LMP|Think so? Yeah. They don't really look like -
146:24:13|T|CDR|That's going in bag 41 - 410.
146:24:17|C|Eng|Okay; 410.
146:24:21|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, when you say 5 minutes, does that mean that we be on the Rover moving?
146:24:27|C|Eng|Okay, that's the rolling time. It's time to load up right now.
146:24:29|T|LMP|Well, good.  Okay. Yours is hooked, too, John.
146:24:38|T|LMP|Well, I don't know. Did you get it?
146:24:44|T|CDR|Our training bags never did hook.
146:24:47|T|LMP|I know it.  No, they -
146:24:50|T|LMP|Okay; I'll put this up.
146:24:52|T|CDR|Okay.
146:24:53|T|LMP|You go get the TV.
146:24:58|T|CDR|Boy, is this a neat way to travel!
146:25:00|T|LMP|Isn't it great? I like to skip along.
146:25:04|T|CDR|Not me, boy.
146:25:08|C|Eng|Ah, Charlie, you're pure grace.
146:25:09|T|CDR|Okay.   Skip.
146:25:19|T|LMP|Well, whatever you call it.
146:25:20|T|CDR|Okay.
146:25:33|C|Eng|You fooled them again.
146:25:34|T|CDR|Okay; we're going mode switch to 1.
146:25:36|C|Eng|Okay.
146:25:38|T|LMP|I knew it was gonna come in handy some day.
146:25:42|T|CDR|And the TV is going up to CCW .
146:25:46|T|LMP|Okay; and we've got the - Hey, is the DAC supposed to be on? Yes, the DAC on. Okay. Turning the DAC on.
146:25:57|C|Eng|Okay.
146:26:15|T|LMP|Oh, you rat!  Sorry, John. But my seatbelt fell off.
146:26:27|T|CDR|Fell off?
146:26:28|T|LMP|Well, it was on the floor.
146:26:41|T|LMP|What?   fell down again, John.
146:26:48|T|CDR|Yeah, I saw that.  Can you make it? You want me to get out and help you?
146:26:55|T|LMP|No, I'm getting it now that I'm next to the Rover. Agh. My backpack hit the seat and just vaulted me off. How does my camera lens look?
146:27:08|T|CDR|Dusty; we'll dust it at the next place.
146:27:10|T|LMP|Okay.
146:27:12|C|Eng|And, Charlie, we'll need a frame count.
146:27:14|T|LMP|I'm sorry it's taking me -  Oh, yeah.
146:27:19|T|CDR|Okay, mine is 111.
146:27:24|C|Eng|Okay, 111.
146:27:29|T|LMP|Fifty for me.
146:27:32|T|LMP|What?
146:27:33|C|Eng|Okay; 50.
146:27:34|T|CDR|Your back - We're gonna have to - You knocked off your whatchacallit, your -
146:27:38|T|LMP|Is that my bag?
146:27:39|T|CDR|Yeah, it - Wait a minute. It's not off, but it will be in a second. It's loose. Turn around and let me see. No, it's Velcroed on.
146:27:49|T|LMP|Okay; good.
146:27:52|T|CDR|That would be bad .
146:28:02|T|CDR|Okay.
146:28:03|T|LMP|About to come loose.  lose that.  Hey, Tony, we're delaying slightly. The Buddy SLSS bag was working loose.
146:28:21|C|Eng|Okay.
146:28:25|T|LMP|Okay, there it is.
146:28:40|T|CDR|Are you doing okay, Charlie?
146:28:42|T|LMP|Yeah; I'm doing fine.
146:28:43|T|CDR|Okay.
146:28:44|T|LMP|I just can't get my PLSS back in - There we go.
146:28:50|T|CDR|All set?
146:28:51|T|LMP|Just a minute.  Dadgum <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="alsj">seatbelt</a>. Well. Okay; there. I'm in, finally.
146:29:14|C|Eng|Okay, and we understand the DAC is on?
146:29:16|T|CDR|Okay; Primary .
146:29:21|C|Eng|Great.
146:29:22|T|LMP|And we bypass Station 7 and we go to 8. And that's -
146:29:25|C|Eng|All right we figure a heading of 274 and 0.8.
146:29:26|T|LMP|- 014 and 2.9 and they want a ray.  Okay, so that's distance, right?
146:29:35|C|Eng|That's right.
146:29:36|T|LMP|274. Okay, John, I make it six point - 7.5 on distance .
146:29:38|T|LMP|Look at that blue rock that we just whacked on!
146:29:53|C|Eng|And when you get there, you'll read 3.0 and 10 degrees .
146:30:02|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, we're going downslope - cross-slope, Tony. And I feel like I'm about to fall out.
146:30:14|T|LMP|We're still in the blocky field. In fact, it's just South Ray material, I think, that's all over the place.  Hey, John -
146:30:41|T|CDR|Glad you got a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="alsj">seatbelt</a> on, Charlie.
146:30:44|T|LMP|Me, too.
146:30:46|T|LMP|Okay, I can still see old Orion! We sure parked on a - You landed on the highest point around, John! Even down in that crater you can still see it.
146:30:59|C|Eng|Say, not bad for a Navy pilot.
146:31:03|T|LMP|No; he did a great job. Okay, we're back into a thicker part of the ray, Tony. The regolith is here covered with cobbles about 40 to 50 percent. You're gonna have to bear way left, John.  Okay, now, if we hold that range, like, tack in. Look at that piece of glass we just rolled over.  This 'll be great. 015, we've got to go.
146:31:39|C|Eng|Gee, we sure hope you don't get a flat tire there.
146:31:41|T|CDR|What do you want, 015?
146:31:44|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:31:46|T|CDR|Man, if you could see these rocks, you'd hope it.
146:32:00|T|CDR|Oh, boy.
146:32:01|T|LMP|We ran over that beauty.
146:32:02|T|CDR|Yeah, and I'm not so sure -
146:32:03|C|Eng|Right; and there should be a lot of boulders in here, and we'd like you to get a lot of the Hasselblad photos. And then when you go past the north side of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Stubby</a> there, swing your DAC around.
146:32:15|T|LMP|Okay, we're not going to be able to see Stubby. Tony. It's on the other side of a big ridge.
146:32:19|C|Eng|Okay.
146:32:24|T|LMP|The map was wrong. It's been mapped wrong. We're down in a little swale now, and there's about a 30-meter ridge off to our left about 300 meters; it blocks out Stubby. You want us to go up and travel along that ridge?
146:32:40|C|Eng|Well, depending on your trafficability.
146:32:46|T|LMP|Well, we could do it. I'd like to see back into Stubby.
146:32:57|C|Eng|Well, why don't you press on up there?
146:33:06|T|LMP|Want to, John?
146:33:07|T|CDR|Yeah, might as well. We've got to go by that big rock. Is that where we're going, to that big rock?
146:33:13|T|LMP|That'd be a great place to sample the ray. That's probably on the ray. But they want to go left, about 10 o'clock, up onto that top of that ridge.
146:33:21|T|CDR|Okay; will you be able to take pictures? ?
146:33:22|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:34:01|C|Eng|Okay; very good.
146:34:04|T|LMP|We're now at 005 at 3.0. And the contact I'm talking about is at 12 o'clock, probably a couple of hundred meters .
146:34:15|T|CDR|You know, I don't want to be discouraged about this sort of thing, but I feel like this may be a problem we're going to have to attack statistically out here. Because, boy, it is really difficult to tell, just looking at a rock; except for the roundness, it's difficult to tell what kind of a rock it is. Now there's a vesicular-looking rock right there.
146:34:41|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:34:42|T|CDR|That's the first rock I've seen with vesicles in it.
146:35:10|C|Eng|Okay; copy.
146:35:11|T|LMP|And we've still got a couple hundred meters to go up to the ridge. John, why don't you swing directly south and let's just go straight up that beauty, see what we see up there. Probably nothing but another ridge.
146:35:27|T|CDR|It's pretty steep, Charlie.
146:35:29|T|LMP|We're making six tenths - or six kilometers an hour .
146:35:40|T|CDR|That's really a steep ridge.
146:35:42|T|LMP|This is here?
146:35:43|T|CDR|Yeah.
146:35:44|T|LMP|Have you got full throttle on?
146:35:45|T|CDR|I got full throttle.
146:35:47|T|LMP|Boy, we're hardly moving.
146:35:50|C|Eng|Okay, you want to read some amps?
146:35:56|T|LMP|Yeah. We've got 55. 50.
146:36:00|T|CDR|Okay, what it is, is we've lost the rear-wheel drive.
146:36:05|C|Eng|Okay, understand.
146:36:06|T|CDR|Not reading any amps on the rear wheel.
146:36:11|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that.
146:36:21|T|CDR|And with that in mind, I'd just as soon not go up to this ridge, Charlie.
146:36:24|T|LMP|Me, too.  I agree.
146:36:27|C|Eng|Okay; we suggest you head on towards 8 and stay on fairly flat ground, and we'll work up a procedure.
146:36:40|T|LMP|John, why don't we check it? Can you turn the forward off and see if we move?  It just might be a steep slope. But the front wheels were really digging in.
146:37:03|T|CDR|No, Charlie. The ammeter was reading zero!
146:37:05|T|LMP|I know. Could be a broken meter.
146:37:14|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, at 007/3.1 - passing another secondary that's elongate in the direction of South Ray and it - Those are the big blocks they were talking about, John. Right over there, there are four or five of them.
146:37:41|C|Eng|And how fast are you making now, John?
146:37:43|T|LMP|The regolith is still -
146:37:47|T|CDR|Say again?
146:37:48|C|Eng|How fast are you doing?
146:37:50|T|CDR|What'd you say, Tony?
146:37:52|T|LMP|He wants to how fast we're going.
146:37:54|T|CDR|We're going at 7 clicks.
146:37:56|C|Eng|Okay.
146:38:15|T|CDR|Call that Station 8?
146:38:16|T|LMP|Call that Station 8. That's gonna be about it. We're about -  There's one that's overturnable, I'll bet you. Right there.  Look at that elongate one, that shred there. Whatever that is.
146:39:12|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we're at 00 - 010 at 3.0, and we've got about three or four 2- or 3-meter-size blocks, one black and some white ones. How does this stop sound?
146:39:27|C|Eng|Okay; this sounds pretty good.
146:39:32|T|LMP|Okay; 180, John, on the heading.  No, 270; they want a Nav update. You knew that.
146:39:41|T|CDR|That's right.
146:39:43|C|Eng|Okay, and we're looking primarily for blocks from South Ray. So if you feel like this is the ray, this sounds great.  And we don't need a Nav update, so 180 is great.
146:39:56|T|LMP|What do you think, John?
146:39:58|T|CDR|Oh, yeah.
146:40:16|T|CDR|Yep, Charlie.
146:40:19|T|LMP|Amazing.  Okay, Tony.  176, 011, 7.9, 2.9, 95, 95, 00, 100, 115, 110 make it. And I can't see the motor - Oh; off-scale low, forward and rear motors - or forward motors.  Off-scale low, rear ones.
146:41:05|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
146:41:07|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. What happened, we may have -
146:41:12|T|LMP|Excuse me, John. I'm sorry.
146:41:14|T|CDR|My - Okay. My best guess of what happened - of what may have happened, Houston, is that cut a wire or something on the back.
146:41:36|C|Eng|Cut a wire?
146:41:38|T|LMP|Okay, I've got -
146:41:41|T|CDR|Yeah, a wire going back there to that aft thing. On the way down here - the regolith and everything being what it is - when we were bouncing up in the air, we came down on at least two rocks that I know about.
146:41:57|C|Eng|Okay; we understand.
146:42:03|T|CDR|Well, it's a sort of dynamic situation that I don't think anybody was thinking about much.
146:42:22|T|Frank|Can he see those wires? I can't tell.
146:42:34|C|Eng|Okay.
146:42:36|T|CDR|Okay; Station 7.
146:42:40|T|CDR|
146:42:41|C|Eng|And verify the DAC's off.
146:42:46|T|LMP|I missed that. Stand by.
146:42:50|T|CDR|How's mine , Charlie?
146:42:53|T|LMP|Yours is great.
146:42:54|T|CDR|Getting it good.
146:42:54|T|CDR|Okay.
146:42:55|T|LMP|Go.
146:43:06|T|CDR|Okay, mode switch to 1.
146:43:08|T|LMP|Thanks for the reminder, Tony.
146:43:10|C|Eng|Okay.
146:43:11|T|LMP|Man, those battery covers are filthy.
146:43:17|C|Eng|We aim to please, too.
146:43:23|T|LMP|And the regolith here, is firmer than up on Stone. We're in a blocky field here. Predominant size is 10 to 15 centimeters, but the biggest one is a couple of meters. And you'll see that 12 o'clock from the Rover.
146:43:50|C|Eng|Wow! That's a real boulder.
146:44:11|T|LMP|Double core, here, is first thing. I think we're in the ray, so I'll just sample right out - Do it right over here.
146:44:42|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, you should have us now.
146:44:43|C|Eng|Okay; we sure do.
146:44:45|T|CDR|What're you doing, Charlie?  Charlie?
146:44:49|T|LMP|What?
146:44:50|T|CDR|What're you doing?
146:44:51|T|LMP|Stand by.  Tell you later.
146:45:08|T|CDR|Okay -
146:45:09|T|LMP|Okay, I need to get a double core tube.
146:45:14|C|Eng|Thank you, John.
146:45:17|T|LMP|Agh!  God.
146:45:24|T|CDR|Want to get it, Charlie?
146:45:26|T|LMP|Yeah, if I could ever get the top open on those things.
146:45:28|T|LMP|Okay, there we go. There's an upper and lower.  Closed again.
146:45:41|T|CDR|Okay.
146:45:43|T|LMP|What did he say? Didn't he call you for something, John?
146:45:46|T|CDR|What did you say, Tony?  Oh; he said, &quot;Thank you .&quot;
146:46:09|T|LMP|How do you read, Houston?
146:46:11|C|Eng|Oh, you sound good, Charlie.
146:46:16|T|LMP|Okay; thank you.
146:46:29|T|CDR|There's a boulder over here we can split.
146:46:32|T|LMP|Yeah.
146:46:34|T|CDR|You see it?
146:46:36|T|LMP|That one off to your right down there, I think we could turn that one over.
146:46:45|T|CDR|Yeah. I think you're right. I think we could turn that one over, Charlie.
146:46:48|T|LMP|How about samples of those two? That white one and that big one on the other side over there?
146:46:57|T|CDR|Okay.
146:46:58|T|LMP|Get a chance.
146:47:00|T|CDR|Can I help you with the double core?
146:47:01|T|LMP|No. Go ahead with what you got to do.
146:47:05|T|CDR|Okay, well I can get a rake soil here while you're doing that. Okay?
146:47:09|T|LMP|Okay, I'll have to - Okay, fine. I'll just have to take the scoop off . Can you do that rake/soil by yourself, you think?
146:47:17|T|CDR|Yeah.
146:47:19|T|LMP|Okay.
146:47:24|T|CDR|Think so.  Okay.  &quot;Rake/soil away from the boulders.&quot;
146:47:47|C|Eng|I'm just a little curious. How near are you to the edge of this ray?
146:47:56|T|LMP|goes in both directions as far as we can see.
146:47:58|T|CDR|That's right.
146:47:59|C|Eng|Okay. We can forget that one sample off the -
146:48:01|T|LMP|Tony, the whole area is just covered with these rocks.
146:48:13|C|Eng|Yeah. It sure looks that way.
146:48:14|T|LMP|Have you seen the rocks on the -  Okay, that's what they all are!
146:48:21|C|Eng|Okay; I guess we're just looking for a variety, then, in the boulder protocol.
146:48:28|T|LMP|Okay, we can give you that, I'll tell you. There's two big boulders at 12 o'clock that are going to be great sampling. One of them is a rounded; but the biggest - and it's black. And the other is white and it's very sharp, very angular.
146:48:54|C|Eng|Okay.
146:49:15|T|LMP|Okay, great.
146:49:17|T|LMP|Seven feet.  Eight.
146:49:41|T|LMP|Don't believe it.
146:49:50|T|LMP|Ummm.
146:49:58|T|CDR|What's the matter, Charlie?
146:50:01|T|LMP|Not going in too well!
146:50:05|T|CDR|Pretty hard around here.
146:50:11|T|LMP|Oh, rats.
146:50:15|C|Eng|That's all right. I do that all the time.  Usually, I have my thumb in the way.
146:50:32|T|LMP|Nope; cain't do it. I cain't get down that far.
146:50:51|T|LMP|Well, I'm going to have to go get the tongs -
146:50:53|C|Eng|Yeah, it looks like a good plan.
146:50:55|T|LMP|- to get the hammer. Tony, I don't think the doub -  Yeah. Tony, I don't think the double core is going to go in. Do you want me to pull it out and shake it out and try another place? I think I hit a rock -
146:51:06|C|Eng|Okay, yeah -
146:51:06|T|LMP|- 'Cause it stopped -
146:51:07|C|Eng|- we'd sure like you to do that.
146:51:08|T|LMP|- all at once.  Okay. That one just stopped all at once, so I think I did hit a rock.
146:51:17|C|Eng|Okay.
146:51:21|T|CDR|Okay, Houston -
146:51:26|C|Eng|And, John, on the LRV, do you know if you lost the rear steering as well as the drive?
146:51:36|T|CDR|No, because I'm unable to see behind me.
146:51:40|C|Eng|Okay.
146:51:41|T|LMP|We could give it a little test drive, John.
146:51:45|T|CDR|Yeah.  I wasn't getting hardly any amps out of the rear. I was getting some, so maybe that's an indication that I had rear steering.
146:52:00|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, out of five of -
146:52:01|C|Eng|- we had a couple of amp using zero .
146:52:05|T|CDR|Oh. Out of five scoops, I've got about, oh, 10 rock frags, a couple of which are - One of which has some interesting black glass along the sides of it, another of which is covered with black glass. And - But in the most, there's not much of that material around here. That's going into bag 411.
146:52:38|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 411.
146:52:39|T|CDR|Where you're away from boulders there's hardly anything but soil. Very few rocks, in other words.
146:52:49|C|Eng|Understand.
146:53:26|T|LMP|Agh! Oh, you dog!
146:53:35|T|LMP|Whew. Taking a break!
146:53:38|C|Eng|Good idea.
146:53:50|T|LMP|Man, there are little glass beads all over the place here, John.
146:54:46|T|LMP|Boy, it is hard under here, Tony.
146:54:48|C|Eng|Right, it sure looks it -
146:54:49|T|LMP|
146:54:49|C|Eng|- but I can see you're getting it down.
146:54:50|T|LMP|It's in.
146:54:57|C|Eng|Good show.
146:55:01|C|Eng|Oh, I think we'll take it, Charlie.
146:55:03|T|LMP|Okay. Boy, I hope that thing is full of gold, because that was a hard one. Whew!
146:55:24|T|LMP|I can't believe it! It comes out so easy.
146:55:39|T|LMP|Okay, the bottom one is 36, Tony.
146:55:37|C|Eng|Okay.
146:55:38|T|LMP|I've got my hand over the top number. I'll give it to you in a minute.
146:55:40|C|Eng|Okay.
146:55:41|T|CDR|Okay, the soil sample here, Houston, is going in bag 412.
146:55:46|C|Eng|Okay; 412.
146:56:23|C|Eng|Anything that stares at you, you'd better pick up.
146:56:24|T|CDR|It's a glass; but in this sunlight, it's reflecting red, green - Like a rainbow.
146:56:39|C|Eng|Very good.
146:56:46|T|LMP|found the first prism on the Moon, John.
146:56:48|T|CDR|It's something like that.
146:56:54|T|LMP|Whew, boy.
146:57:32|T|CDR|Charlie, guess who's out of bags.
146:57:34|T|LMP|Oh, the Commander.  Here, wait a minute. I'll come get you one.
146:58:01|T|CDR|I don't know if that thing will last or not. No, I guess it was just black glass but it was the way the Sun was reflecting off of it.  That's not too bad. Anyway, that's sampled and it's going in bag 413.
146:58:25|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, the bottom core, as I said, was 36 and the top part is 29. I think; wait a minute. 29.
146:58:39|C|Eng|Okay, we copy 29.
146:58:46|T|CDR|I didn't know you guys were watching. I wouldn't have done that.  Ha ha.
146:59:04|T|LMP|You know, I've found a use for every geology tool we've got back here.
146:59:37|T|CDR|I'm gonna drive over there , Charlie, so - Let me check out this -
146:59:43|T|LMP|Hey, that's a good idea, John.
146:59:45|T|CDR|- steering.
146:59:47|T|CDR|Houston -
146:59:48|T|LMP|Turn off the front drive power, too. I think you're right, because those front wheels were really digging in.
146:59:59|C|Eng|Okay.
147:00:05|T|CDR|How about if we just leave the TV on? Just drive over to where we're going to sample these boulders and test this thing out a little. Will that mess you up too bad ?
147:00:22|T|CDR|Or do you lose sync or something and never get it back.
147:00:32|T|LMP|I know there are some core tube caps in here somewhere, but -
147:00:38|T|CDR|Especially - We're just going to drive slow because we want to check this baby out.
147:00:46|T|LMP|You need some more bags, John?
147:00:48|T|CDR|Yep.
147:00:51|T|LMP|Okay, here's a setup on your seat.  There's the core tube caps!   just not answering.
147:01:09|T|CDR|Houston, how do you read? Over.
147:01:10|C|Eng|Oh, we're copying you 5 by. We understand that you're going to drive over to the other area.
147:01:20|T|CDR|We'd like to, and we'd like to run through a Rover steering test while we're doing it. What we're talking about doing - You see those boulders you're looking at. We're just talking about driving around this crater, about halfway around it, to do the steering test.
147:01:37|C|Eng|Okay, sounds good and we would like - After you've done that, we would like to go through a procedure of our own while you're on there.
147:01:48|T|CDR|All righty. You want to stay off and watch, Charlie?
147:01:52|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm going to watch.  Okay, Tony, did you get that, the double core, the top one was 29?
147:02:01|C|Eng|Yes, we copied that.
147:02:05|T|LMP|Okay.
147:02:07|T|CDR|Oh, boy!
147:02:09|T|LMP|I'll get it, John. Go ahead and get in.  - strap.
147:02:12|T|CDR|No, we've got it.
147:02:15|T|LMP|How about that one?
147:02:17|T|CDR|I wouldn't believe it if I - We may not get it out of there.
147:02:25|T|LMP|I wouldn't believe it if I saw it again. Here you go. Okay.  That little - finally came out of there.  Okay, you're all locked.
147:02:58|T|CDR|Okay.
147:03:02|T|LMP|Man, there's a lots of glass around here.
147:03:09|T|CDR|Okay, now what I'm going to do is -
147:03:14|T|LMP|Why don't you try - Excuse me.
147:03:16|T|CDR|I'm going to try the steering first, Charlie.
147:03:20|T|LMP|Okay. Why don't you just go to Primary, and let me check - Take a look at her.
147:03:25|T|CDR|Okay, Primary.
147:03:27|T|LMP|It's working.
147:03:29|T|CDR|Steering's working?
147:03:30|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:03:32|C|Eng|Okay, how are your amps?
147:03:33|T|LMP|Why don't you just try rear drive only.
147:03:38|T|CDR|Just sitting there doing nothing.
147:03:40|C|Eng|Okay.
147:03:41|T|CDR|Now - - max, Charlie.
147:03:47|T|LMP|It ain't going. You lost it.
147:03:49|T|CDR|Yeah. Now let's put them on Bus C.
147:03:53|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:03:54|T|CDR|How about that?
147:03:55|T|LMP|Okay.
147:03:56|C|Eng|Okay, how about the rear drive on the -
147:03:59|T|CDR|Okay -
147:04:00|C|Eng|- Bus A and B.
147:04:00|T|LMP|That's okay -
147:04:00|T|CDR|- we got it.
147:04:01|T|LMP|- you got it!
147:04:02|T|CDR|We got it, right? Okay, Houston, we got rear steering on Bus - Wait a minute; wait a minute; wait a minute. That's for -  Was that in Forward Drive Power? No, that's just with the Forward Drive Power. Okay, now I'll put the Left Rear on Bus B. Now let's see what we've got.
147:04:25|T|LMP|Nope.  - , John.
147:04:28|T|CDR|Nothin'.  Okay, we've tried the forward and rear steering on Bus B. We have rear steering. We have forward steering. We have Forward Drive Power, but we don't have any Rear Drive Power on either Bus . Let me try it in Secondary.
147:04:47|C|Eng|Okay, John, we'd like you to try the PWM 1 on the Left Rear and Right Rear.
147:04:54|T|CDR|You want me to go -  Okay, you want on - I'm in PWM 1 on Left Rear and Right Rear?
147:05:03|C|Eng|Right -
147:05:04|T|CDR|How about if - You want me to go to PWM 2 on the Front Rear? Say again.
147:05:07|C|Eng|Negative. We would like all the Drive Enables to PWM 1.
147:05:14|T|CDR|Okay, they're all on PWM 1; and do I have to be in PWM 1 Select 1, or Both.
147:05:21|C|Eng|Negative.
147:05:22|T|CDR|Oh, that's the problem!
147:05:25|T|LMP|That's the problem, you weren't in Both, huh?
147:05:27|T|CDR|That is the problem! Somehow this guarded switch got moved to - Oh, isn't that amazing.
147:05:37|T|LMP|Amazing.
147:05:38|T|CDR|Yeah.
147:05:39|T|LMP|Unbelievable.
147:05:40|C|Eng|Okay, great -
147:05:41|T|LMP|You're still in 1 - Okay.
147:05:43|T|CDR|I'm going to turn off the front drive power.
147:05:45|T|LMP|Okay, you're in 1.  There you go. That's it.
147:05:55|T|CDR|Okay, now, let's see if we got it.
147:05:59|T|LMP|Nope.
147:06:07|C|Eng|Okay -
147:06:08|T|LMP|I'll bet your Primary Power's off, John.
147:06:08|C|Eng|- we'd like to go back to nominal configuration.
147:06:12|T|CDR|That's what we're doing.
147:06:14|T|LMP|Okay, now try your rear motors. Okay, you've got it now.
147:06:20|T|CDR|The problem was, Houston, PWM Select was in 1.  That was the problem. Sorry about all that inconvenience.
147:06:44|T|LMP|Try that. I've haven't done that since we been up here.
147:06:48|T|CDR|Watch out, Charlie. I'm liable to run over you.
147:06:50|T|LMP|Yowee! Wait a minute; don't do that.
147:06:55|T|CDR|- gently.
147:07:01|C|Eng|John, after you went back to normal configuration, did you drive it?
147:07:08|T|CDR|Yes. That mess you up?
147:07:24|T|CDR|Houston?  I'll see where they are.
147:07:47|T|CDR|You still got a picture, huh?
147:07:50|C|Eng|Sure do. But I think we need the antenna touched up.
147:07:54|T|CDR|Well, that's what I asked if I could do if I drove slow.  All right, be glad to.
147:08:01|T|LMP|Tony, this is really some rock. It's a two-rock breccia, with the matrix being blue to me, in this light anyway ; and the white clasts are fragments of crystalline rocks that appear to be fairly coarse-grained. Take that back, let's say, fine-grained -
147:08:42|T|CDR|that the one you want to turn over, Charlie.
147:08:45|T|LMP|This thing! Gosh! I can't even budge it.
147:08:48|T|CDR|It's a biggie.
147:08:49|T|LMP|Hey! I did budge it!
147:08:51|T|CDR|Charlie wants to turn that one over, Houston.
147:08:53|T|LMP|I want to get a chip out of it.  Look at that rock over there, John. If that's not a crystalline rock, I'll -
147:08:59|T|CDR|Eat the whole thing, right?
147:09:00|T|LMP|- depressurize right here. Yeah, the whole thing.
147:09:05|C|Eng|I wouldn't bet on that, Charlie.
147:09:07|T|CDR|you get a flightline stereo of it?
147:09:08|T|LMP|Yeah, but I didn't get a close-up. I don't think we can turn that one over, John.  I can move it. And I can rock it.
147:09:17|T|CDR|Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's go over here and look. Let's not put no effort into it. I believe we can - I believe we can push it this way.
147:09:27|T|LMP|Well, let's get a chunk off of it before we -
147:09:29|T|CDR|Okay?
147:09:30|T|LMP|- push it.
147:09:32|T|CDR|No, I don't think so either.
147:09:34|T|LMP|There's a better one to turn over right down there. It's about half this size.
147:09:37|T|CDR|Yeah. Yeah, it'll work good.
147:09:38|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:10:03|T|CDR|Got a few footprints around it for scale now, Houston.  You got your hammer, Charlie?
147:10:11|T|LMP|Yeah, I got the hammer, and I'm bringing the tongs and the scoop for a little fillet sample around it.
147:10:19|T|CDR|That's a good head .
147:10:23|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we might think of a padded bag sample here. There's one rock here that I'm convinced - Well, this big one's a breccia, but the other one looks like a crystalline rock.
147:10:39|T|CDR|Let me carry one of these -
147:11:11|T|LMP|Okay.
147:11:14|T|CDR|Charlie, you got your hammer locked into your pocket.
147:11:20|T|LMP|So nobody can steal it from me.
147:11:23|T|CDR|Let's see you give it to me, then.
147:11:26|T|LMP|How's that?
147:11:27|T|CDR|Tricky, ain't you.
147:11:30|T|LMP|Okay. John, let's find a good place to whack.
147:11:33|T|CDR|Let's get the fillet first, though -
147:11:34|T|LMP|Okay.
147:11:35|T|CDR|- we kick dirt all over it.  Actually, I don't see any fillet, per se. I think it just hit and made a - Stick it in the dirt. Stand it up in the dirt, Charlie.
147:11:54|T|CDR|tell which way is up . How about right there ?
147:12:00|T|LMP|Okay. Fine.
147:12:13|T|CDR|cross-Sun stereo; where are you gonna -
147:12:17|T|LMP|Okay. Just take a picture of it and I'll hold the scoop in. I'm gonna -
147:12:25|T|CDR|Get the - &quot;After&quot;, Charlie.
147:12:27|T|LMP|Huh?
147:12:32|T|LMP|Oh. Okay.
147:12:36|T|CDR|Can't you get that cotton-picking shovel out of the way?
147:12:39|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:12:45|T|CDR|Okay, now take a big hunk out of there.
147:12:48|T|LMP|Okay, here we go.
147:12:51|T|LMP|Man, you can't see anything with - shadow like that.
147:13:04|T|CDR|-
147:13:06|T|LMP|There we go.  Hey, John, here's a little piece just sitting up here on top of the rock that's got the -
147:13:26|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, that sample's in bag 374.
147:13:30|C|Eng|Okay; 374.
147:13:33|T|CDR|-
147:13:38|T|LMP|Let's see. We got to find a place to chip that.
147:13:44|T|CDR|Here's a place that's hanging out, Charlie. Charlie?
147:13:52|T|LMP|Okay, let's get a - Let me get a &quot;before&quot;. Why don't you put your hammer down there.
147:14:03|T|CDR|We've got enough documentation on the scale.
147:14:06|T|LMP|Okay. That looks great.
147:14:11|T|LMP|Got to hit it, it looks like.
147:14:13|T|CDR|Yeah, but it's right at a fracture set; it'll -
147:14:15|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:14:15|T|CDR|- come off in good shape.
147:14:20|T|LMP|Man, the whole rock's coming apart.
147:14:22|T|LMP|Super job, John!
147:14:23|C|Eng|Good show.
147:14:27|T|LMP|-
147:14:30|T|CDR|Wow! Boy! It was one of those fractures that's all included with glass.
147:14:36|C|Eng|Okay.
147:14:37|T|CDR|See that, Charlie?
147:14:38|T|LMP|Yeah, I see it.
147:14:39|T|CDR|One of those glass fractures sets.
147:14:40|T|LMP|Uh-huh.
147:14:41|T|CDR|I think the &quot;after&quot; on this one will be pretty interesting.
147:14:44|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, that -
147:14:46|T|CDR|Why don't you stick that one in my bag.
147:14:47|T|LMP|Yeah.  Is going in 340.
147:14:49|C|Eng|Okay, bag 340.
147:14:53|T|LMP|No, that was - Yeah; bag 340 for the rock.
147:14:59|T|CDR|Good luck, Charlie.
147:15:14|T|LMP|There we go. How cameras keep running in this dirt, I'll never know.
147:15:27|T|LMP|Ah, plop. Okay.  Got it.
147:15:35|T|CDR|Now, how about that rock over yonder.
147:15:37|T|LMP|That's the one I'm going for! Did you get the &quot;after&quot;?
147:15:47|T|CDR|won't have any trouble putting this back in place, Houston.
147:15:57|T|LMP|Look at that beauty, John! That is a crystalline rock. No breccia.
147:16:01|C|Eng|Absolutely great.
147:16:03|T|CDR|An old &quot;no-breccia, crystalline rock&quot;, huh?
147:16:07|T|LMP|And it is whitish to gray, with a lot of zap pits in it.
147:16:14|T|CDR|Sure is, I believe. A baby could run across one . It even has some ve - It even has what look to be - Almost - No, they couldn't - Those are zap pits, aren't they?
147:16:24|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:16:25|T|LMP|In fact, Tony, the whole area there's a lot of this rock here. Scattered all over; scattered around.
147:16:33|C|Eng|Okay, understand. Good.  We'll need a picture, and then we'll see if you can turn it over.
147:16:42|T|CDR|No, we can't turn that one over.
147:16:44|C|Eng|Okay.
147:16:46|T|CDR|Think we can turn that over, Charlie?
147:16:57|T|LMP|See that sharp corner? Right up at the top there?
147:17:00|T|CDR|Off the top?
147:17:02|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:17:04|T|CDR|Okay. Okay; I think I can get that. It's fractured right there.
147:17:08|T|LMP|Okay, I was thinking - Okay, that's good.
147:17:14|T|CDR|Aw, shoot; look at that.
147:17:31|T|LMP|Don't it look like pure plage to you?
147:17:32|T|CDR|I don't know what it is, though.
147:17:35|T|LMP|It's pure feldspar, it looks like -
147:17:38|T|CDR|Pure feldspar. Don't it look like it's been - It's so sandy looking, it could have been reworked or something.
147:17:48|T|LMP|Maybe partially shocked.
147:17:49|T|CDR|Shocked, yeah.
147:17:51|T|LMP|But it's pure plage - It's plage, Tony.
147:17:55|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
147:17:56|T|LMP|And it's in 341.  Whack off another piece right here, John.
147:18:01|C|Eng|Okay, understand it's pretty friable.
147:18:03|T|LMP|And this rock is pretty predominant.
147:18:06|T|CDR|Where, Charlie?
147:18:07|T|LMP|No, he didn't -
147:18:08|T|CDR|No, it isn't friable; it just fractured.
147:18:10|C|Eng|Okay.
147:18:14|T|LMP|Right at that sharp - See where the - Right there; yeah.
147:18:18|T|LMP|see how that comes off.
147:18:20|T|LMP|Pretty friable isn't it?
147:18:22|T|CDR|Yeah. Bet it's shocked.
147:18:25|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:18:32|T|CDR|Put that in the same bag?
147:18:33|T|LMP|Yeah, let's put them all - And there's another piece down there, if you - I'll get the tongs.
147:18:37|T|CDR|We got to get the &quot;after&quot;.
147:18:43|T|CDR|Okay, the first piece was off the top of the rock, the second piece is under the shadow of the - ha, ha - gnomon-shovel, and they're both going in bag number whatever Charlie says.
147:18:56|T|LMP|341.
147:18:57|C|Eng|Okay, we -
147:18:58|T|LMP|We're gonna have another piece that came out of the second whack.
147:19:02|C|Eng|Okay.
147:19:08|T|LMP|John, let's put this other piece in another bag, because this one has got no dust in it at all. Just hold that gnomon , let me &quot;Zee&quot; this one up.
147:19:18|C|Eng|And we'd like you to still have a try at turning it over.
147:19:20|T|LMP|Let's do it without getting any -
147:19:30|T|LMP|Well, we can try.
147:19:31|T|CDR|We ought to try rolling it down in that hole.
147:19:36|T|LMP|Okay.
147:19:39|T|CDR|There's a greenish hue to it, too, I don't - I'm making that up, maybe.
147:19:43|T|LMP|Okay. The other piece of that rock's going in 342, Tony, and that rock's pretty - I see at least ten other rocks around here that have that same appearance, so it's not a completely anomalous rock.
147:19:59|C|Eng|Okay.
147:20:04|T|LMP|Your bag's getting full, John.
147:20:08|T|CDR|Yeah.
147:20:13|T|LMP|I don't think we can turn that one over, but I think we can turn that one over down over there.
147:20:20|T|CDR|Which way do you want to turn it?
147:20:22|T|LMP|I was going to push it that way -
147:20:23|T|CDR|Think you're right.
147:20:24|T|LMP|- because we can get down below it.
147:20:25|T|CDR|Wait, let's move the toolage.
147:20:27|T|LMP|Okay.
147:20:29|T|CDR|Here's a rock with glass splattered all over its body.
147:20:32|T|LMP|Yeah, I see.
147:20:36|T|CDR|Let me do that, Charlie.
147:20:37|T|LMP|No, we can both lift it.
147:20:46|T|CDR|No way!
147:20:47|C|Eng|Okay, let's forget that one.
147:20:49|T|LMP|Budged once, but I don't think we're gonna do it.
147:20:54|T|LMP|Tony, there's one off at the 3 o'clock position of the Rover that I think we can turn over.
147:20:59|C|Eng|Okay, have at it. And remember we're looking for shaded samples and east-west cracks and all that kind of thing .
147:21:09|T|LMP|Yeah, well, there's nothing like that here.
147:21:11|C|Eng|Okay.
147:21:13|T|LMP|Unfortunately.
147:21:27|C|Eng|If you see one with a better developed fillet -
147:21:29|T|CDR|you'll never budge that rock .
147:21:30|C|Eng|I'm not so sure we got a good fillet on this last one, so we might be willing to sample another.
147:21:39|T|LMP|Okay.
147:21:55|T|LMP|Sorry that y'all gonna be looking up-Sun, Tony, but - Oh, man, John, that's a biggie.  Looks bigger than I thought.
147:22:05|T|CDR|Big?
147:22:06|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:22:08|T|CDR|Well, we'll take the documentation first, right? Stick the -
147:22:14|T|LMP|Yeah, let me take a cross-Sun.
147:22:17|T|CDR|I'll get the cross-Sun.
147:22:41|T|LMP|Hey, look;  got a good fillet around it.
147:22:43|T|CDR|It does.
147:22:45|T|LMP|Okay, let me turn over and see what that says . It doesn't have any dust on the top of it. I thought we could get the fillet sample here, but it doesn't have any dust on the top.
147:22:58|C|Eng|We don't need dust from the top. If this is a better fillet than the other, you might take a soil sample there, and then a reference soil away, and then a chip off the rock, and we'll have a good fillet sample.
147:23:09|T|LMP|Okay, this is a better fillet than the other one.
147:23:13|T|CDR|Okay, but I thought you didn't want breccias. It's a breccia.
147:23:25|T|CDR|I don't know whether it's &quot;tuff&quot; or not. You mean &quot;hard&quot;.
147:23:29|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:23:30|T|CDR|Not &quot;tuff&quot;, huh?.
147:23:32|T|LMP|Yeah, &quot;hard&quot;.
147:23:33|C|Eng|Oh, we'd prefer -
147:23:34|T|LMP|Let's take it - Let's try it, John, okay?
147:23:35|T|CDR|All righty.
147:23:36|T|LMP|We'll fill that square. Okay, fillet coming in from this side. There's a good one right over here. Already got the cross-Sun.
147:23:57|T|CDR|My personal guess is that fillet didn't come off that rock.
147:24:01|T|LMP|Mine, too.
147:24:06|T|CDR|375 .
147:24:08|C|Eng|Okay, 375.
147:24:16|T|CDR|Oh, Charlie; wait a minute. Wait a minute. Here, let me put this in your bag and give you a hand. Turn that. Got to get a rock off the top before we turn it, right?
147:24:28|T|LMP|No, they don't have to do that. They want a chip off of it, though.
147:24:32|T|CDR|That's what I mean.
147:24:33|T|LMP|Yeah.
147:24:43|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I got a footprint in , but I'll put the spade - the shovel - the scoop, rather - will be right west of where the fillet was taken.
147:24:53|C|Eng|Okay, good show.  And we'll need a reference soil.
147:25:02|T|LMP|Yeah, we'll get it.
147:25:04|T|CDR|Watch out, Charlie.
147:25:05|T|LMP|That's a hard breccia, ain't it?
147:25:06|T|CDR|A hard, hard rock.
147:25:10|T|LMP|Hit it right here on this corner right here in your shadow now. Down a little bit.
147:25:16|T|LMP|There you go. That's a -
147:25:19|T|LMP|Super!
147:25:24|C|Eng|Hey, Charlie, you just dropped a sample.
147:25:26|T|CDR|That just opened up a -  Charlie, you're bouncing around too much -
147:25:32|T|LMP|Thank you.
147:25:33|T|CDR|- your top came loose. Thank you, Houston.
147:25:40|T|LMP|Pretty good resolution , Tony?
147:25:42|C|Eng|Right.
147:25:46|T|CDR|Hey, am I - .
147:25:49|T|LMP|Could you stick that back in my bag, John?
147:26:02|T|LMP|What do you want?  John?
147:26:09|T|CDR|No, I just feel like my suit is pressurizing more. What are you guys looking at down there on the ground ?
147:26:15|C|Eng|Oh, we're seeing you bending over a big boulder.
147:26:18|T|LMP|What's your cuff gauge read?
147:26:22|T|CDR|No, no, on my suit pressure.
147:26:25|C|Eng|3.9.
147:26:28|T|CDR|Let me get it, Charlie.  Okay.
147:26:31|T|LMP|I felt the same way a minute ago, John. Dadgum thing's gonna be too big to go in there, anyway.
147:26:42|T|CDR|
147:26:44|T|LMP|Go ahead.
147:26:50|T|LMP|I got you. Get it?
147:26:53|T|CDR|Yeah.
147:26:58|T|LMP|Want to crack it in two or bring the whole - It's not gonna be any good unless we can get it in the sack.
147:27:02|T|CDR|It isn't gonna be any good unless we put it in the sack?
147:27:05|T|LMP|I don't think they'll ever recognize it again.
147:27:07|T|CDR|Oh, yeah ; throw it in my bag.
147:27:11|T|LMP|Let's - Okay.
147:27:18|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, that fillet - chip off that block -
147:27:22|T|CDR|Okay, and it opened up a clear fillet , and there's a lot of - This is a vesicular type of breccia.  - &quot;after&quot;, - .
147:27:36|T|LMP|Another piece that fell off here.
147:27:38|T|CDR|Don't worry about it, Charlie.
147:27:39|T|LMP|Well, I was gonna put it in a sack so they'll make sure - all that hammering, I don't want them to lose it.  Yeah.
147:27:50|T|CDR|Hey, let's push it over.
147:28:09|C|Eng|Okay; 343.
147:28:15|T|CDR|- to push that rock.
147:28:19|C|Eng|Okay, and you've got -
147:28:20|T|LMP|It might be better going the other way - downslope - with it, John.
147:28:23|C|Eng|- 15 minutes left.
147:28:37|T|LMP|That's too much work, John.
147:28:40|C|Eng|Yeah, don't strain yourselves there.
147:28:42|T|LMP|Maybe rock it out of there.
147:28:45|T|CDR|Well, you don't want to -
147:28:47|T|LMP|Don't worry. Okay; I need to -  getting a full sack, too, babe.
147:28:59|T|CDR|Hold this here for a second, Charlie?
147:29:01|T|LMP|Yeah, wait a minute. Let me get this top closed.  Turn around just a minute to your right; thank you. Okay. Go ahead.
147:29:20|T|LMP|think you can do it, John.  where I was trying.
147:29:23|T|CDR|You were trying to pick it up?
147:29:25|T|LMP|That's what I tried. Yeah, I tried from that edge, too.  You're not even budging it.
147:29:32|T|CDR|Well, you just can't get a grip on it.
147:29:34|T|LMP|No, you can't, not with these <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="alsj">gloves</a>.  Here's your hammer back.  we got to go off 5 meters and get a reference soil.
147:29:44|C|Eng|Okay, why don't we get that reference soil and look around for a little bit smaller boulder to turn over.
147:29:52|T|LM Crew|Okay.
147:30:04|T|CDR|I think the reference soil was back there at the soil sample.
147:30:08|T|LMP|Okay, here's a pretty pristine area right over here, John. We haven't been walking - We can just go over here and get it. Stick the shovel down there and I'll - Is that 5 meters? Yeah, that's about 5 meters.
147:30:25|T|CDR|Fifteen feet, maybe.
147:30:32|T|CDR|Okay, the shovel will be in the rocks - near these rocks - and we use the shovel to pick it up with, so -
147:30:49|T|LMP|And that serves as the locator, too, Tony.
147:30:51|C|Eng|Okay, that sounds fine.
147:31:01|T|LMP|What is it, babe?
147:31:03|T|CDR|I'm just looking for a boulder to turn over, and I don't see any.
147:31:06|T|LMP|There's a little one right up there; it's about a foot and a half.
147:31:09|T|CDR|That one right there?
147:31:10|T|LMP|Yeah, uh-huh.
147:31:16|T|LMP|Okay, Tony; is one scoopful enough?
147:31:18|C|Eng|Rog. One scoopful.
147:31:32|T|LMP|Got a little glass bead in it, John.
147:31:33|T|CDR|It does.
147:31:36|T|LMP|That's good. Went right in. Okay, that one shovelful, Tony-baby, is in 344!
147:31:56|T|LMP|Put it in my bag, John. Yours is full.
147:31:59|C|Eng|And -
147:32:00|T|CDR|
147:32:00|C|Eng|- we'd like you to use the rest of the time here just in documented sampling, if you don't see a more appropriate boulder than that foot-and-a-half one.
147:32:10|T|CDR|Okay.
147:32:11|C|Eng|And, we encourage you to just look for some variety.
147:32:12|T|LMP|There's one down there, John, but that's quite a ways down sl -  Down to your left.
147:32:22|T|CDR|How about this one right here. We can turn it over, Charlie. It just isn't very big, that's all.
147:32:26|T|LMP|That's right, that's what they just said; they don't want that one.
147:32:34|T|LMP|Agh! Whoops, here we go again. Give me a help.
147:32:42|T|CDR|Here you go.
147:32:45|T|LMP|Okay, just start pushing on my head.
147:32:49|T|CDR|Give me a hand.
147:32:50|T|LMP|Okay. Here we go.
147:32:52|T|CDR|There goes a bag.
147:32:55|T|LM Crew|There goes another -
147:32:56|T|LMP|- sample bag. Two bags. Gummit.
147:33:05|T|CDR|I think we ought to trade those bags - samples.
147:33:09|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm gonna empty them in the seat.
147:33:11|T|CDR|Huh?
147:33:12|C|Eng|Right, those babies look about full.<p>
147:33:12|T|LMP|, I think.
147:33:13|T|CDR|Yeah, I think we should do that.
147:33:16|T|LMP|They are.
147:33:18|T|CDR|They ain't - They're not looking it, they really are full. We ought to go trade them out, right now.
147:33:25|T|LMP|Okay.
147:33:26|T|CDR|Both sets. Before we do anymore hard work here. Let's go trade them, Charlie.
147:33:32|T|LMP|Okay; that's a good idea.  How are the consumables looking, Tony?
147:33:44|C|Eng|We'll get a number for you.
147:33:00|C|Eng|Okay, your consumables look pretty good. In fact, you may even be able to get a little extension.
147:34:08|T|CDR|Hotdiggity.
147:34:09|T|LMP|Super.  Ah, me.  Okay, let's see.  Stand that up, we're gonna be using that beauty.
147:34:37|C|Eng|And, Charlie, as long as you're back here at the Rover -
147:34:42|C|Eng|- we'd like you to take some 500-millimeters, when you get a chance, of Stone Mountain.
147:34:48|T|LMP|All righty; I'll do it.
147:34:51|T|CDR|Man, we were just up there.  You weren't paying attention, huh?
147:34:58|T|LMP|And, Tony, when I shade my eyes I can still see those lineations climbing right up to the southwest, and starting at the Cayley and going right on up across the mountain.  Let's change these bags -
147:35:16|T|CDR|- change the bags.  Bend over, Charlie.
147:35:22|T|LMP|Okay.
147:35:34|T|LMP|Okay, excuse me.
147:35:36|T|CDR|All right.
147:35:40|T|LMP|Now I'll get yours. We got a couple of core tubes - I tell you what I'll do, John. Let me get yours off of here.
147:35:48|T|CDR|Okay.
147:35:49|T|LMP|And -
147:35:52|T|CDR|Why don't you get the core tubes out?
147:35:55|T|LMP|Okay, I will. There's another bag under my seat that I could put them in.
147:36:01|T|CDR|Will they hold any more when we do that?
147:36:07|T|LMP|No, you're right.  Make sure these tops are down good here.
147:36:20|T|CDR|believe it.   -
147:36:35|T|LMP|See, that one wasn't on.
147:36:36|T|CDR|Huh?
147:36:37|T|LMP|Mine wasn't on.   -  Dadgum thing.
147:36:58|T|CDR|Charlie?
147:37:00|T|LMP|What? I think we ought to put them under our seats.
147:37:04|T|CDR|Well, let's open the gate here. We ain't got any room under our seats.
147:37:08|T|LMP|Right.
147:37:12|T|CDR|Okay. Now, you tell me why that thing - Oh, I can see from here.
147:37:29|T|CDR|Push down on that door.  That's got it.   - off of the thing it goes on.  Okay; let me get yours.
147:38:00|T|LMP|Do you want me to open the door?
147:38:01|T|CDR|No, I've got it now. There we go.
147:38:05|T|LMP|Without that camera , it's a piece of cake .
147:38:07|T|CDR|Yeah, it's -
147:38:08|T|LMP|Okay; now, that top is closed good and tight.
147:38:11|T|CDR|That one there is.
147:38:12|T|LMP|Okay. Now -  Okay, Tony, we're breaking out bag 4.
147:38:36|C|Eng|Okay; bag 4.
147:38:30|T|LMP|John, I think we can just leave those <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1201215" target="alsj">doomaflickies</a> - the core tubes - in there, and then when I get to the next place, I can -
147:38:42|T|CDR|You'll it like we normally do.
147:38:44|T|LMP|Yeah, I'll just use them out of there.
147:38:47|T|CDR|All you have to do is just pull it in the breeze, Charlie. It'll open right up.
147:38:53|T|LMP|Do what?
147:38:56|T|CDR|Pull it in the breeze.
147:39:40|T|CDR|Charlie, since I don't have to carry the gnomon any more, I could carry a sample bag in one hand. We could use that technique.
147:39:54|T|LMP|That's yours now; it's on.
147:39:56|T|CDR|Okay.
147:40:02|T|LMP|Okay. Now, there's one under my seat that's partially full of rocks. Why don't we get that. Just use that.
147:40:06|T|CDR|That thing is full, that's why! And there is another rock under there that has to go in -
147:40:09|T|LMP|Oh. Okay; we'll just break out a new one then.
147:40:14|T|CDR|I think you'd better.
147:40:24|T|CDR|Okay; I'm breaking out bag number 6.
147:40:27|C|Eng|SCB-6.
147:40:29|T|CDR|Goes to Charlie.
147:40:32|T|LMP|Okay, how much time we got left, Tony? This is taking a long time.
147:40:48|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Can you turn to the right a little and bend over?
147:40:50|T|LMP|Yep.
147:40:53|C|Eng|Okay. I guess we'd like -
147:40:54|T|LMP|Tony, this might be a good place -
147:40:54|T|CDR|Go left; excuse me.
147:40:55|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
147:41:00|T|LMP|Go ahead.
147:41:01|C|Eng|We're prepared to let you move on out as soon as you're reconfigured there.
147:41:08|T|LMP|Okay; I was just gonna say there's some good crystalline - that white crystalline rock that we picked up there. There's some good fist-size ones that would make good padded bag samples.
147:41:25|C|Eng|Okay. While you're configuring, we'll work that.
147:42:06|T|CDR|Oh, dear. All those kittens with mittens could do better than this.
147:42:14|T|LMP|Isn't that terrible? Isn't that terrible!?
147:42:26|C|Eng|Okay; Charlie. What SCB did you have on before -
147:42:34|T|LMP|I think it was number 2. Stand by.
147:42:39|T|CDR|There goes the fender.
147:42:41|T|LMP|Uh-oh.
147:42:43|T|CDR|Okay; it was number 2. Uh, oh. Sorry -
147:42:46|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
147:42:49|T|CDR|- That was mine. Charlie had number 1. Charlie had number 1.
147:42:53|C|Eng|All right. We copy that.
147:42:59|T|CDR|And I had number 2.
147:43:02|T|LMP|Okay; Tony. We're gonna start sampling again.
147:43:07|C|Eng|Negative. It's time to go.
147:43:11|T|CDR|It's time to go?
147:43:14|C|Eng|Yes sir. It sure is.
147:43:21|T|LMP|
147:43:21|C|Eng|Well, we'll get the padded bags later.
147:43:24|T|CDR|We were out there an hour? Been out here an hour?
147:43:30|T|LMP|Tony, we've been here an hour?
147:43:32|C|Eng|Yes, you have.
147:43:38|T|LMP|It doesn't seem like it.
147:43:40|T|CDR|Time flies, huh?
147:43:41|T|LMP|It sure does.  The old stop 9 .
147:43:52|T|LMP|&quot;Close&quot;, says me. Ha! It did. We lost a fender, Tony. The pusher-downer fender on the right rear wheel is gone.
147:44:07|T|LMP|Just exactly!
147:44:15|T|LMP|Okay. Station 8. Pan. Got the sampling. Rake soil was done. Okay; only one boulder sample. Sorry we couldn't turn one over, Tony. Okay; I was frame count 120, Tony.
147:44:35|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, Charlie. And we may get a boulder yet, you never know.
147:44:45|T|LMP|Okay; we've still got half mag of -  three quarters of a mag on the magazine RR . Do you want me to turn it on?
147:44:57|C|Eng|Yeah. Let's go ahead and turn it on.
147:45:02|T|LMP|Okay. We'll let her run, one frame a second -
147:45:05|C|Eng|Okay.
147:45:06|T|LMP|- f/8.
147:45:07|T|CDR|Okay; Houston. We're going Mode switch to 1.
147:45:12|C|Eng|Okay; see you later.
147:45:15|T|CDR|Rog. My frame count is 142.
147:45:17|C|Eng|Okay; 142. [Static; Long Pause]
147:45:45|T|CDR|Looks like you're in pretty good, Charlie.
147:45:50|T|LMP|Thank you.
147:46:01|T|LMP|Oh, dadgummit, John. I dropped my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="alsj">seatbelt</a>.
147:46:05|T|CDR|Here you go. Let me get it for you.
147:46:13|T|LMP|Okay. I got it. Thank you.
147:46:14|T|CDR|Got it?
147:46:27|T|LMP|You know, it's a shame we never did - get to see into Stubby; but that's a -
147:46:33|T|CDR|I thought you were looking in it from Stone there.
147:46:34|T|LMP|Oh, I did from there, but I didn't see that - I couldn't tell whether - You can't see this east side of it to see whether the thing is really filled in from a flow or not, or whether it's just subsidence. That's what I really wanted to find out.
147:46:50|C|Eng|Okay. And we have a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">configuration</a> change for the LRV.
147:47:05|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead with your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">config change</a>.
147:47:07|C|Eng|Okay. On the PWM Select, we'd like to go to 1. And, on the Drive Enables, we'd like -
147:47:17|T|CDR|Okay; we're in 1.
147:47:18|C|Eng|Right. And the Drive Enables, we'd like Left Rear and Right Rear to PWM 1.
147:47:23|T|CDR|Left Rear and Right Rear to PWM 1. Go.
147:47:26|C|Eng|And on Batt 2, Bus C circuit breaker, we'd like to pull that one; that'll load up battery 1 a little bit more. Batt 2 I guess is a little hot.
147:47:40|T|CDR|You want to pull Batt 2 Bus C circuit breaker?
147:47:43|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
147:47:45|T|CDR|Yeah. Okay, Batt 2 Bus C breaker coming open.  We're on - Is that it? Did that complete it, Tony?
147:47:58|C|Eng|That's it.
147:48:00|T|LMP|Wait a minute. Your drive power left rear and right rear is in Batt Bus C. That ain't gonna - You don't have any drive power.
147:48:09|C|Eng|Drive power should be nominal.
147:48:10|T|CDR|Yeah, you do.
147:48:10|T|LMP|I don't understand.
147:48:11|T|CDR|Yeah, that'll be all right.
147:48:12|T|LMP|Okay, fine; I don't know that much about it.
147:48:15|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; we're proceeding to Station 9.
147:48:22|C|Eng|Okay.
147:48:24|T|LMP|Okay, John.   &quot;Station 9, vacant lot.&quot;  Ah, we get to sneak up on one!
147:48:36|C|Eng|Right.
147:48:37|C|Eng|The idea is we're looking for an area as flat as possible with as little evidence of South Ray material. Probably, the words from the Backroom, you're looking for a shallow saucer.
147:48:50|T|CDR|They got the message all right. Yeah, that's going to be a real good find, Houston.
147:49:02|T|LMP|I don't think we can do it.
147:49:07|T|LMP|Okay; ten clicks , Tony.
147:49:09|C|Eng|Okay.
147:49:26|C|Eng|And could we have an amp reading with that ten clicks?
147:49:31|T|CDR|Right, we're doing - What does it look like, six or seven, Charlie?
147:49:36|T|LMP|Ten. Isn't that first one, 20, yeah, 10.
147:49:38|T|CDR|It's a little - Well, if you take the parallax out you'd be reading 10, Houston, but nobody can do that.
147:49:45|C|Eng|Okay.
147:49:50|T|LMP|I can still see the ascent stage of Orion, Houston.  And we're in a boulder field now that has a population of cobble size up through 15 centimeters covering 30 percent of the surface.
147:50:16|T|CDR|There a better place to go than where we are? To get there, I don't know where it would be.
147:50:21|T|LMP|This 015 for 2.7 and according to them, we're almost there.
147:50:29|T|CDR|I think, well, I think we're just too close to the ray patterns off South Ray.
147:50:34|C|Eng|Okay; we understand. All we can do is pick the best you see.
147:50:36|T|CDR|Don't you?  Okay; well, let's go on a little further closer to the LM and maybe we'll come across one that isn't so - That's more -
147:50:48|C|Eng|Okay. A worse problem -
147:50:49|T|LMP|- pristine. That be all right? Because there's no -  Say again?
147:50:56|C|Eng|Right. That would be fine, except a worse problem is to get contamination from the LM . We'd rather have contamination from South Ray than from the LM.
147:51:07|T|LMP|Okay.
147:51:08|T|CDR|All righty, we have just found your place.
147:51:09|T|LMP|There it is, right over there. See that big rock, John?
147:51:12|T|CDR|Yep.
147:51:14|T|LMP|Down in that big &quot;hollah&quot;.
147:51:16|T|CDR|That ain't a hollow; that's a crater!
147:51:19|T|LMP|Well, it's an old - Down where I come from, it's a 'hollah'.
147:51:23|T|CDR|Which one? That -
147:51:28|T|CDR|Okay; we're gettin - That's up a slope, up on the side of it.
147:51:32|T|LMP|Well, I know, but it's on the side facing the LM, so that would even be better.
147:51:38|C|Eng|You say it's on the side facing the LM? We wouldn't want to face the LM. We want to not see descent.
147:51:51|C|Eng|Good show.
147:51:55|T|LMP|Tony, you're - Yeah, no way to see the LM from over here.
147:51:57|T|CDR|Yeah, but Charlie, we can't get off and sample around it.
147:52:02|T|LMP|Why not?
147:52:04|T|CDR|Oh, okay; let's drive up here.  Uh-oh.
147:52:15|T|LMP|Yeah; you're okay.
147:52:17|T|CDR|Did you get a little dust there, Charlie?
147:52:19|T|LMP|No; just a skosh. Only trouble is, John, this rock's so big you can't even reach over it.
147:52:27|T|CDR|That's what I'm saying!
147:52:29|T|LMP|Yeah, but you can sneak around on the side.  This is a steep slope right here, babe!
147:52:36|T|CDR|That's what I was telling you! How about that rock right there?
147:52:43|T|LMP|That one right here is fine.
147:52:44|T|CDR|Okay.
147:52:51|T|LMP|Yeah, that's - Yeah, this is 180 parking, I guess.  Yeah. Let's don't get too close. We've got to sneak up on it. John, I can't get out.
147:53:11|T|CDR|Why?
147:53:12|T|LMP|You parked right in a crater, for me. That's good, now.
147:53:18|T|CDR|Yeah, but that ain't 180.
147:53:21|T|LMP|Okay; excuse me.   Everywhere - I say you parked in a crater - Everywhere you go, there's a crater. Might as well just take my chances. I'll take this.  Thank you. See that little hole you parked on there?
147:53:47|T|CDR|Yeah.
147:53:48|T|LMP|Okay; Tony, we're at 176, 007, 8.7. 2.6; 90, 90; zero - well, maybe 2 on the amps. So, left - the &quot;1&quot; battery is 100; 120 on 2. I'm still reading off-scale on all batteries -
147:54:28|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that and DAC off.
147:54:29|T|LMP|- I mean, all motor temps.
147:54:30|C|Eng|We copy that and DAC off.
147:54:31|T|CDR|Thank goodness .
147:54:46|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
147:54:47|T|CDR|Okay, we'll get old number 2 on the Mode switch.
147:54:49|T|CDR|Oh, there you go again, Charlie.
147:54:50|T|LMP|There I go again. Dadgummit.
147:54:51|T|CDR|Here you go.
147:54:53|C|Eng|And we'll need EMU checks.
147:54:58|T|LMP|Let me get up off the ground.
147:55:01|C|Eng|Okay; Charlie.
147:55:04|T|LMP|There you go. Okay. I got it.
147:55:07|T|CDR|Is my lens dirty?
147:55:09|T|LMP|Wait a minute. No, it's good, John.
147:55:10|T|CDR|Okay.
147:55:12|T|LMP|How about mine?
147:55:15|T|CDR|Can you turn towards the Sun?  I think it's okay.
147:55:21|T|LMP|Okay; fine. Okay, I'll get a pan out here.
147:55:25|T|CDR|Yeah, I'll get the old high-gain up. <p> <p>
147:55:39|T|LMP|Let's see, number 8. Ha, ha!
147:55:53|C|Eng|good picture!
147:55:57|T|CDR|Good show. Getting pretty good at getting the old Earth in there.
147:56:14|T|LMP|Tony, I bet you that Rover would have climbed to the top of Stone - Right on up.
147:56:23|T|CDR|Sure it would.
147:56:26|T|LMP|This is some machine, I'll tell you.
147:57:07|T|LMP|Yeah. &quot;After 2 , place gnomon.&quot; We don't have that . &quot;Cross-Sun stereo 'after'; down-Sun, locator. Do skim 3.&quot; Okay, so we don't get any pictures until we get the first two .
147:57:20|T|CDR|Well, you got the pan.
147:57:24|C|Eng|Okay. And before you leave the Rover, we'd like you to pull the Batt 2 Bus D circuit breaker. We'll let you put it back in before you drive off.
147:57:41|C|Eng|Okay.
147:57:46|T|LMP|And, Tony, a comment on this pallet . The locking on the tool harness - The locking ring on the pallet doesn't stay up every time. It's slightly inconvenient, but no big deal.
147:58:00|T|CDR|What are you getting, Charlie?
147:58:01|C|Eng|Okay, understand.
147:58:02|T|CDR|
147:58:03|T|LMP|I'm going to get a shovel for the scoop . And I thought we'd maybe - And I'll tell you what I got to do is fix up a - Start on a double core for the CSVC.
147:58:24|T|CDR|Okay; well, let me get these samples out of the way -
147:58:26|T|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
147:58:26|T|CDR|- doing that
147:58:28|T|LMP|Got to get this out of the way.
147:58:31|C|Eng|And, Charlie, was that DAC off?
147:58:42|T|LMP|Yeah, I got the DAC off.
147:58:43|C|Eng|Okay.
147:58:47|T|LMP|I think. Let me go check again.
147:58:52|T|CDR|Okay.
147:58:53|T|LMP|Hey, pan left, Tony. Thanks for reminding me, Tony, . I had forgotten it.
147:59:00|C|Eng|Okay.
147:59:12|C|Eng|Don't scare it.
147:59:19|T|LMP|That's the wrong way.
147:59:21|T|LMP|Hey, don't open -
147:59:23|T|CDR|What?
147:59:24|T|LMP|Don't open that.
147:59:26|T|CDR|It's between us and the LM! It's between the LM and us.
147:59:30|T|LMP|Oh, I know that; but they don't want you to open that thing until you get right up next to the rock.
147:59:35|T|CDR|Is that what he said?
147:59:38|T|LMP|Well, that's - Not just now; no.
147:59:39|T|CDR|Oh, yeah. Okay.
147:59:40|T|LMP|I'm going to get the other one -
147:59:42|T|CDR|Okay.
147:59:43|T|LMP|- for you.
147:59:46|C|Eng|We agree with Charlie, there. We'd like you to get up a little closer to it and face away from yourself before you open it.
147:59:55|T|CDR|Facing away from myself, huh? Okay.
148:00:02|C|Eng|Right, you're filthy, as Fredo says.
148:00:10|T|LMP|John, are you sneaking?
148:00:12|T|CDR|Yeah. Ahh!
148:00:18|C|Eng|Gee! We're missing the great rock hunt here.
148:00:26|T|LMP|You're just not watching him sneak, Tony.
148:00:29|C|Eng|I'd sure like to.
148:00:30|T|CDR|I gotcha!
148:00:37|T|LMP|What are you all doing looking at the seats!?!
148:00:40|C|Eng|Which way do we go?
148:00:48|T|LMP|Shh.  We're sneaking up on it, Tony.  Ah! Got him! Let me see, John.
148:01:01|T|CDR|You can't see, Charlie, that's -
148:01:04|T|LMP|From way out here, just point it at me.
148:01:06|T|CDR|Oh.
148:01:08|T|LMP|You don't have any -
148:01:17|T|LMP|Okay; here's the other one. Give me that one, I'll -
148:01:28|C|Eng|Gee! The first lunar Great Rock Hunt and we missed it.
148:01:36|T|CDR|Tell you something else. I leaned on the rock , and we can turn this one over .
148:01:40|T|LMP|We can.
148:01:51|C|Eng|Okay. Did that disturb the surface on the other side there?
148:02:00|T|CDR|The picture will show how I disturbed it.
148:02:02|C|Eng|Okay. It's important that you put this second one down in an area that wasn't -
148:02:06|T|CDR|No, we didn't disturb it at all.
148:02:07|C|Eng|Okay, good.
148:02:10|T|CDR|Yeah, we know that.
148:02:17|T|LMP|There you go. Get it?
148:02:22|T|CDR|Yeah.  In an area that that didn't go in, right?
148:02:24|C|Eng|Right.
148:02:25|T|LMP|Tony, John - John was sneaking just like this. He really got up to it before it - It didn't even know he was coming.
148:02:34|C|Eng|Outstanding, Charlie. Thanks for the rerun.
148:02:35|T|CDR|Ah!
148:02:36|T|LMP|Man, that thing flops open.
148:02:42|T|LMP|Okay, John, I'll give you a hint. Man, that's a great sneak. Okay; that's good. Right there.
148:02:52|C|Eng|Okay. Just a little pressure.
148:03:03|T|LMP|Beautiful! You picked some up on that one.
148:03:05|T|LMP|Only on one corner. He got some on one corner, Houston.
148:03:11|C|Eng|Okay, we'll have to take it that way.
148:03:13|T|CDR|That's too bad. That's the way the ground is.
148:03:16|T|LMP|Okay.
148:03:17|C|Eng|Right. Man, you fellas have outstanding finesse.
148:03:19|T|LMP|I'd say about 20 percent of it's covered.
148:03:22|C|Eng|Twenty percent is pretty good. That's fine.
148:03:24|T|LMP|I think 20 percent -  Okay, 20 percent of one corner is covered. I mean, 20 percent of the whole thing is covered.
148:03:39|T|CDR|I don't know. Let me take them back and put them under the seat. I don't know where they go.
148:03:43|T|LMP|I think they go in the SCBs. Tony, do these go in the SCBs?
148:03:48|C|Eng|They'll go in the SCB that doesn't go in the SRC .
148:03:53|T|LMP|Yeah, okay. We've already got that one collected.
148:04:02|T|LMP|Okay, John, that was beautiful.
148:04:05|T|LMP|Guess what.
148:04:07|T|CDR|What?
148:04:09|T|LMP|top open, again.
148:04:18|T|LMP|Okay, now we got to go get - After two, place the gnomon. I'll put the shovel. We got a cross-Sun 'after', and a down-Sun and a locator.
148:04:28|T|CDR|Okay. Well, that's going to be hard to get. Don't put the dirt all over there!
148:04:31|T|LMP|I didn't! I missed it.
148:04:34|T|CDR|Okay. It's going to be hard to get because -  I need to -
148:04:44|T|LMP|You can get a cross-Sun from over on this side.
148:04:48|T|CDR|Okay.
148:04:49|T|LMP|We don't have to sneak anymore.
148:04:52|T|CDR|We don't need a UHT anymore, do we, Houston? Are we going to need it for the ALSEP?
148:04:58|C|Eng|Negative.
148:04:59|T|LMP|We got one back there.
148:05:00|T|CDR|You got one back there?
148:05:09|T|LMP|Look at that!
148:05:11|T|CDR|Clean across the crater!!
148:05:19|C|Eng|Well, at least in the vacuum, it doesn't boomerang.
148:05:40|T|LMP|Ah, ha.
148:05:42|T|CDR|Okay, Houston; I'm looking back at the LM. Charlie, you can get a picture of the - I can get a picture if I put it on f/whatchacallit, and it'll show that rock is between us and the LM.
148:05:56|T|LMP|Sure is.
148:05:57|C|Eng|Hey, good show!
148:05:58|T|LMP|You can barely see the LM over there.
148:06:05|T|LMP|Yeah, well, wait a minute, we got to get a skim . Okay.
148:06:17|T|CDR|Okay. Can we skim where the pristine sample was?
148:06:19|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like to skim next to it.
148:06:20|T|LMP|No, they want it right beside it, right there -
148:06:23|T|CDR|You can't see any of that, there.
148:06:30|T|CDR|Okay.
148:06:48|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, I probably got 5 millimeters on that skim.
148:06:53|C|Eng|Okay, that's pretty good.
148:06:55|T|CDR|That's a pretty good little skim there. What setting should I open this up to show you these prints we got in the vacuum here?  I mean in the shadow?
148:07:09|C|Eng|Okay, I'll get you a number on that. Why don't you go ahead -
148:07:10|T|CDR|
148:07:10|C|Eng|- and get the deep sample.
148:07:16|T|LMP|Okay. I can hardly see in there, again. Okay, I'm going to widen -
148:07:23|T|CDR|That's going into bag 376? Did you give them that?
148:07:25|T|LMP|Yeah. No, I didn't.
148:07:26|T|CDR|Okay.
148:07:27|T|LMP|Okay, I got to widen this area.
148:07:28|C|Eng|Okay, 376.
148:07:30|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, get a scoop.
148:07:43|C|Eng|And, John, 5.6 at a 250th.
148:07:52|T|CDR|Okay. I'll get you a little flightline of that.
148:08:01|T|CDR|Okay, and Charlie's scoop is being taken right under the -
148:08:10|T|LMP|You got it.
148:08:28|T|CDR|Okay.
148:08:29|T|LMP|Okay, there you go.
148:08:30|T|CDR|That's going in bag 377, Houston.
148:08:33|C|Eng|Okay, 377. And you've got about 10 minutes now, and we'd like to get that CSVC .
148:08:43|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We can turn this rock over. If you want us to get that sample in, we need an extension.
148:08:54|C|Eng|Okay, we understand. We'll work on that.
148:08:59|T|LMP|Yeah, I'll go get the CSVC then.
148:09:00|C|Eng|All right.  We'll go ahead and do the CSVC.
148:09:10|T|CDR|Okay. Well, I can get -
148:09:25|C|Eng|John, can you turn that over by yourself?
148:09:30|T|CDR|Yeah, I was going to give it a go.
148:09:32|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds like worth trying.
148:10:01|T|CDR|Ah! Come back here, you rascal.
148:10:12|T|LMP|Getting a sample off of it, John?
148:10:14|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:10:29|C|Eng|John, you lost a bag.
148:10:32|T|CDR|Yeah; lost my whole set of bags. Oh, shoot.
148:10:56|T|LMP|May I borrow your hammer, John? This core - I think I might be able to push it in, but -
148:11:03|T|CDR|Okay.
148:11:07|T|LMP|&quot;Collision.&quot; Okay, we'll just do it right here.
148:11:11|T|LMP|Tony, I'm 15 meters out to the left of the -
148:11:18|C|Eng|Rog. We're watching you, Charlie.
148:11:36|C|Eng|Okay. And remember not to hammer this one all the way in.
148:11:44|T|CDR|- top of that -
148:11:45|T|LMP|Yeah, yeah. Got you.
148:11:46|T|CDR|The top of that rock is a hard breccia, and I'm just going to throw it under your seat, Charlie.
148:11:58|T|LMP|Okay. Is it in a bag?
148:11:59|C|Eng|Okay; did you have a bag number?
148:12:00|T|CDR|Huh?
148:12:01|T|LMP|Is it in a bag?
148:12:03|T|CDR|373.
148:12:04|C|Eng|Okay, 373.
148:12:16|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, that's about 7 centimeters out.
148:12:19|C|Eng|Looks good to us.
148:12:25|T|LMP|Feels good to me, too, to get that - .
148:12:29|C|Eng|Rog. It looks good.
148:12:30|T|CDR|Yeah, that's got it all - On all three sides.
148:13:11|T|LMP|He got it!
148:13:12|C|Eng|Outstanding, John.
148:13:14|T|LMP|He did it, Houston! He turned -
148:13:23|C|Eng|So you can not only sneak up on them, you can flip them over, huh?
148:13:41|C|Eng|Okay.
148:13:43|T|CDR|Before I stomp all over it, Charlie, sneak over here and let's get some of this soil.
148:13:46|T|LMP|Okay.
148:13:47|T|CDR|
148:13:47|C|Eng|Right. A chip off the bottom and the soil will probably do it.
148:13:54|T|CDR|&quot;A chip off the bottom.&quot;  I see a place where we can get a chip off the bottom, Houston.
148:14:04|C|Eng|Evidently you found the right boulder.
148:14:09|T|LMP|Right. That was a real good boulder.
148:14:12|T|CDR|Son of a gun's been laying out here all this time.
148:14:18|T|LMP|Okay, John, let me cap this - Let me cap this little beauty here before we lose it. Before I forget about it.
148:14:32|T|LMP|Okay, I'm coming with the scoop. What else do you need?
148:14:35|T|CDR|I need the hammer.
148:14:36|T|LMP|I got it.
148:14:44|T|CDR|Okay, you want to just sort of sneak up so you don't sprinkle any dirt down in the bottom of this place where we turned it over.
148:14:50|T|LMP|Yeah, okay.
148:14:51|T|CDR|- neat, Charlie.
148:14:52|T|LMP|Look at that soil! It's all caked looking, isn't it?
148:14:54|T|CDR|Yeah, it is.  Okay.
148:15:01|T|LMP|Let me get the soil before you start whacking. Okay?
148:15:04|T|CDR|Oh, yeah!
148:15:05|T|LMP|It's all glass-covered.  The bottom is glass covered, Houston.
148:15:14|T|CDR|Yeah, white glass.
148:15:18|T|LMP|No, the black stuff is the glass. That other is crystal - That's a crystalline rock.
148:15:21|T|CDR|Yeah, yeah. Well, that part of it is.
148:15:24|C|Eng|Very good.
148:15:32|T|LMP|And it looks just like an alkali flat in the cake that's under it, Tony.
148:15:40|T|LMP|And that's right from the deepest part.  That sample is right in the middle, which happens to be the deepest penetration that boulder made.
148:15:53|C|Eng|Very good.
148:16:02|T|LMP|Okay. There's a sackful!
148:16:05|T|CDR|379.
148:16:29|T|LMP|Where are you going to whack it, John?
148:16:30|T|CDR|place right there.
148:16:31|C|Eng|And, Charlie, your SCB is open, so a rock might come out.
148:16:33|T|LMP|Yeah; that's a good place.  Okay.
148:16:46|T|LMP|Real friable, isn't it?
148:16:49|C|Eng|Now you found a real rock.
148:16:50|T|LMP|Aha!! Look at that piece!  Here, let me get it, John. Back up. I'll go get it. There it is right there.
148:17:10|T|CDR|- , Charlie.
148:17:09|T|CDR|Can't you just pick it up with your shovel?
148:17:12|T|LMP|I didn't want to get it too dirty.
148:17:17|T|CDR|-
148:17:21|T|LMP|Ah!
148:17:24|T|LMP|Ooops.
148:17:26|T|LMP|There we go.  Okay, we got you about a 4-centimeter chip.
148:17:30|C|Eng|Okay, that sounds good. Just get some photos of it and I think we've done it.
148:17:59|T|CDR|That's going in bag 380, Houston.
148:18:03|C|Eng|Okay, 380.
148:18:07|T|CDR|It looks to me like it's a shocked rock with a lot of - and this is a guess - a lot of black glass in the fracture patterns.
148:18:20|C|Eng|Okay.
148:18:23|T|CDR|Okay.
148:18:24|T|LMP|Okay, I'll hold it .
148:18:25|T|CDR|Wait a minute, I got to reset -
148:18:43|T|CDR|Okay, that was a -
148:18:52|T|CDR|Frag was.
148:18:53|T|LMP|Frag was.
148:18:54|T|LMP|Close my top on that thing, John.
148:19:03|T|CDR|&quot;Thermal cover to&quot; -  Yeah; okay. Charlie, your old rear left OPS is open.
148:19:10|T|LMP|Oh, heavens. I can feel the heat leak.
148:19:19|C|Eng|Right. We caught you with your fly open.
148:19:23|T|LMP|Yeah.
148:19:29|T|CDR|Can you suggest any way to close it? I can't get it.  I can't get it.
148:19:37|T|LMP|Well, let's forget about it.
148:19:38|T|CDR|Let's go back to the -  to the Rover.
148:19:43|T|LMP|Yeah, I've got to close this CSVC up; take me a couple of minutes. You could go get a sample. Okay?
148:19:51|T|CDR|Fair enough.
148:19:56|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like you to pack up, John, if you could help Charlie. I think we'll have to get on.
148:20:05|T|LMP|He can't help me with it.
148:20:06|T|CDR|Okay.
148:20:23|T|CDR|Where is it?
148:20:32|T|LMP|It's in this SCB number 2.
148:20:34|T|CDR|Okay.  I'll get it. Just stay there.
148:20:43|T|LMP|I am. I just wanted to get - I got to plunge -  Okay, the plunger went right down, Tony. It's about 4 centimeters from the top.
148:21:06|C|Eng|Okay. And before you stick it in there , could we have the core tube number?
148:21:12|T|LMP|Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting that.  Thirty-four.
148:21:18|C|Eng|We copy.
148:21:23|T|CDR|Wait a minute, Charlie.
148:21:26|T|LMP|Slid right in. I never would have believed it.
148:21:28|T|CDR|I wouldn't have thought it, either.
148:21:29|T|LMP|I never would have believed that. Hope it's down in far enough to lock it, though.
148:21:35|T|CDR|You'll have to pull the bottom -
148:21:37|T|LMP|Huh?
148:21:38|T|CDR|Push the bottom shield off. I mean, pull that off.
148:21:40|T|LMP|Ahh!.
148:21:56|T|LMP|put the spade up.  What did you do with the shovel, John?
148:22:14|T|CDR|I laid it over there on the bench .
148:22:17|T|LMP|Okay.
148:22:18|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:22:38|T|LMP|Tony, that CSVC goes in the -  -
148:22:54|C|Eng|All right, Charlie, that CSVC goes in the SRC.
148:22:55|T|CDR|That goes in the SRC, Charlie
148:23:00|T|LMP|Yeah; that's right.  Rog. Okay. That's what I thought.
148:23:09|T|CDR|Okay.  Back to Station 10, Charlie.
148:23:11|T|LMP|Okay.
148:23:15|C|Eng|And, Charlie, before you get on there, we'd like the DAC on at 12 frames per second.
148:23:22|T|LMP|All righty-rooty!
148:23:36|T|CDR|And if anybody told me this thing would go up the side of that mountain, I'd have said, man, I don't believe -
148:23:42|T|LMP|I wouldn't have believed it. This is a real beauty.
148:23:51|C|Eng|Okay. And we need frame counts .
148:23:55|T|LMP|Okay -  Okay, Tony, I'm leaving with about 161.
148:24:02|T|CDR|I got 165. I probably ought to change this mag.
148:24:09|T|LMP|Do you want me to change the mags, Tony?
148:24:16|C|Eng|Yeah, let's both change.
148:24:21|T|LMP|Did he say both change?
148:24:23|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:24:25|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, I don't have a black and white left.  I'm going to run off a couple, John.
148:24:34|T|CDR|Okay.
148:24:42|T|CDR|I'm out. Three frames to go and I'm out.
148:24:44|C|Eng|Okay.
148:24:45|T|CDR|How about that?
148:25:05|T|LMP|Okay.
148:25:13|T|LMP|Got to hold it back and then pop it. There you go. Hold that; then pop her loose. There you go.
148:25:21|T|CDR|Which one, Charlie?
148:25:25|T|LMP|Delta for me and Bravo for you.
148:25:33|T|LMP|Thank you.
148:25:36|T|CDR|Bravo.
148:25:38|T|LMP|Right in the corner, there.   -   -  Okay! Magazine Delta is working, and I'm starting with frame count number, oh, about 1.
148:26:18|T|LMP|Dropped your bags again, John.
148:26:22|T|LMP|Aw, that thing did come off, didn't it?
148:26:25|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:26:28|T|LMP|Okay. Let me come around and help you put it on.
148:26:40|T|CDR|Okay?
148:26:41|T|LMP|Yeah. The tape's still there. This thing just peeled off under the tape.  Oh, boy; I almost -
148:26:59|T|CDR|Only happens in training. You got it.
148:27:02|T|CDR|How's my lens?
148:27:04|T|LMP|Turn into the Sun.  Okay.
148:27:09|T|CDR|Got your finger -
148:27:10|T|LMP|That's okay. Won't even see that.
148:27:16|T|LMP|Okay. The DAC is set at f/8 at 12 frames a second. And I'm not going to turn it on until we start moving, Tony.
148:27:22|C|Eng|Okay; that sounds good.
148:27:28|C|Eng|And we're going to have to move out.
148:27:29|T|CDR|Okay, and I'm -
148:27:30|T|LMP|Yeah, we're mounting up right now.
148:27:34|T|CDR|Frame Bravo of number 66.
148:27:39|C|Eng|Okay. We copy 66.
148:27:40|T|LMP|You get the TV, John?
148:27:47|T|CDR|I'll get it.  Okay.  Mode switch to 1.
148:27:58|T|CDR|Oh, somebody already did it.
148:28:01|T|LMP|They were looking at us with the big eye.
148:28:05|T|CDR|There's a glass - .
148:28:20|T|CDR|Okay.
148:28:26|T|LMP|All the steering?
148:28:31|C|Eng|That's affirmative, the rear steering.
148:28:32|T|CDR|clean now.
148:28:34|T|LMP|I know it. See, when you -  Okay.
148:28:40|T|LMP|Man, I'm glad that you're driving this thing. I can't reach those buttons down there at the bottom. You ought to get that before you get in.
148:28:51|T|CDR|What's that?
148:28:55|T|LMP|Drive - Rear Steering to Bus Baker.
148:28:57|C|Eng|Ah -
148:29:03|C|Eng|Right. We understand. We're loading up Battery 1; Battery 2's a little warm.
148:29:10|T|LMP|Okay.
148:29:11|T|CDR|Say again what he wants. Did you get it, Charlie?
148:29:17|T|LMP|No, I can't reach it; Steering, Rear, Bus breaker .
148:29:20|C|Eng|Roger.
148:29:21|T|CDR|Steering Rear to Bus Baker.
148:29:22|T|LMP|And what else, Tony?
148:29:23|C|Eng|The Drive Power to Bus Baker; Rear Drive Power.
148:29:30|T|CDR|Rear Drive Power to Baker. Okay, you got it.
148:29:33|C|Eng|Okay.
148:29:45|T|LMP|It's back to the LM. Right, Tony?
148:29:48|C|Eng|Rog. We going back to the ALSEP area.
148:30:06|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like you to drive gingerly up to the ALSEP area there, and we're going to ask you to hold the end of that broken cable up in front of the TV and that will be the Station 10 parking area. And then you can do the Station 10 tasks down to the south - correction - up to the northeast .
148:30:36|C|Eng|No, it'll be behind the mortar package. The task will be up to the northeast.
148:30:43|T|LMP|Oh, yeah, to the northeast. Okay.  That's my other northeast.
148:30:52|C|Eng|Right.
148:30:54|T|LMP|Tony, I can't get over how hilly this place is. It's one hill right after the other. Or ridge.
148:31:04|C|Eng|It sounds like an outstanding place. Sure wish I were there.
148:31:12|T|LMP|Well, we wish you were, too, Tony.  Okay, pictures are going. Tony, you're not going to see much out the right side of my in-motion Hasselblad because of this DAC camera magazine effectively blocks out that part of the field.
148:31:41|C|Eng|Okay. We understand.
148:31:44|T|CDR|Boy, but I -
148:31:52|C|Eng|As long as you have the DAC on, that sounds fine -
148:31:54|T|LMP|That thing's at 007.
148:31:54|C|Eng|- Why don't you swing the DAC back and forth a little bit occasionally during the drive and get a side view.
148:32:06|T|CDR|Anybody that ever called this place &quot;plains&quot; - Cayley Plains - really didn't know what he was talking about. There isn't a plain around here.
148:32:13|C|Eng|Right. Understand. Just like F smooth.
148:32:16|T|LMP|Right.
148:32:18|T|CDR|That's exactly right! FS smooth. I can't believe it.
148:32:25|T|LMP|John picked the only flat place within a kilometer to land.
148:32:31|T|CDR|Sure glad we didn't land on any of these slopes, I'll tell you that.
148:32:36|T|LMP|Look at Hidden - I don't know what this big crater is over here. This one -
148:33:06|T|CDR|And how many meters around?
148:33:09|T|LMP|Oh, I'd say -
148:33:10|T|CDR|900 meters long.
148:33:12|T|LMP|No, not that much. But 300, anyway.
148:33:16|T|CDR|Yeah, it's 300 meters across.
148:33:20|T|LMP|And it didn't even show on the map!
148:33:23|T|CDR|I tell you what it did show in.
148:33:25|T|LMP|What?
148:33:27|T|CDR|Those low angle looks that we got at the landing site.
148:33:28|T|LMP|Yeah, I'll say.
148:33:28|T|LMP|That fender was well needed, John. I'm being showered with -
148:33:38|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:33:39|T|LMP|- dust.
148:33:40|T|CDR|Didn't mean to do that. So am I.
148:34:05|T|CDR|Buried.
148:34:06|T|LMP|It's just buried. 3 meter - And it's buried from - Well, it's buried all over. I was going to say it's mostly from wasting from upslope, but that's not true.  And, off to our right is the big crater. The big, deep, very subdued that just shows - I see no large rocks, no outcrops at all anywhere around there. All I do is see big boulders that are apparently part of this ray. The biggest one being 2 meters.
148:35:09|T|CDR|I'm making 11 clicks , now, in this relatively smooth region.
148:35:28|T|LMP|Tony, it's a very old surface, apparently. Every crater here is very subdued, from the half-meter size up to the 4- or 5-meter size.
148:35:41|C|Eng|Okay. Copy that.
148:36:01|T|LMP|We're getting into an area now at 007, at 2.6 where it's more pebbly than cobbly, being 4 centimeters or so.
148:36:16|T|CDR|My -
148:36:17|T|LMP|Huh?
148:36:18|T|CDR|My whatchacallit just fell off.
148:36:20|T|LMP|The SCB?
148:36:21|T|CDR|No. Look and see if it's between my legs. Can you see over there? I can't see - I think it fell between my legs.
148:36:28|T|LMP|What thing?
148:36:32|T|CDR|My bags.
148:36:35|T|LMP|Well, I didn't see it, John. We've got plenty of those.
148:36:37|T|CDR|Got plenty?
148:36:38|T|LMP|Yeah.
148:36:39|T|CDR|Okay. Wanted to know whether to go back or not.
148:36:42|T|LMP|I don't think it's worth it.
148:36:46|C|Eng|Okay. And could we have a range and bearing, please?
148:36:49|T|LMP|Okay. We're at 007 at 2.6, and we can -
148:36:53|C|Eng|Okay.
148:36:58|T|LMP|- see just the top of Orion.
148:36:59|C|Eng|Very good.
148:37:00|T|LMP|And that Nav system, Tony, has got us pointed right at it.
148:37:05|C|Eng|Outstanding.
148:37:13|T|LMP|These little - Here's really a glass-covered one right there. Little round - Looks like a bowling ball.
148:37:19|T|CDR|We're doing V-max now, 8 clicks - 9 clicks; because we're going up a real steep slope.
148:37:34|C|Eng|Okay. Do you have a amp ?
148:37:45|T|CDR|We're all on the battery 1?
148:37:47|C|Eng|That's right.
148:37:48|T|LMP|40.  Yeah.
148:37:50|T|CDR|Okay - 40 amps! Yeah.
148:37:52|T|LMP|Yeah.  Okay, we just topped out on a rise, Tony; and we're going down into another swale. I can see Flag crater off at 11 o'clock, and we're heading 007. It 's boulder strewn on the south side.  Pointed straight ahead of us, between us and the Lunar Module at - Uh-oh.
148:38:22|T|CDR|What's the matter, Charlie?
148:38:24|T|LMP|The range keeps still saying two six . I think it's working. Well, anyway - You better belay that range, Tony. It's been 2.6 for quite a while.
148:38:41|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine. We agree.
148:38:46|T|LMP|We can see the LM, though.
148:38:48|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
148:38:49|T|LMP|Now we're going down in another 2- to 300-meter - maybe 500-meter subdued crater. That's really going to be a steep slope, if we go straight into it, but John is adroitly maneuvering around it.
148:39:05|T|CDR|I'm not going down that critter.
148:39:09|T|CDR|Look at that hole in the bottom of it.
148:39:10|T|LMP|I know it. Tony, it's a subdued crater without any rim at all. It is sort of oblong -
148:39:19|T|CDR|But look at that;  hole in the bottom has a ledge in it.
148:39:26|T|LMP|I know it. Tony, this reminds me of Big Sag. You know Big Sag on the map, west of North Ray. Then this whole area to our right -
148:39:40|T|CDR|Up. Up. Up.
148:39:42|T|LMP|Turn the camera around there.  I wish I could give you -   I can't turn it around. Best I can do.
148:40:11|C|Eng|Okay. Just going -
148:40:12|T|LMP|Tony, you remember those out in Hawaii -
148:40:14|C|Eng|- by time and speed, you're about 1.2 kilometers .
148:40:20|T|LMP|Okay. Then our distance and range is stopped.
148:40:23|C|Eng|Rog.
148:40:25|T|CDR|Our distance is - Our bearing appears to be okay.
148:40:34|T|LMP|Yeah.  Okay, Tony, you remember out in Hawaii, at Kapoho where we saw those very small little sink-hole craters?
148:40:44|C|Eng|Rog.
148:40:46|T|LMP|This looks like a big one of those.
148:40:47|T|CDR|The one down in the middle of that hole?
148:40:48|T|LMP|Yeah.
148:40:49|T|CDR|I agree with you. That's what I was thinking.
148:40:52|T|LMP|In fact, the whole area does, looks like just a big slump. Something fell out the bottom. Because there's no rim to this thing at all, John.
148:41:01|C|Eng|Okay. It'd sure be good if you could swing the DAC over that way, if it's still running.
148:41:06|T|LMP|I can't get it over that way.
148:41:09|C|Eng|Okay.
148:41:27|C|Eng|You should be out of film in the DAC.
148:41:29|T|CDR|Okay, where do you want? Right here?
148:41:32|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay, that's fine.
148:41:34|T|CDR|Did you get it?
148:41:36|T|LMP|Yeah. Could you keep on going around?
148:41:38|T|CDR|Sure.
148:41:39|T|LMP|Let's just make a 360 this way.
148:41:41|C|Eng|Okay, and get it on your Hasselblad, please.
148:41:44|T|CDR|Hey, that's a neat way to -
148:41:48|T|LMP|Okay, that's what we're doing.
148:41:49|C|Eng|Good show.
148:41:50|T|CDR|That would be a neat way to take a pan, Charlie.
148:41:52|T|LMP|That's just what I'm doing, taking a pan of that thing. Okay, we got it!
148:41:57|T|CDR|Okay.
148:42:00|T|LMP|Great.  Okay, we got a pan from the Rover, Tony, with a 360.
148:42:03|C|Eng|Okay. And if you can turn the DAC off -
148:42:05|T|CDR|Were you able to change the settings?
148:42:07|T|LMP|Yep.
148:42:07|C|Eng|- please turn it off.
148:42:30|C|Eng|Okay.
148:42:36|T|LMP|My arms are just too short -
148:42:39|C|Eng|Understand.
148:42:40|T|LMP|- to get that thing on and off from the Rover seat. I should have turned it on the side , but at 12 frames a second I thought we'd just run too much out. Okay, it's running now.
148:42:53|C|Eng|Okay.
148:42:57|T|CDR|I could tell you how it's doing, Charlie. I could glance at it ever so often.   Sure is comforting be able to hear those old wheels turning. You can hear them; they make a rumble.
148:43:20|C|Eng|We can't hear them, but we can imagine it's comforting.
148:43:22|T|LMP|A walking traverse in this place would be terrible.
148:43:28|T|LMP|Okay, still in a cobbly area, Tony. There're two - Apparently - To me there are two distinct sizes. Those are the 6-centimeter size and below - well, around 6 centimeter - and those around 15 centimeters. Cover 30 percent of the surface.
148:43:55|T|CDR|Okay, I'm V-max right now, Houston, and up slopes we're going about 8 and down slopes about 11.
148:44:06|C|Eng|Good.
148:44:08|T|LMP|The Nav system is gone completely, John. That bearing's not even working, I don't think.
148:44:17|T|CDR|Huh?
148:44:18|T|LMP|I don't think that bearing's working either.  Could our bus configuration cause - ?  don't see how.
148:44:30|T|LMP|What does the Nav system work off of, Tony? Is it Batt 2?
148:44:39|C|Eng|Stand by a second, Charlie.
148:44:41|T|CDR|Betcha it is. That's the LM up there, isn't it?
148:44:47|C|Eng|Okay. -
148:44:48|C|Eng|- Your Nav system works off Baker and Delta, so it should be on Baker, all right.
148:44:57|T|LMP|Okay. Well, it's not counting either range, bearing, or distance.
148:45:05|C|Eng|Okay. Is your heading working at all?
148:45:08|T|CDR|The bearing's working, isn't it?
148:45:10|T|LMP|I don't think so.  Yeah, the heading's working.
148:45:25|T|CDR|I'll tell you how we'll get back, Charlie.
148:45:37|T|CDR|Yep.
148:45:38|T|LMP|If you head for those, the LM was right in line with those from our last stop. And I'm convinced that bearing was good from our last stop we haven't changed much.  Okay, Tony, coming up into the area now to our 3 o'clock position - correction 9 o'clock [and] we're heading 020 - it looks like another one of those old subdued, sag areas.
148:46:09|C|Eng|Okay -
148:46:10|T|LMP|&quot;Burrows&quot;, let's call them.
148:46:10|C|Eng|- And we're going to cut back on our Station 10 just a little bit here, and we'll skip that photography of the heat flow cable. We'd like you to park halfway between ALSEP and the LM, and do a nominal station 10, except we'll drop the trench.
148:46:27|T|LMP|John -
148:46:28|T|CDR|Don't want to do the trench. Okay.
148:46:29|T|LMP|John, you lucked out.
148:46:30|C|Eng|Yeah, I bet that breaks you up.
148:46:35|T|CDR|Surprises me.
148:46:44|T|LMP|How do the consumables look, Tony?
148:46:46|C|Eng|Your consumables are fine.
148:46:51|T|LMP|Rog. We feel fine.
148:46:53|C|Eng|Okay. Good.
148:46:56|T|LMP|Okay. We're coming up on an area now, as we top a ridge, that is bouldery. About 10 to 12 percent of area is covered with boulders greater than 50 centimeters. And then it's cobbly, covering about 60 percent. Looks like, apparently, a secondary around here somewhere caused all this. But we don't see the crater.
148:47:33|T|CDR|Well, why don't we stay out here and set a new world's outdoor record?
148:47:37|C|Eng|Ah, we don't need that; we got to leave -
148:47:39|T|CDR|You don't want to do that, huh?
148:47:39|C|Eng|- something for 17.  We're going to set a new sleep record on this one.
148:47:44|T|LMP|Well, this has been fun. There's that secondary.   Okay, there's the secondary, Tony. We're coming up - On our 2 o'clock - 10 o'clock position, there's about a, what, 50 meters, John, you think?
148:47:56|T|CDR|Yep.
148:47:57|T|LMP|Fifty-meter crater that's a secondary; or, at least, it might be a primary, with these blocks just being out of it. And it's quite deep.  That's probably a prim - I don't know whether that's a secondary or primary, though.  We could tell. The block distribution seems to be radially equivalent . I think that was probably a primary punched into the old Cayley.
148:48:40|C|Eng|Okay; and, Charlie, we think the DAC's out of film now, if you want to turn it off.
148:48:45|T|CDR|It is empty. Reading empty.
148:48:48|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, it's Off.
148:48:52|C|Eng|Okay.
148:48:53|T|CDR|What's that thing up there on the hill, Charlie?
148:48:58|T|LMP|Where? Straight ahead?
148:49:00|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:49:02|T|LMP|That's a rock.
148:49:03|T|CDR|I was afraid you were going to say that.
148:49:04|T|LMP|We got to get over this ridge, John, and we'll see the old LM.  Man, I am covered from head to foot! With dust.  Boy, those fenders really are useful, Tony. This one we lost in the back has resulted in us being -
148:49:35|T|CDR|Pretty dirty.
148:49:36|T|LMP|- a Double Pig-Pen.
148:49:38|T|CDR|We're going to have to really brush.
148:49:40|C|Eng|Charlie, you mean you guys are getting dirty?
148:49:42|T|CDR|Maybe that's how we'll get our extension.
148:49:47|T|LMP|Nah. Been dirty.  I think we're going to probably come out a little east of where we need, John.
148:50:03|T|CDR|I wouldn't be surprised, Charlie.
148:50:08|T|LMP|But if we do, we ought to cross the tracks if we get too far east.
148:50:09|T|CDR|That's exactly why I'm going this way, old buddy.
148:50:11|T|LMP|Okay.
148:50:12|T|CDR|Hang in there.
148:50:14|T|LMP|You are sharp!
148:50:15|T|CDR|Yez.
148:50:17|T|LMP|You full blower ?
148:50:19|T|CDR|V-max.
148:50:21|T|LMP|Must be a pretty steep slope here. Man, look at those angular blocks there, would you. Around there.  Tony, here are 30 or 40 very angular blocks - 50 centimeters or so. And they have the same character as the ones we sample back , so apparently ray material.
148:50:46|C|Eng|Okay.
148:50:48|T|LMP|A little comment about the regolith. The regolith is texturally the same throughout. The only difference is the difference in albedo that you can see on some of the fresh craters and also in the rays as we were going towards South Ray.
148:51:15|C|Eng|Okay. And, Charlie, you can expect the feedwater tone.
148:51:18|T|CDR|Truly an amazing vehicle.
148:51:19|T|LMP|Isn't it?
148:51:22|T|LMP|Okay, I just got a flag of some sort.
148:51:25|T|CDR|Or is that me?
148:51:26|T|LMP|Huh?
148:51:28|T|CDR|Is that you or me? You expecting a flag, Houston?
148:51:35|C|Eng|Right. Can you -
148:51:37|T|LMP|I got a water flag.
148:51:37|C|Eng|- reach Aux water on the Rover?
148:51:40|T|CDR|Houston.
148:51:45|T|LMP|Houston.
148:51:46|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
148:51:57|T|CDR|How about that, sports fans.
148:51:59|T|LMP|Right on, babe. Right on.
148:52:05|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, we just topped the ridge, and the LM is about 200 meters from us.
148:52:14|T|LMP|I think we've had a comm drop.
148:52:23|C|Eng|John, Houston.
148:52:27|T|CDR|Go ahead.
148:52:30|C|Eng|Okay, we had our comm drop out here, and I understand Charlie got his water switched over?
148:52:37|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
148:52:38|C|Eng|Okay.
148:52:39|T|CDR|Yeah, Charlie's on Aux water.
148:52:42|T|LMP|Were you expecting that? .
148:52:43|C|Eng|Yeah, we tried to give you a call, but we had our comm drop out just about that time.
148:53:06|T|LMP|We want a nominal Station 10, so it's between the core -
148:53:09|C|Eng|Charlie -
148:53:10|T|LMP|If we stop over here to the right by that -
148:53:10|C|Eng|- your feedwater pressure's still building.  Okay, we've got it now, Charlie. Your feedwater pressure's going up.
148:53:23|T|LMP|Okay, I was on Min .
148:53:25|C|Eng|You're in good shape.
148:53:28|T|CDR|between the mortar package and the Rover ?
148:53:33|T|LMP|No - Yeah, that's a good place to park. I've got to go over here and get the penetrometer in line - Yeah, that'd be good. Mortar package and the Rover .
148:53:45|C|Eng|Sounds good to us.
148:53:59|T|LMP|We won't have any trouble navigating without that Navigation system, but it's just keeping them posted to where we are.
148:54:05|C|Eng|Right. When -
148:54:07|T|CDR|Yeah, that's what I think is so great.
148:54:07|C|Eng|- you get parked there, we'd like you to reset your Nav.
148:54:11|T|LMP|Okay.
148:54:15|C|Eng|180 .
148:54:16|T|LMP|Pointing south again. 180. Hook a right.  I can't believe how hilly this place is. There's not a flat place around!
148:54:27|T|CDR|Right, except where that LM is.
148:54:29|T|LMP|Except right there where that LM is.
148:54:32|T|CDR|It's really good. That saved us a lot of time.
148:54:43|T|LMP|Okay, it 's resetting, Tony.
148:54:45|C|Eng|Okay.
148:54:51|T|LMP|Okay, and the heading says we're at 176, 65. What's the - I can't read the number 2 Amp Hour.
148:55:07|T|CDR|Number 2 Amp Hour is reading as 110.
148:55:13|T|LMP|Yeah.  65 and 110;  110 and 120;  off-scale low, off-scale low; and off-scale low, off-scale low.
148:55:30|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
148:55:32|T|LMP|Wait a minute. The forward motors are not off-scale low; they're just coming up. Make that the rear motors; they're about 210.
148:55:43|C|Eng|Okay, 210. And we'll need EMU checks.
148:55:47|T|LMP|The forward motors are off-scale low.
148:55:48|C|Eng|Okay.
148:55:49|T|LMP|Okay, let me get out of this thing.
148:55:51|T|CDR|Okay, mine is holding pressure at 3.95; I'm <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="alsj">between Minimum and Intermediate </a>. I don't have any flags and my O2 is so covered with dust, I can't tell what it is.  But it looks like - Hmmm.
148:56:25|T|LMP|Tony, I think I got -  Dadgummit.
148:56:34|T|CDR|I can't tell.
148:56:35|C|Eng|That's okay, John. We read 35 percent down here.
148:56:38|T|LMP|Well, I got -
148:56:42|T|CDR|Okay, Yeah. It looks up above 25, anyway. 25, 35. There you go.
148:56:47|T|LMP|That's what mine is, too, Tony, about 33. And I got 3.8, Min cooling, and I've got just a water flag. And the Aux water's on.
148:56:59|C|Eng|Okay, sounds good.
148:57:04|T|LMP|Look at this place . It is filthy. <p>
148:57:15|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Going to 3 .
148:57:18|C|Eng|Okay.
148:57:33|T|LMP|Okay, lets see. There's the core. I need the - . Okay; we got them.
148:57:50|C|Eng|Okay, that sounds good.  And, John, since we're running behind here, I wonder if you can operate the penetrometer.
148:58:10|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:58:23|T|LMP|Tony, how about an extension, you guys? We're feeling good.
148:58:26|C|Eng|Oh, we understand and we can understand why you wouldn't want to get back in, but we'd like you to get back in on time. And you've got a lot of science there, so don't worry about it.
148:58:47|T|CDR|You said all we was gonna do tonight is sit around and talk!
148:58:52|C|Eng|Well, we like to hear you talk.
148:58:57|T|LMP|Tony, we could really -
148:58:59|T|CDR|Yeah, especially on a hot mike, huh?
148:59:01|C|Eng|That just makes it more interesting.
148:59:05|T|LMP|Ten minutes and we could get all this done, Tony. How about 10 minutes, Tony? Please.
148:59:14|T|LMP|John, you got the shovel - Yeah.
148:59:17|T|LMP|What? I don't see. What? What?  What?
148:59:23|T|CDR|Somebody up there likes us. That bag number 4, see where it is?
148:59:29|T|LMP|Came off, huh?
148:59:30|T|CDR|Came off, and it's hanging between the fender and the frame.
148:59:36|T|LMP|That is amazing.
148:59:37|T|CDR|Yeah.
148:59:55|T|CDR|-
149:00:00|T|LMP|Come on, Tony. Pretty please?
149:00:01|C|Eng|We're working it!  Okay, we'll go ahead and give you 10 minutes.
149:00:06|T|CDR|Tony, is -
149:00:07|C|Eng|How's that? Just shows that we love you.
149:00:10|T|LMP|Atta boy. Let's hear it for old Flight. An &quot;atta boy&quot; for Flight.
149:00:18|C|Eng|Yea!
149:00:26|T|LMP|Okay.
149:00:29|T|CDR|Want me to help you with the penetrometer?
149:00:32|T|LMP|Well, I've got the double core right now.
149:00:36|C|Eng|Okay, we'll still drop the trench -
149:00:38|T|CDR|Okay; well, this would be an opportunity for me -
149:00:39|C|Eng|- and do everything else as nominal.
149:00:46|T|LMP|I bet you I don't get this in here, but I'll try it.
149:00:49|T|CDR|I think you will.
149:00:55|T|LMP|I don't know. Okay, that's pushed in.
149:00:59|T|CDR|Let me do that, and you do the penetrometer because I know how to do that one.
149:01:02|T|LMP|Okay. That's a good swap.
149:01:10|T|LMP|Gummit.
149:01:14|T|LMP|John, see if I got the red dot on my camera. It stopped running.
149:01:22|T|CDR|Sure do.
149:01:23|T|LMP|Okay, how about spinning it once for me.
149:01:37|T|CDR|- I went to - There you go.
149:01:45|T|CDR|Got it.
149:01:46|T|LMP|Super.
149:01:50|T|LMP|I'll get it, cross-Sun as far you can push it in.
149:01:54|T|LMP|Okay. You want to hammer on this?
149:01:55|T|CDR|Yeah.
149:01:58|T|LMP|Okay; now the stuff to -
149:02:01|T|CDR|Take it apart with.
149:02:02|T|LMP|- take it apart with, it's back in the back .
149:02:03|T|CDR|Okay.
149:02:04|T|LMP|They want you to take both of them off together and then ram it home before you separate the two.
149:02:12|T|CDR|Understand.
149:02:13|T|LMP|And the top of the bottom one is back here next to the LSM .
149:02:17|T|CDR|Okay.
149:02:20|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, which - You want me to start with the 0.5?
149:02:27|C|Eng|Right, it will be the 0.5 - Well, actually you have the 0.2 on there. Why don't you do the string of 0.2 and then we'll come back and get the 0.5 near the double core.
149:02:38|T|LMP|Well; no, I took the 0.2 off.
149:02:41|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
149:02:42|T|LMP|I don't have anything on here now.
149:02:44|C|Eng|Fine, let's press for the 0.5.
149:02:49|T|LMP|Okay. It gets hard down there, doesn't it, John?
149:02:54|T|CDR|Yeah, I don't think it's going to go.  , "How many hits you want me to give it, Houston, before I quit.
149:03:05|C|Eng|Okay, it's not going down at all?
149:03:15|T|LMP|Yeah, you're getting it a little bit, John.
149:03:21|T|LMP|It's going in, John; about a quarter inch a stroke.
149:03:23|T|CDR|That figures.
149:03:38|T|CDR|Ohhh!
149:03:40|T|LMP|I did the same -
149:03:41|T|CDR|Whoa!
149:03:42|T|LMP|I did the same thing.
149:03:59|C|Eng|John, it's too late to change your mind; you got to hammer that one; no trenches.
149:04:07|T|CDR|Crazy.  Should have kept my mouth shut.
149:04:12|T|LMP|Dadgummit! That thing came off again.
149:04:16|C|Eng|It may have a bad latch in it.
149:04:23|T|CDR|Now I'm on Intermediate cooling, Houston.
149:04:26|C|Eng|Okay, John, you've probably hammered on that long enough. Why don't we just call it enough.
149:04:32|T|LMP|It's in! John, it's in. That's far -
149:04:36|T|CDR|How far do you want to drive it, Charlie?
149:04:38|T|LMP|That's far enough!
149:04:39|T|CDR|Drive it all the way in?
149:04:41|T|LMP|Yeah, they don't want any more than that.
149:04:42|C|Eng|Okay, that looks good.
149:04:51|T|CDR|Aghh!
149:04:52|T|CDR|Gee, it came right back out, too.
149:04:53|T|LMP|Yeah, that's the amazing part.
149:05:00|T|CDR|That is amazing.
149:05:09|C|Eng|Okay, John, you want to turn that over? That stuff may come out of that.
149:05:35|T|CDR|Okay.
149:05:36|T|LMP|Okay, I finally got that five-tenths back on. And I got number 6 , Tony. Is that okay?
149:05:53|T|LMP|I don't think I've used 6.
149:06:02|T|CDR|Where are the core caps at, Charlie?
149:06:04|T|LMP|In the HTC. How about an answer, Tony?
149:06:09|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
149:06:11|T|LMP|I'll bypass - I'm on 9 -
149:06:13|C|Eng|Yeah, 9's good, Charlie.
149:06:14|T|LMP|I'm going to bypass 9 and go to 10.
149:06:17|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine, too.
149:06:18|T|LMP|I just passed it on. I'm going to go to 10.  Okay.  Let's see, there's -
149:06:31|C|Eng|Okay. And that one should be fairly near the double core, Charlie.
149:06:38|T|LMP|It is, within 3 meters - 2 meters.
149:06:42|C|Eng|That's fine.
149:06:43|T|LMP|Is that okay?  Okay.
149:06:48|T|CDR|Look at that! The core tube caps go on and everything.
149:07:04|T|LMP|Okay, that bottomed it out, Tony.
149:07:06|C|Eng|Okay, we can see that.
149:07:07|T|LMP|On the 0.5 .
149:07:08|C|Eng|That looks good. Why don't we go to a 0.2 and do it just in the same place.
149:07:13|T|LMP|I've got almost -  Okay.  And then work towards the -
149:07:19|C|Eng|Work towards the deep core .
149:07:22|T|LMP|Is this the last time we use this thing ?
149:07:26|C|Eng|It should be.
149:07:28|T|LMP|I can't remember. We don't have it on - On EVA-3, we don't use it, huh?
149:07:33|C|Eng|Not right now.
149:07:37|T|LMP|Well, I'll put it back, anyway.  John, could you move over a skosh, let me -
149:07:45|T|CDR|Yeah, that rammer-jammer only went in an inch!
149:07:49|T|LMP|That's okay.
149:07:50|C|Eng|That's okay, as long as it gets out of the cap.
149:07:51|T|CDR|Isn't that the way it's supposed to go in?
149:07:52|T|LMP|Yeah. Well, you got it so full -  You probably got it so full -
149:08:03|T|CDR|That mess them up?
149:08:04|T|LMP|Nah. You're going to leave that cap on it, anyway.
149:08:07|T|CDR|That's what I thought. That cap stays on.
149:08:09|T|LMP|Yeah. Until it gets back to Houston.
149:08:14|T|LMP|There's the 0.2 .
149:08:16|T|LMP|Going to 11, Tony.
149:08:17|C|Eng|Okay.
149:08:23|T|CDR|Hey, where's the top thing that goes on it, Charlie?
149:08:26|T|LMP|Okay. The one for the bottom is right there by the LSM , on top of the pallet. And a cap goes on the top part . You see it?
149:08:47|T|CDR|Boy, I sure don't.
149:08:48|T|LMP|Okay. Right by the LSM, by the LPM, there's a screw on just like on the top part.
149:08:56|T|CDR|Yeah.
149:08:57|T|LMP|Okay. That screws back in the bottom part.
149:09:00|T|CDR|Yeah, but what -
149:09:21|T|LMP|There you go. You got it. There. That's good.
149:09:25|T|LMP|Now ram that one , and then put a cap on the other one and give them the numbers.
149:09:39|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Here come the two tenths .
149:09:46|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds good, Charlie.
149:09:57|T|CDR|Where do these live, Charlie? The SCB?
149:09:59|T|LMP|Put them under my seat.
149:10:01|T|CDR|Okay.  The numbers of these things -
149:10:06|T|LMP|Okay, the two-tenths almost went in all the way.
149:10:10|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. We see that.
149:10:11|T|CDR|Okay, the upper one was 45; the bottom one was 4.
149:10:18|C|Eng|Okay, John. Sounds good.
149:10:23|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Be advised I'm sorry that I'm spiking this thing out occasionally , but this is the only way we can do it.
149:10:30|C|Eng|That's fine, Charlie. We see the problem.
149:10:34|T|LMP|Okay, I'm moving. I've got two more to do, cycling to 12. And this is about a fourth of the way . Right here. Okay.  Okay, number 12.
149:10:59|C|Eng|And, John, we should wait on your pan until Charlie's through there.
149:11:05|T|CDR|Understand.
149:11:08|T|LMP|Agh! Okay. That's about the same distance, Tony.
149:11:10|C|Eng|Okay.
149:11:14|T|LMP|Cycling to 13.
149:11:36|C|Eng|Hey, John. While you're sampling -
149:11:37|T|LMP|Okay, I'm -
149:11:38|C|Eng|- there, you might look around and see if you see any of that vesicular basalt.
149:11:46|T|CDR|That's what I'm a looking for.
149:11:53|T|LMP|Oop!
149:11:58|T|LMP|Okay.
149:11:59|C|Eng|We see that one went all the way in.
149:12:17|T|LMP|But there it is, all but about 5 inches.
149:12:22|C|Eng|Okay.
149:12:23|T|LMP|That one was smooth.
149:12:24|C|Eng|Okay. And, John, stand by for a feedwater tone.
149:12:30|T|CDR|Just got it!
149:12:32|C|Eng|How's that ?
149:12:34|T|CDR|I hope.
149:12:43|C|Eng|And go on Aux water.
149:12:45|T|LMP|Okay. Cycling to -
149:12:48|T|CDR|Okay.
149:12:49|T|LMP|- cycling to 14.
149:12:52|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie.
149:13:06|T|LMP|And I'm right by the double core. I mean the deep core.
149:13:12|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds good.
149:13:13|T|LMP|The ground's pretty beat up with -  Okay, but it's pretty beat up with footprints. Should I go to a pristine area or stay here?
149:13:23|C|Eng|Just move it over out of the footprints.
149:13:32|C|Eng|Okay.
149:13:48|T|LMP|That one's going all the way in, too.
149:13:51|T|LMP|If I didn't lose my balance.
149:13:54|C|Eng|Good show.
149:13:56|T|LMP|Bet I can't get up.
149:14:01|T|LMP|There we go.  Recovery. Bing!
149:14:13|T|LMP|Poor ol', heat flow.
149:14:17|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. One flat plate by the double core, and that'll about do her.
149:14:24|T|LMP|Okay.
149:14:33|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, that connector, the printed circuit on the heat flow is still in.
149:14:40|C|Eng|Okay. We understand.
149:14:41|T|LMP|It looked like the silver part broke off right where it's mated into the printed circuit.
149:14:55|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
149:15:07|T|LMP|prints on the Moon.  I can't believe it.
149:16:04|T|CDR|But, Charlie. I just don't see any vesicular basalt.
149:16:07|T|LMP|I don't either.
149:16:08|T|CDR|It's sort of like 'they're always there when you need them'.
149:16:22|T|LMP|Crummy thing.
149:16:37|C|Eng|And, John, as Charlie takes -
149:16:38|T|LMP|Okay. That's the flat plate, Tony, and I'm -
149:16:39|C|Eng|- that penetration, we can go ahead and take your pans.
149:16:47|T|CDR|Okay, Houston.
149:16:48|T|LMP|Cycling to 15.
149:16:50|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
149:16:54|T|LMP|And it's somewhere between this mass of footprints.   Aha, there it is.  Okay, Tony, right beside the double core.
149:17:13|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie.
149:17:22|T|LMP|Okay, that was a pretty good one. I think it's going to turn out; and it went in about 6 centimeters.
149:17:37|C|Eng|Outstanding.
149:17:42|T|LMP|Yeah. Let me try one out here in a pristine area to see if that's - A couple of meters away, here. I wonder whether all that foot walking over there might have just fouled that up.
149:17:59|T|LMP|Nope. It was pretty good, Tony! That one went in about the same.
149:18:01|C|Eng|Rog. We had that one on TV.
149:18:05|T|LMP|Okay.
149:18:14|T|CDR|Charlie?
149:18:15|T|LMP|Yeah.
149:18:16|T|CDR|Can you see if my lens is dirty?
149:18:19|T|LMP|Yeah; just a minute.  Turn around this way, John. I've got to look in the Sun.
149:18:30|T|LMP|Towards me. Towards the -  Slight dust but not much, it's okay.
149:18:39|T|CDR|Okay; fine.
149:18:46|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I collected one sample, which was a sharp, angular .
149:18:57|C|Eng|Okay. And we're going to have to pack up and head home.
149:19:03|T|LMP|Okay.
149:19:04|T|CDR|Okay.
149:19:06|T|LMP|Home is about 50 meters away.
149:19:12|T|CDR|Can you put this back there, Charlie?
149:19:13|T|LMP|Yeah.
149:19:18|T|LMP|There, I thought we had lost this rake here for a minute, but there it is.
149:19:26|T|CDR|And that sample is going in bag sample 381, and I'll shoot the pan here in a second.
149:19:30|C|Eng|Okay, 381.
149:19:48|C|Eng|Okay.
149:19:49|T|CDR|In a lot of ways, it's the same type as we've been sampling it. Going into sample bag 4 on top of the sample 9 samples.
149:20:03|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm up to frame count 91 on magazine Delta.
149:20:08|C|Eng|Okay; we copy, Charlie.
149:20:14|T|LMP|Tony, does the - I can't remember. Does the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy76.gif" title="image" target="alsj">CSVC</a> go into the rock box?
149:20:26|C|Eng|Yes, it does.
149:20:30|T|LMP|Okay.
149:20:40|T|LMP|Hey, John, I'm going to take that SCB number 2, my camera, and I'm heading home.
149:20:45|T|CDR|Okay.
149:20:51|T|LMP|Boy, is this fun.
149:21:14|C|Eng|Okay, John; 89.
149:21:17|T|CDR|Okay, the Mode switch is going to 1.
149:21:21|C|Eng|Okay. And, John, when you get inside , we have a configuration change in LRV.
149:21:28|T|CDR|Okay.  Charlie's already back at the LM.
149:21:39|C|Eng|Rog. We saw that before you went off
149:21:40|T|CDR|He walks a lot faster than I do.  Okay. Talk with the configuration change.
149:21:50|C|Eng|Okay. Except for the PWM Select and the Drive Enables, we would like everything back to nominal. Circuit breakers in; and Drive Power on Bus Delta. , Steering on Bus Delta.  That's Rear Steering.
149:22:13|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.  And we understand you reset before you came.
149:22:20|T|LMP|Tony, looking back up -  Yeah, I did that.
149:22:25|C|Eng|Okay.
149:22:26|T|CDR|Huh?
149:22:28|T|LMP|Reset the Nav.
149:22:30|T|CDR|Yeah, we're reset now.
149:22:44|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, do we put as many core tubes as we can in the rock box also?
149:22:53|C|Eng|We'll work that, Charlie.
149:22:56|T|CDR|Boy, the speed - .
149:22:58|T|LMP|How about the core tubes, do we put all the core tubes in the rock box also?.
149:23:06|C|Eng|Okay. Charlie, we can put four -
149:23:08|T|CDR|Looks like the bearing is working okay.
149:23:09|C|Eng|- core tubes plus the CSVC in the rock box and then plus what documented samples you can get in there.
149:23:16|T|LMP|Okay; four core tube, CSVC, documented sample, gotcha.
149:23:20|C|Eng|Rog.
149:23:21|T|LMP|Okay. Looking back towards Stone Mountain, Tony -
149:23:24|T|CDR|Charlie, let me park the LM right there.
149:23:26|T|LMP|Okay. The LM is already parked; but you sure can park the Rover.
149:23:30|T|CDR|All right. Fair enough.
149:23:32|T|LMP|Okay. Looking back towards Stone Mountain, Tony, I don't see the Rover tracks.
149:23:42|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine. We're a little bit behind the timeline there, Charlie. I think we better get closed out.
149:23:50|T|LMP|Okay, we're doing that right now, as fast as we can.
149:23:52|C|Eng|Okay. I understand.
149:23:55|T|LMP|John's back at the - John's at the Rover .
149:24:08|T|CDR|Okay, 3. LRV powerdown - - reset the Far UV, Charlie.
149:24:36|T|CDR|Roger.
149:24:40|C|Eng|You don't have to go up to it.
149:24:42|T|CDR|From the Rover you want me to take that picture?
149:24:43|C|Eng|Yeah, just take it anywhere. As long as we can see that location, that's all we're looking for.
149:24:50|T|CDR|Okay.
149:24:53|T|LMP|Okay, you're aligned, Tony, with signal strength about 4.
149:24:55|C|Eng|Okay, we got a good picture.
149:24:56|T|LMP|TV Remote.  Okay.
149:25:03|T|CDR|Actually, just the normal old thing ought to catch it, Houston; because it's not in Sun but there sure is a lot of Sun behind it and on it and all that. Very strange. It's in shadow.
149:25:20|C|Eng|Okay. I guess they wanted to see into the shadow a little bit.
149:25:23|T|CDR|- that?  Okay. Well, I mean the leg - the shadows - You'll be able to see it fine.
149:25:36|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, you want to Reset ?
149:25:38|C|Eng|Roger. Reset and I have new setting.
149:25:44|T|CDR|Okay. Let me watch the wheels go around.
149:25:53|T|CDR|Reset; and it did work. It's working.
149:25:57|C|Eng|Okay.
149:25:58|T|CDR|And what are the new settings, Houston?
149:26:02|C|Eng|Azimuth, 326.
149:26:05|T|CDR|326.
149:26:06|C|Eng|And elevation, 16.
149:26:18|T|CDR|Okay.
149:26:25|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm putting core tubes 29 43 45, and 54 in the rock box.
149:26:44|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
149:26:49|T|LMP|CSVC is in the rock box. Packing it right now.
149:26:53|C|Eng|Okay.
149:26:56|T|LMP|You want an unbagged rock in the rock box, Tony? I don't think you do.
149:27:03|T|CDR|Okay, a 326, and what's the elevation, Houston.
149:27:06|C|Eng|Sixteen.
149:27:10|T|CDR|Sixteen.
149:27:27|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, 326 and 16.  That's set and she's going.
149:27:37|C|Eng|Okay. Charlie, yeah, you can put unbagged rocks in the SRC.
149:27:43|T|LMP|Okay.
149:28:06|T|CDR|Got the hammer, Charlie?
149:28:08|T|LMP|It's in the thing here.
149:28:10|T|CDR|Okay, fine.
149:28:11|T|LMP|The seat.
149:28:18|T|CDR|I think this bag here has got so little in it we can -
149:28:20|T|LMP|Let's empty it into the SRC; some more will go in the SRC.
149:28:23|T|CDR|Well, okay. But this has got those two whatchacallems there.
149:28:27|T|LMP|What you mean?
149:28:29|T|CDR|-
149:28:29|T|LMP|Oh, those - Yeah; okay. They can't go in the SRC.
149:28:32|T|CDR|Where do they go, in the ETB?
149:28:36|T|LMP|Ah, no; in a rock bag somewhere. Why don't you put them back here in mine, John. It's back on the Rover here.
149:28:44|T|CDR|Okay.
149:28:46|T|LMP|Back on the Rover.
149:28:59|T|CDR|There you go.
149:29:26|T|LMP|We're packing up the rock box, Tony.
149:29:29|C|Eng|Okay, good.
149:29:30|T|LMP|Got the rocks in it. The liner's coming off.
149:29:37|T|LMP|And I put the other core tubes in a - Tell you in a minute.
149:29:49|T|CDR|Beautiful, they just fit right in the top.
149:29:52|T|LMP|Good. What's the number on that one, John?
149:29:56|T|CDR|That's SCB-2. No. Yeah, 1.
149:30:14|C|Eng|Okay.
149:30:17|T|LMP|John, have you got - Where'd those two core tubes go that you had?
149:30:20|T|CDR|I put them in here. Four and forty-five are in your seat .
149:30:23|T|LMP|Oh, okay, then I got them already.
149:30:25|T|CDR|Okay.
149:30:30|T|LMP|Okay, my DAC goes -
149:30:32|T|CDR|Here, let me unload your backpack.
149:30:37|T|LMP|Okay.
149:30:38|T|CDR|My backpack's already been unloaded.
149:30:41|T|LMP|Okay.
149:30:44|T|CDR|We got two bags out that we -
149:30:45|T|LMP|Yeah, extra.
149:30:47|T|CDR|Well, good.
149:30:50|T|LMP|Okay, we're going to have three - I don't know how full mine is.
149:31:00|T|CDR|Okay, I got it.   -
149:31:15|T|LMP|Got it.
149:31:17|T|CDR|That's got it. Okay.
149:31:20|T|LMP|Okay.
149:31:21|T|CDR|It's hardly got any rocks in it at all.
149:31:22|T|LMP|I know. I think I can stuff them in this other bag over here, John.
149:31:26|T|CDR|Okay.
149:31:27|T|CDR|I'll take SCB-1 and put it by the footpad, Charlie.
149:31:32|T|LMP|Okay.  Yeah, I can stuff them in here .
149:31:36|T|CDR|Let me get these core tube caps out of here. Out of 1 and put them under the seat pan.  Okay.  I'll put them on the HTC, how would that be?
149:31:58|T|CDR|That's fine, that cap is empty.
149:32:18|T|LMP|No, we - It had two core tubes empty that we used. We used the bag, Tony, that's true -
149:32:27|T|CDR|- , Charlie.
149:32:28|T|LMP|Excuse me, John.  That was set -
149:32:29|T|CDR|
149:32:30|T|LMP|- for EVA-l - I mean EVA-3 -
149:32:40|C|Eng|There's no problem as long as you took those core tubes and core caps out.
149:32:46|T|LMP|We don't -
149:32:47|T|LMP|Well, we got the core caps out, but we didn't get the core tubes out and I don't know whether - We must have used them!
149:32:57|T|CDR|This here has a couple of core caps in it too, Charlie; in number 1.
149:33:00|T|LMP|How about core tubes?
149:33:02|T|CDR|; a couple of core tubes in number 1.
149:33:03|T|LMP|Oh, good, okay, we'll take those out.
149:33:05|T|CDR|Are they empty?
149:33:06|T|LMP|Yeah. They're empty. Okay, put them under my seat.
149:33:09|T|CDR|Sure they're empty?
149:33:10|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm positive, unless they got a cap on, they're empty. Okay, Tony, we found them.
149:33:15|C|Eng|Okay, good show.
149:33:23|T|LMP|Okay, SCB-3 is going to go up with us, the SRC is going to go up with us, and I'm packing the ETB now.
149:33:30|C|Eng|Okay.
149:33:31|T|CDR|And I'm going to put these two bags under your seat, Charlie.
149:33:34|T|LMP|Okay.
149:33:38|T|CDR|Now here's a - Something like that; that critter.
149:33:42|T|LMP|You can just leave those bags out, John.
149:33:45|T|CDR|Will the bags weather all right out here in the sunshine?
149:33:47|T|LMP|Oh, yeah.
149:33:49|C|Eng|Oh, I think they'll make it.
149:33:51|T|LMP|&quot;Two HEDCs with mags.&quot;
149:33:53|T|CDR|Okay.
149:33:58|T|LMP|Where's your camera, John? I need your camera.
149:34:01|T|CDR|Right here.  Okay.
149:34:09|T|LMP|Got it.
149:34:21|T|LMP|I've got it in my checklist, too; so -
149:34:29|T|CDR|Okay, now you're going to have to change that some because we got a little more than two HDCs, right?.
149:34:41|T|LMP|John, could you get those goodies in the left seat bag there - my bag - and pass them over.
149:34:49|T|CDR|Okay.
149:34:50|T|LMP|'Preciate it.
149:34:51|C|Eng|Okay, and verify you got those rocks in the bags that you tossed under the seat.
149:35:01|T|CDR|Yes, that's -
149:35:03|T|LMP|Let's see, there's one - No, there's one over there, I think, at the corner. That's - No, we got them all. Yeah, there it is.
149:35:10|T|LM Crew|That's it.
149:35:13|T|CDR|That's a glass ball that I found out there, Houston, I never said nothing about.
149:35:17|C|Eng|Good show. Let's bring that in.
149:35:23|T|CDR|I'll put that in the -  Might as well.
149:35:42|T|LMP|John, here's another piece of glass - piece of glass; hollow ball.
149:35:47|T|CDR|Yeah, let's put it in this here thing.
149:35:49|T|LMP|Okay.  Aw, rats!
149:35:56|T|CDR|Aw rats!
149:35:58|T|LMP|Those things just bounce out of your hand. It's like -  Okay, I got magazine Lima; the 500's going back under the seat. Might as well drop it in the dirt, as clean as that seat is. Okay, got to get the camera over there.
149:36:45|T|LMP|Okay.
149:36:46|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Okay, SCB number 1 is sitting over there on the foot strut, Charlie.
149:36:52|T|LMP|Okay; the mag's coming off the 16, battery's into the Sun -
149:37:04|C|Eng|Okay, we see that, Charlie.
149:37:07|T|LMP|- into the ETB.
149:37:09|T|CDR|Okay, do you want me to turn your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="alsj">LCRU power</a> off, Houston?
149:37:16|C|Eng|Okay -
149:37:17|T|CDR|do that. Say again.
149:37:22|C|Eng|Okay, point the camera lens directly away from the Sun and down first, and then you can turn the LCRU off. Also, when you get back to the LRV, we'd like the LRV readouts. We didn't catch those.  And we'll need LCRU blankets all the way over.
149:37:39|T|CDR|Okay, point the camera away from the Sun.  They're all the way open now.
149:37:45|T|CDR|Yeah, the camera directly down-Sun -
149:37:47|C|Eng|And down at the ground.
149:37:48|T|CDR|- and down, huh?
149:37:50|C|Eng|That's right.
149:37:51|T|CDR|- the stop.
149:37:55|T|CDR|Directly into the Sun?
149:38:00|T|CDR|Gotcha. There's the Sun, there's the camera, there's the down.
149:38:06|C|Eng|That looks good.
149:38:08|T|LMP|How did that old nursery rhyme go? Oh, I know. &quot;Here's the church - &quot;
149:38:18|T|LMP|You know what you sounded like then?
149:38:20|T|CDR|What?
149:38:21|T|LMP|That old nursery rhyme. &quot;This is the church, this is the steeple, open the door, and here are the people.&quot;  Okay, two padded bags, we're just going to leave. One set maps, we got; one mag from DAC; one mag. Okay, it's all loaded. Padded bags are staying under the seat, Houston.
149:38:37|C|Eng|Okay.
149:38:42|T|LMP|Okay, and the ETB's coming over and I'm going to hook it on the -
149:38:55|T|CDR|And the batteries do need dusting.
149:38:59|C|Eng|All right, we saw it come off those covers .
149:39:00|T|LMP|Do you want me to do that, John? I can reach better.
149:39:02|T|CDR|I can get it.  Those LCRUs, yeah.
149:39:10|T|LMP|Man, we got a lot of rocks.
149:39:12|C|Eng|Good show.
149:39:14|T|CDR|Only way to fly, Charlie.
149:39:15|C|Eng|The name of the game.
149:39:16|T|LMP|And we don't have Big Muley yet.  Don't let us forget to get Big Muley here.
149:39:22|C|Eng|Oh, we wouldn't do that.
149:39:23|T|LMP|That beauty's coming in, if I have to sleep with it.  Okay, I'm going to get Pallet 2 out;  with enough food for the Trojan army.
149:39:43|T|CDR|Charlie.
149:39:47|T|LMP|Agh! Oh, look at that, John. It just comes right out of there; and I had so much trouble in training.  Okay, &quot;pallet 2, MESA, LiOH can, MESA&quot;. Hmmm.  Do we have that, Tony?
149:40:12|C|Eng|You already have the LiOH can up there.
149:40:17|T|LMP|We already got it up there, don't we?
149:40:19|C|Eng|That's right.
149:40:20|T|LMP|Yeah, that went up yesterday, so - Okay, then we won't worry about that.
149:40:28|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, as you know, the one I have the most trouble getting is that mirror in the middle which I understand is just the Nav system anyway. But I got it as best I could and it's a lot cleaner than it was.
149:40:38|C|Eng|Okay, understand.
149:40:39|T|CDR|Both of the Rover battery mirrors are as good as they were when we got here.
149:40:45|C|Eng|Okay.
149:40:46|T|LMP|This one needs dusting, John.
149:40:47|T|CDR|I know. I ain't dusted it yet.
149:40:48|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going over and kick off on the strut here.
149:41:00|T|LMP|Boy, that shadow is getting short!
149:41:02|T|CDR|Maybe we landed later than we thought, Charlie.
149:41:06|C|Eng|Okay; and it 's 7 hours right now.
149:41:13|T|CDR|Okay.
149:41:19|T|LMP|This is the best way to get the dust off, John, is kick against the strut. Look at that stuff go.
149:41:24|T|CDR|Yeah, but I - Wait a minute, don't go anywhere yet.
149:41:27|T|LMP|I'm not.  Pat your hands, kick your feet.  Okay, two SCBs, we got. Looks like we're going to have everything. Pallet to Ascent Stage, two SCBs to Ascent Stage.  Okay, John, I'm gonna take one of these up to the Ascent Stage.
149:42:13|T|CDR|Okay. Careful now, you're about to kick the other - Oh -
149:42:17|T|LMP|Oh, rats! Did kick it open.
149:42:21|T|CDR|Wait a minute. Move, Charlie. Let me get it. Okay?
149:42:24|T|LMP|Okay, I'm sorry.
149:42:27|T|CDR|It's not a question of -  Where's that sample that was in it.
149:42:38|T|LMP|There you go.  The top just wasn't too closed.
149:42:47|T|CDR|Yeah.
149:42:48|T|LMP|Okay, I got the bag.
149:42:50|T|CDR|No, wait a minute. What'd I do with the sample? There it goes.
149:42:53|T|LMP|Another sample.  The thing's not designed to fit in there, John.
149:43:15|T|CDR|It goes in there.
149:43:17|T|LMP|Not flat like that, I bet you.
149:43:19|T|CDR|Certainly does. I put it in there a minute ago.  No.
149:43:38|T|LMP|Got it!
149:43:39|T|CDR|I figured it would really be good because we'd keep the top closed.
149:43:44|T|LMP|And the way to close these things is bang on them. There you go. Okay, that's good. Okay, I'm gonna just go up and take one of them up, John, and then I was going to come back down. I'm not going inside.
149:43:56|T|CDR|Okay.
149:43:59|T|LMP|You want to take the brush?
149:44:00|T|CDR|Yeah.
149:44:03|T|LMP|Here you go.
149:44:06|T|CDR|Charlie, why don't you let me get them. Let me clean you off, you go up in there, hook on, and let me just carry those things upstairs.
149:44:12|T|LMP|Hook on to what?
149:44:14|T|CDR|Hook on to the upstairs.
149:44:17|T|LMP|I'm not going to hook on to anything up there. I'm going to stand there and wait on you.
149:44:20|T|CDR|That's what I mean. Go on up there and let me just bring them all up.
149:44:25|T|LMP|You've got four things to bring up.
149:44:27|T|CDR|No problem.
149:44:28|T|LMP|But you want to - Whatever you want to do.  Okay, let me pull my visor down.  I can't believe it. Tony, do we look as dirty to y'all as we do to each other?
149:44:57|C|Eng|Nah! You just look pristine!
149:45:05|T|LMP|Okay.
149:45:08|T|CDR|Well, we've got two hours, and I got the feeling we're going to stand up tonight cleaning each other off.
149:45:58|T|LMP|That's good enough, John. Clean off my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a>. That's the only other thing I wanted. Can you clean the top of it off?  There we go.  Let me get you.
149:46:31|T|CDR|Wait until you find out that these rocks have a specific gravity of 1.0 .
149:46:39|T|LMP|Somebody's in trouble .  John, I'm not sure we're doing much good.
149:46:51|T|CDR|I agree with you. But, really, don't forget to kick your feeties .
149:46:54|T|LMP|I know it. Okay, turn around.
149:46:59|T|CDR|Mainly on the back of the PLSS and the helmet, and that kind of stuff, because we
149:47:04|T|LMP|Yeah, okay.
149:47:04|C|Eng|- verify your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj">PLSS antennas</a> are down.
149:47:10|T|CDR|Good thought, but they're not.
149:47:11|T|LMP|Not yet.
149:47:13|T|LMP|Okay, that's knocking it off, John.
149:47:17|T|CDR|Now wait now. Don't; don't, Charlie.
149:47:20|T|LMP|I wouldn't hit you hard.
149:47:22|T|CDR|Listen, I don't -  Nobody's ever tried that on a pressure suit.
149:47:28|T|LMP|That was with the - Dealie came loose here.
149:47:32|T|CDR|He's just knocking me in the head, Houston, in case you're wondering what's going on.
149:47:37|T|LMP|Got it off, though, you got to admit.
149:47:39|T|CDR|Get the dirt off.  knocks your visor loose.
149:47:43|T|LMP|Okay, let me see down here.
149:47:44|C|Eng|Okay, you're getting pretty far behind now. We're gonna have to ask you to go on in.
149:47:50|T|LMP|Okay, I'm going up right now.
149:47:52|T|CDR|Charlie's going in right now.
149:47:54|C|Eng|Okay.
149:47:55|T|LMP|We were just dusting off. We're pretty dusty. Can you hand me the pallet when you jump up , John?
149:48:00|T|CDR|Yeah. Wait. Okay, I sure will. I got to put this on the LCRU .
149:48:04|T|LMP|Okay.
149:48:06|C|Eng|From the nominal timeline, you're down about 30 minutes now.
149:48:15|T|LMP|Yeah, well, we'll get in right in a hurry.
149:48:18|C|Eng|Okay, fine. And as you walk past that MESA, make sure the blankets are down. We are seeing a temperature rise.
149:48:28|T|CDR|The blankets are down on the MESA.
149:48:31|T|LMP|They are down.
149:48:32|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
149:48:35|T|LMP|How can you see - I didn't know you had any thermometers down there .
149:48:45|T|LMP|John, could you -
149:48:46|C|Eng|And we would like those Rover readouts before you pull those circuit breakers, John.
149:48:52|T|CDR|You want the pallet, right?
149:48:53|T|LMP|Yeah. Tony, the MESA's partially in the Sun, and that's probably the reason.
149:49:00|C|Eng|Ah so.
149:49:01|T|LMP|In fact, the - Got it.
149:49:05|T|CDR|Make it?
149:49:06|T|LMP|Uh-huh.  Okay, ol' -
149:49:13|T|CDR|If you want, I'll take these smaller blankets and put over the top of it, Houston.
149:49:27|C|Eng|We'd like you to just get on in.
149:49:32|T|CDR|Okay.  How you coming, Charlie?
149:49:42|T|LMP|I'm up on the porch.
149:49:43|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, you want to Reset the UV camera?
149:49:47|C|Eng|Yep. We got a setting.
149:49:52|T|CDR|Okay.
149:49:53|C|Eng|Okay, it's azimuth, 100; and elevation, 77.
149:50:01|T|CDR|Okay. Going to Reset. That wheel's moved more than 180?
149:50:12|C|Eng|That may look pretty close to the LM, but we'll just take it the way it is.
149:50:19|T|CDR|Okay.
149:50:30|T|LMP|It's going to be pointing right at the LM, Houston!
149:50:32|C|Eng|Elevation is 77.
149:50:34|T|CDR|All right. Maybe it'll be over the top of it.  Okay. Azimuth, 100; elevation, 77.
149:50:55|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, I'm inside.
149:50:57|C|Eng|Okay.
149:51:00|T|CDR|Standing up, Charlie?
149:51:01|T|LMP|Yeah. And I got about a ton of dirt from somewhere.
149:51:10|T|CDR|Okay, elevation, 100 -  Azimuth, 100; elevation, 77, set and pointed. It misses the LM okay. That's straight overhead.
149:51:19|C|Eng|Okay. Good show. You're looking at the geo-corona.
149:51:25|T|CDR|Oh, the geo-corona. Hopefully.  Charlie, are you standing up?
149:51:44|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm standing up.
149:51:46|T|CDR|You ready for a rock box?
149:51:48|T|LMP|Uh - Yeah. I'd like to get this pallet . You can start on up.
149:52:02|T|CDR|Okay.
149:52:09|C|Eng|And, John, have you closed the circuit breakers on the LRV?
149:52:15|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
149:52:16|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
149:52:26|T|CDR|What happens to it if you don't pull those breakers?  run off somewhere?  Okay, Charlie.
149:53:07|T|CDR|Uh-uh, Charlie.
149:53:08|T|LMP|What?
149:53:11|T|CDR|You're too near the camera to be slinging stuff out there.
149:53:13|T|LMP|Oh, I'm sorry. It's just that one little old dinky thing. That's all I was going to do.
149:53:15|T|CDR|Okay.
149:53:16|T|LMP|Okay, here comes the pallet to you.
149:53:25|T|CDR|Okay.
149:53:26|T|LMP|Got it?
149:53:27|T|CDR|Yeah.
149:53:28|T|LMP|Okay.
149:53:35|T|CDR|I'm going to throw it by the -
149:53:39|T|LMP|Okay, babe, you got two SCBs and an ETB to come up. You could probably load the -
149:53:45|T|CDR|There the SRC right there, Charlie.
149:53:47|T|LMP|I know it. Well, you still got two ETBs .
149:53:50|T|CDR|Two ETBs?
149:53:52|T|LMP|Yeah. I mean one ETB and the -  The two SCBs.
149:54:05|T|CDR|Right.
149:54:17|T|CDR|Okay, here you go, Charlie.
149:54:20|T|LMP|Pass her in.  Okay.  I should have unhooked it. I got it.
149:54:31|T|CDR|You want me to unhook it?
149:54:32|T|LMP|Well, I got it now.
149:54:33|T|CDR|Okay, don't lock the hook. Just unhook it.
149:54:36|T|LMP|I'm not. It's alright.  Okay, there it comes.
149:54:53|T|CDR|Okay, I got the hook.
149:54:57|T|LMP|Okay, two SCBs and we got it.
149:54:58|C|Eng|Okay, John -  Charlie. Sounds good.
149:55:09|T|LMP|John, you're not going to believe the dirt on this floor.
149:55:11|T|CDR|Yeah, I am.
149:55:52|T|LMP|What are you doing?
149:55:54|T|CDR|Oh, I'm trying to set something up here.
149:55:59|T|LMP|Okay.
149:56:38|T|CDR|Did you throw something out of there?
149:56:40|T|LMP|No.
149:56:41|T|CDR|You didn't?
149:56:42|T|LMP|No.   Maybe we've got visitors.
149:57:30|T|LMP|I got it.
149:57:31|T|CDR|Got it?
149:57:32|T|LMP|Yeah.
149:57:33|T|CDR|Okay.
149:57:34|T|LMP|Yeah. How do you read, Houston?
149:57:37|C|Eng|We're copying you, Charlie.
149:57:42|T|LMP|Okay. I just heard a little squeal back there I was curious.
149:57:48|C|Eng|All right. We had a hand-off.
149:57:53|T|CDR|Ah so.
149:58:01|T|LMP|These bags come open - The SCBs come open when you don't want them to and you can't get them open when you want them to.
149:58:11|C|Eng|Okay. We'll call that Charlie's Law.
149:58:16|T|LMP|Yeah.
149:58:21|T|LMP|Okay, John, I can't get it - Can you slide it.
149:58:27|T|LMP|You okay?

149:58:37|T|LMP|Okay, now let me get behind the hatch.
149:58:38|T|CDR|Okay.
149:58:51|C|Eng|Charlie, what's John doing right now?
149:58:57|T|LMP|He's on the porch waiting -
149:58:58|T|CDR|Sitting on the porch waiting for Charlie to move out of the way.
149:59:01|C|Eng|Okay.
149:59:05|T|LMP|Okay. Come on, John. Here we go.  Okay, you've got to come right, John. You reading me okay?

149:59:50|T|LMP|Yeah, it is. Look it - Can you get back - Your legs - There we go. Okay. PLSS - Okay, wait a minute.
149:59:59|T|CDR|- are open, Charlie.
150:00:01|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay, we shouldn't have closed that hatch all the way. We've got our water still on.
150:00:05|T|CDR|That's what I said.
150:00:06|T|LMP|I'm sorry.
150:00:08|T|CDR|Just a second and I'll get it.  There we go.
150:00:13|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay. I'll turn your water off.
150:00:17|T|CDR|Okay.
150:00:24|T|LMP|Well, I can't reach it. Oh, there you go. You were caught on the -
150:00:31|T|CDR|On that thing.
150:00:33|T|LMP|Yeah, on that bracket. Okay, there you go.
150:00:34|T|CDR|Okay.
150:00:35|T|LMP|Okay.
150:00:38|T|CDR|Turn sideways?
150:00:39|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, go ahead.
150:00:58|T|CDR|Okay, your water is off.
150:00:59|T|LMP|Okay. Read the next step. Close hatch, I think.

150:01:34|T|CDR|It's locked.
150:01:25|T|LMP|Okay, I think the Cabin Repress is next. Okay, and let me read the next step.
150:01:28|T|CDR|Okay.
150:01:33|T|LMP|&quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../DumpValve.html" target="alsj">Dump valve</a> goes to Auto.&quot;
150:01:35|T|CDR|Okay. This valve goes open -
150:01:36|T|LMP|- going on.
150:01:38|T|CDR|Okay. I believe I've got a water flag.
150:01:41|T|LMP|Okay.
150:01:45|T|CDR|It's probably because we turned the water off.
150:01:47|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

150:02:02|T|LMP|Okay. I've got a water flag, too.
150:02:06|T|CDR|I've got a water flag and an O flag. Cabin press is up to 1.
150:02:11|T|LMP|Houston, we're repressing.
150:02:12|C|Eng|Okay, we see it.
150:02:15|T|CDR|Verify <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_press_reg_a_b.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Press Regulators A and B</a> coming to Cabin, Charlie.

150:02:31|T|LMP|Okay.
150:02:33|T|CDR|Okay, Mark.
150:02:34|T|LMP|Okay, I'll get yours.  I think. There it is. Yours is off.
150:02:49|T|CDR|I think yours is off. Let me try it again.
150:02:56|T|CDR|alarm is off.
150:02:57|T|LMP|Good.
150:02:59|T|CDR|- is off.
150:03:00|T|LMP|I've got a press flag.
150:03:03|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;Cabin warning light off. Verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5.&quot;
150:03:10|T|LMP|It's there. Yeah, it is. It's there.
150:03:13|T|CDR|Looks like 4.6. What a contraption!
150:03:15|T|LMP|Isn't that amazing?
150:03:16|T|CDR|That's something else.
150:03:17|C|Eng|Okay. You guys had a 7-hour 23-minute EVA.
150:03:23|T|CDR|Beautiful.
150:03:26|T|LMP|That's super! That's a lot of fun. Let's go back out.
150:03:31|C|Eng|Tomorrow, Charlie, tomorrow.
150:03:36|T|LMP|I mean it. I feel great.
150:03:39|T|LMP|PLSS O2 Off?
150:03:40|T|CDR|PLSS O2 off and - Okay, &quot;Cabin warning light on. Verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5. Use purge valve to depress PGA as req'd &quot;.
150:03:50|T|LMP|Mine's already depressed.
150:03:58|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;verify the EVA CBs&quot;.
150:04:02|T|CDR|Yep.
150:04:03|T|LMP|I got Suit Fan 2 and Suit Fan Delta-P going in .
150:04:08|T|CDR|Now where do you see that one? Okay, Suit Fan 2 and Suit Fan Delta -
150:04:11|T|LMP|That's right after -
150:04:12|T|CDR|Okay, power-saving circuit breakers are out, and the old others are out.
150:04:22|T|LMP|Okay?
150:04:24|T|CDR|Why do those circuit breakers go in and out on you like that?
150:04:28|T|LMP|I don't know.  Why do we do that every time .
150:04:34|T|CDR|Okay, it says &quot;ECS caution and water SEP lights out&quot;. That's true. &quot;Suit Fan Delta-P, close. Doff gloves, stow on comm panel.&quot;
150:04:43|T|LMP|Okay!  Must admit my finger's a little tired, though. Just a skosh. Could you turn up your A-9 numerics lighting when you get a chance, John? Let's look at the caution panel. Okay. That's good. We're in good shape.
150:05:53|T|LMP|Okay. My gloves are off. You need some help? You got yours, huh?
150:05:56|T|CDR|Yep.
150:06:07|T|CDR|Let me see.  Well -  Okay.  Okay; It's cool as a cucumber.  Thanks for your thermal-dynamicist's advice.
150:06:43|C|Eng|So much for a thermal analysis.
150:06:47|T|CDR|Yeah.  It's about 72 degrees F on the top of that thing.
150:06:52|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
150:06:56|T|CDR|It's hard working from absolute zero.
150:07:02|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;Descent Water's Open. Remove - &quot; We're right here.
150:07:07|T|CDR|Yeah.

150:07:15|T|LMP|I'm not either.  That was fun.
150:07:27|T|CDR|Sure was, Charlie.
150:07:28|T|LMP|Go.
150:07:30|T|CDR|Okay.
150:07:31|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;disconnect OPS O2 hose&quot;. Turn around and I'll get yours.
150:07:36|T|CDR|Okay, I got yours.  -
150:07:55|T|LMP|The outboard one, huh?. Okay, yours is loose.
150:07:59|T|CDR|Okay.
150:08:01|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;disconnect LM O2 hoses, red to blue and blue to red; PGA , horizontal. Suit Flow; PLSS Pump, Off; and Fan, Off.&quot;  Wrong switch. Okay, that's.  We don't - We'll bypass that.
150:08:19|T|CDR|Okay.
150:08:20|T|LMP|I go to Suit Flow in the -
150:08:27|T|CDR|We're supposed to have stowed these in there.  We missed a step.
150:08:30|T|LMP|Wait, wait, wait - Oh, yeah, we did. Not that one. We sure do. I was thinking about EVA-3. Okay.
150:08:45|T|CDR|Thank you.
150:09:18|T|LMP|Houston, the lunar dust smells like gunpowder.
150:09:27|C|Eng|We copy that, Charlie.
150:09:31|T|LMP|Really, really a strong odor to it.
150:09:36|C|Eng|Yeah, remember on hammering on rocks, fresh rock powder does have a strong odor.
150:09:47|T|LMP|I hope it's not the oxygen that has the peculiar odor. But it goes away after a little while but -
150:09:53|T|CDR|Well, you can bet this Moon has been hammered on. That's for sure.
150:09:58|T|LMP|But it is really a strong smell.
150:10:03|T|CDR|Boy, I'll tell you.
150:10:06|C|Eng|Okay, and we need a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return Valve</a>, Open.
150:10:11|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
150:10:16|T|LMP|Okay. Right now, we're in a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter </a> Pull-Egress; Cabin Gas Return is Open; and my Flow is On and John's is in Disconnect. Do you want us to go to Push-Cabin?
150:10:33|C|Eng|That's affirmative. Push-Cabin.
150:10:37|T|LMP|Okay. You got it. Feels nice and cool. Sorry about that step, John.
150:10:48|T|CDR|Well, it's my fault.
150:10:51|T|LMP|Okay, we got this, we got that, -
150:10:54|T|CDR|-
150:10:57|T|LMP|You're cutting out now. &quot;Disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA; connect LM.&quot;
150:11:04|T|CDR|There you go.
150:11:05|T|LMP|That sounds like a good deal.
150:11:06|T|CDR|Now that's just one step right there.
150:11:08|T|LMP|The trouble is, yours is back under the rock box right now.  There you go.
150:11:17|T|LMP|Ah, that was great fun.  Never seen anybody sneak as nice.
150:11:35|T|CDR|
150:11:37|T|LMP|I don't think you got anything on that Beta-cloth one.
150:11:40|T|CDR|Yeah, I'll tell you. That's a problem you have to face with it . You know you don't set it down very hard.
150:11:47|T|LMP|Have you got yours hooked up yet? Your water?
150:11:50|T|CDR|Yep.
150:11:51|T|LMP|Okay, I gave us some water .
150:11:52|T|CDR|Okay.  &quot;PLSS mode, 0, both; and Audio CB, Open.&quot;
150:12:00|T|LMP|Okay, did you get your pump Off ? Your fan and pump.
150:12:02|T|CDR|-
150:12:59|T|LMP|Okay. Audio, Close.
150:13:02|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie.
150:13:05|T|LMP|Ready for the audio check?
150:13:35|T|LMP|Okay. Call them out to me.
150:13:41|T|CDR|Okay. A to Receive; B to Off; Mode, ICS/PTT
150:14:31|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read? Over.
150:14:34|C|Eng|Five by, Charlie.
150:14:38|T|LMP|Okay. Thank you.
150:22:57|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
150:23:01|C|Mit|Go ahead.
150:23:05|T|LMP|Okay. My initial O2 recharge's complete and I got 95 percent.
150:23:17|C|Mit|Roger; 95, Charlie.
150:23:27|T|LMP|Ed, how are you doing today?
150:23:30|C|Mit|Pretty good, Charlie. And it went real great.  We're real pleased down here.
150:23:38|T|LMP|We're happy as a clam. We just had a great time, having fun as well as the work.
150:24:12|T|CDR|You know, Ed, when we got up on top of that mountain and I'd been driving up it all the way, and I turned around and looked down, I thought, man, you've just nearly bit off more than you can chew here.
150:24:24|C|Mit|Trying to cut through. You've got a lot of hash and I couldn't read you very well.
150:24:31|T|CDR|Just as well.
150:24:36|T|LMP|That's his beard sticking in the mike.
150:24:45|C|Mit|Well, maybe you're starting late, but you'll catch up in 3 or 4 months with a beard.
150:24:53|T|LMP|Don't rub it in.
150:25:09|T|LMP|Hey, Ed, how about a little news from you. Anything going on down there that's interesting?
150:25:16|C|Mit|Is that news you're asking for, Charlie?
150:25:21|T|LMP|Yes, sir.
150:25:22|C|Mit|Okay. Stand by. We'll see if we can get you something.
150:27:53|T|CDR|- 4 Okay, Houston - about 92 percent - 92 - 92 -  Houston, do you read? Over.
150:31:11|C|Mit|Orion, Houston.
150:31:17|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
150:31:20|C|Mit|Okay. We're running down some news reports for you right now. And we're not pushing, John, but we would like to stay fairly close to timeline so you can get plenty of sleep tonight. You're going to have a hard day tomorrow.
150:31:36|T|CDR|Wait a minute, they said we had 2 hours extra tonight where we could just sit around and talk to each other.
150:31:43|C|Mit|Okay, the boss just said he wasn't really sure he wanted to do all that talking tonight.
150:31:52|T|CDR|Neither do we. We were going to use it to sleep with. Or at least take it easy on fixing things up.
150:32:01|C|Mit|John, I'm sorry; you're in the hash again. I missed that last.
150:32:10|T|LMP|He said we're gonna use it for sleeping, Ed.
150:32:12|C|Mit|Great. Just what we wanted.
150:33:28|T|LMP|Okay, Ed; my OPS source pressure is 6100 and John's is 5900. Over.
150:33:38|C|Mit|Read you.
150:33:56|T|CDR|Houston, we've finished the initial PLSS recharge. Charlie had 95 and I had 92. Over.
150:34:07|C|Mit|Roger, John. Say again your percentage.
150:34:10|T|CDR|Houston - 92 percent.
150:34:16|C|Mit|We copy, John.
150:42:52|C|Mit|Orion; Houston.
150:42:58|T|LMP|Go ahead, Ed.
150:42:59|C|Mit|Well, if you're in a position to where you want to listen, I've got a little sports news for you. If you'd like to hold off, let me know when .
150:43:10|T|LMP|Oh, go ahead. We'll listen, Ed. We're just changing out the batteries and stuff for the PLSS .
150:43:20|C|Mit|Okay. Right now, we've got New York won 3 to 1 over the Celtics in their series. The Lakers have finished up theirs, 4 to 2 over Milwaukee . And are standing by to see the outcome of the rest of the New York and Celtics games. And the Astros have finished up 4 in a row today.
150:43:46|T|LMP|Won or lost?
150:43:50|C|Mit|Now that wasn't a kind question. Won, of course.
150:43:55|T|LMP|Super. Great.
150:43:57|T|CDR|There goes Charlie's tickets.
150:44:01|C|Mit|We'll run some more news down here before long.  And when you get your battery management , I'll give you the new procedure, Charlie; just give me a call.
150:44:18|T|LMP|Okay; stand by.
150:58:19|C|Mit|Orion; Houston. Would you give us a clue as to where you are in the checklist?
150:58:27|T|LMP|Okay, we just finished changing out my LiOH and we're stowing the PLSS O2 and the OPS is removed.
150:58:34|C|Mit|Okay.
150:59:28|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
150:59:29|C|Mit|Go ahead.
150:59:48|C|Mit|How much, Charlie?
150:59:52|T|LMP|About 2 inches. And I checked the comm when I noticed it. When he came in, I checked the comm and he was still sounding the same to me.
151:00:06|C|Mit|Okay, he sounds good to us. Do you happen to know when it occurred? Or when you first saw it?
151:00:15|T|LMP|Well, I think it was during the ingress. We got behind and y'all reminded us of it once , but we were still working and we didn't do it at that point. When we started dusting, Tony said get on in, and so we forgot it. I got in and then when I saw John coming up the ladder, it was gone then.
151:00:38|C|Mit|Okay, so we're missing a couple inches of antenna. Understand.
151:01:57|T|LMP|Okay, Ed, we're ready for the battery management .
151:01:59|C|Mit|Okay, Charlie, I'll give you the overall plan here to put the Lunar Batt on the LMP Bus, take Batts 1 and 2, Off, and Batts 3 and 4, On, and I'll give you the details if you feel like you want them.
151:02:14|T|LMP|Oh, no. We got that. No problem.
151:02:16|C|Mit|Okay.
151:02:34|T|LMP|Okay, that's done, Ed. We got Batts 1 and 2; Off, 3 and 4 are on; and Luny Batt is on the LMP Bus.
151:02:44|C|Mit|Okay, Charlie.
151:03:34|T|LMP|Okay, Ed, I don't see the Luny Batt carrying much of a load here. Is TELMU satisfied?
151:03:47|C|Mit|Stand by, Charlie. We're observing that.  You're Go.
151:03:53|T|LMP|Okay.
151:07:57|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
151:08:02|C|Mit|Go ahead, Charlie.
151:08:06|T|LMP|Okay, Ed. I got some weights for you . You ready to copy?
151:08:09|C|Mit|Stand by one.
151:08:10|T|LMP|The SRC number 2 -  Okay.
151:08:18|C|Mit|Go ahead.
151:08:23|T|LMP|Okay, the SRC number 2 weighs 41 pounds . SCB-3, which is in sample containment bag number 3, weighs 30 pounds . SCB-1, which is in sample containment bag number 4, weighs 26 pounds . Over.
151:08:46|C|Mit|Okay, SRC 2 is 41 pounds. SCB number 3, which is the containment bag 3, is 30 pounds. SCB number 1, which is in containment bag 4, is 26 pounds.
151:09:01|T|CDR|That's Charlie's.
151:17:38|C|Mit|Okeydoke.
151:22:50|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
151:22:59|C|Mit|Go ahead, Orion.
151:23:04|T|LMP|I gather Doc's worked on a metabolic assessment for us. Would you let us know in a little while?
151:23:11|C|Mit|Charlie, come at me again on that, please.
151:23:17|T|LMP|Roger. We're just curious the metabolic rates today. Could you have the Doc work on that for us, and let us know in a little while.
151:23:24|C|Mit|Yeah. I got it, Charlie. On John, the average ran about 785 average; and the LMP, on you, Charlie, ran about 870.
151:23:40|T|LMP|Okay. John, 785, and me, 870. Thank you.
151:23:46|C|Mit|Yeah, we had predicted, on both of you, 890, so running to the good there .
151:23:54|T|LMP|That's great. Thank you.
151:24:36|C|Mit|And, Orion, the Docs tell me you were running about an 88 average heartbeat today.
151:24:45|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, thank you. Is that both of us?
151:24:51|C|Mit|That's affirm. Both of you.
151:38:33|T|CDR|Hello, Houston; Orion. How do you read?
151:38:40|C|Mit|Orion, Houston; did you call?
151:38:44|T|CDR|That's affirmative. I'm out of my suit, and Charlie's getting out of his suit now.
151:38:55|C|Mit|Fine. I understand that John's out of his suit and Charlie's coming out now, is that correct?
151:39:04|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
151:39:06|C|Mit|Okay.
151:47:01|C|Mit|Orion, Houston.
151:47:06|T|CDR|Go ahead, Houston.
151:47:08|C|Mit|Rog. Ken's passing overhead right now. Could you give him a call and verify that he's on left VHF antenna. We're not receiving the VHF downlink on the bistatic radar.  And come up on Transmitter A - Simplex - - .
151:47:54|T|CDR|Hey, Ken. How do you receive? Over.
151:48:03|T|CDR|Ken, this is Orion. How do you read? Over.
151:48:09|T|CDR|Hey, Casper, this is Orion. Houston, you said VHF A to Transmit, B to Receive, right?
151:48:20|C|Mit|That's correct, Orion.
151:48:23|T|CDR|Okay, I'm not reading anything.  Houston, what do you want me to tell him, again?
151:48:42|C|Mit|To verify he's on the -
151:48:43|T|CDR|Okay.
151:48:44|C|Mit|- VHF left antenna.
151:48:48|T|CDR|Roger.
151:48:53|T|CDR|Casper, this is Orion. Over.
151:49:01|T|CDR|Casper, this is Orion. Over.
151:49:09|T|CDR|Casper, this is Orion transmitting in the blind. Houston wants to verify that you are on the left antenna. They are not receiving VHF. Over.
151:49:40|T|CDR|Is he overhead yet, Ed?
151:49:45|C|Mit|That's affirm. He's just about directly overhead. We kind of suspect he's off the headset since he is maintaining radio silence this pass for the bistatic .
151:49:55|T|CDR|I'm sure he is.
151:50:20|C|Mit|Okay, Orion; Houston. Thank you very much - that's enough - giving it a try and reconfigure your VHF back to a nominal configuration.
151:50:31|T|CDR|Okay, we'll do it. Sorry we couldn't raise him. But I believe he's off the headset. If he was told to maintain radio silence, he don't hear. You know Ken.
151:50:41|C|Mit|We're all convinced you're right, John. Thank you.
151:51:35|T|CDR|Okay. Charlie's almost out of his suit now.
151:51:40|C|Mit|Good show.
151:51:45|T|CDR|You know, Houston, it would sure be handy to have something like a false floor to lay down in this thing, because we sure can't stand on the floor right now .
151:51:56|C|Mit|You'd like a bath mat, eh, Charlie?
151:51:58|T|CDR|Do what? Say again.
152:06:47|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're ready for the lift-off times for revs 40 to 45.  And the EVA debriefing.
152:07:02|C|Eng|Okay, John. We're ready to go when you're ready.
152:07:27|T|CDR|Okay, you can give me the revs 40 to 45 until Charlie gets on comm. Over.
152:07:36|C|Eng|Okay. We've got T-41, 154 plus 02 plus 12; T-42, 156 plus 00 plus 41; T-43, 157 plus 59 plus 13; T-44, 159 plus 57 plus 44; T-45, 161 plus 56 plus 16; and that's it.
152:08:28|T|CDR|41, 154:02:12; then 156:00 plus 41; 157 plus 59 plus 13; 159 plus 57 plus 44; 161 plus 56 plus 16.
152:08:48|C|Eng|Okay, good readback.
152:08:53|T|CDR|What ground-elapsed time do you have now, Tony?
152:08:59|C|Eng|Say again, John.  Okay, your GET is 152 plus 20.
152:09:07|T|CDR|152 plus 20?
152:09:11|C|Eng|Right, and I can give you some times in your Surface Checklist for the different periods if you want them.
152:09:18|T|CDR|Yeah, I would appreciate that. We don't have any idea what time it is. Not that it makes any difference.  Charlie says it's 8 o'clock here.
152:09:37|C|Eng|Okay, John, I didn't catch that. Do you want these times for page 5-5?
152:09:46|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
152:09:56|C|Eng|Okay. On page 5-5. The EVA debriefing should start at 151 plus 55. Eat period, 152 plus 10. PLSS O2 and H2O recharge, 152 plus 55. Okay, on 5-6, the midcourse conference - or MCC conference, correction - is 153 plus 25. Pre-sleep is 154 plus 10. And rest period begins at 154 plus 35. That's on the bottom of 5-7, and that goes for 8 hours.
152:10:47|T|CDR|Okay, say again when the rest period - Where it goes.
152:10:52|C|Eng|Okay, the rest period at the bottom of 5-7 is 154 plus 35 and it's for 8 hours. And we're gonna try to get you to bed even early.
152:11:08|T|CDR|There you go.
152:11:15|T|LMP|Tony, you can't believe how dirty it is in this lunar module.
152:11:22|C|Eng|Okay, a couple of bits of information we'd like from you before we start the debriefing. We'd like to know if you drank all of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="alsj">in-suit drink</a>?
152:11:35|T|CDR|Every drop. Both of us.
152:11:37|C|Eng|Good show. Did you drink any water when you got back in -
152:11:39|T|CDR|
152:11:40|C|Eng|- and can you estimate how much?
152:11:46|T|CDR|What?  Yeah, we had a lot! There's no way to tell it unless you keep count of the swallows and we didn't do that - .
152:12:01|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. And we'd like to remind you that you have some ointment in your medical kit if your fingers are sore there. And just to make you feel warm, the next hand-off, we go to the 210-foot dish and we'll have High Bit Rate and Data for all your entire sleep period.
152:12:22|T|LMP|Yippee!
152:12:24|C|Eng|Okay. When you're ready, we'd like to go on with -
152:12:29|T|LMP|Tony -
152:12:38|T|LMP|Okay. On the water, we were reconsidering the dosage. It went down like a cool one after a geology trip, if you know what I mean. There was about the same amount .
152:12:54|C|Eng|Okay.
152:13:04|T|LMP|Go ahead. We're all ears.
152:13:07|C|Eng|Okay. Discussing Station 4 here, we'd like your general impression of the rocks. Especially the bigger blocks. You described mostly breccias and white crystalline rocks. Were there any others; and could you just talk about them a little bit?
152:13:33|T|CDR|Well, if we'd seen any that we recognized, we'd have told you about it. I think the big blocks were just big brothers to the littler blocks. That secondary that we were working up there was a classic. It really was. And the pan will show that. Must have come from South Ray. It had a great block land in the middle, and then the fractures - ran off into all kinds of little blocks.
152:14:04|T|CDR|I think that's about the only rock that we saw. You know, we're not really sure. It's our first guess as to what those rocks are up there: whether they're breccias or crystalline rocks. I'm sure you all know that. But most of them were very dust covered. I only saw one clear crystalline in the whole EVA - except for the ones I chipped away - and that was the one I picked up. I think it was Station 5, or 6.
152:14:54|T|LMP|I think, Tony, my view is the same. We had only a predominance of South Ray ejecta all around. Mostly some of the smaller rakes were given to Descartes. It just occurred to me that everywhere we were, there was a boulder field of varying sizes and intensity and you could see eruptive force - you could look back at South Ray - and you could see the rays coming our way and spreading and fanning out as they flow.
152:15:34|T|CDR|You know, it just may be that that South Ray Crater is so recent it's mantled everything - or most everything - around here. You know, like we said about the rays at South Ray, some were white and some were black rays and just a little layer of dust. I didn't see hardly a clear surface all day long. I felt right at home like we were back in the United States studying geology and everybody said the rocks would be crystal clear. Well, here it's all covered up. And it is my opinion when you hit one and got a cleavage surface, that made all the difference in the world to a rock description. But a person may not be able to do that often.
152:16:30|T|LMP|Does that answer your question, Tony?
152:16:32|C|Eng|Right. And the Station 4, 5, and 6 area, you mentioned that 5 and 6 the surfaces got progressively firmer. I wonder, could you see any contact or was it a gradual thing?
152:16:51|T|LMP|No, we couldn't. Just when we got off the Rover and you felt it under your feet. The softest spot was up on the top, at Station 4. Progressively firmer as we went out, like you say, went down to 6. And you just noticed it when you got out.
152:17:10|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
152:17:12|T|CDR|Of course, we were working in a couple of craters on Station 4. Right on the - you know - right on the rim of the craters, where you'd expect it'd be softer, too.
152:17:25|C|Eng|Okay. And Station 4, 5, and 6 also, we're pretty confident that the rocks at Station 4 were from South Ray. At 5 and 6 in particular, though, was there any indication that the craters - either by their orientation or from the secondary blocks lying around - that the source was, in fact, South Ray?
152:17:51|T|CDR|Yeah, I would think the crater at 5 was a South Ray crater. Although the rocks generally looked more rounded, maybe from a different layer .  - pattern, you should be able to see that in the film, but the pattern of rocks were all in the far wall, which was away from South Ray Crater.
152:18:14|C|Eng|Right. Incidentally, the Backroom is really impressed. They are very excited about your choice of sampling on that inner wall of that crater - I guess it was at 5 or 6 - and think that you had a good chance there of getting real Descartes. In fact, they think they've got it in the box. What they're thinking right now is that the areas where you're able to kick up and see white underneath are ray materials. But you didn't see that at 5 and 6. So, we think you may have gotten Descartes there.
152:18:47|T|CDR|Okay.  I'll tell you one thing. If this place had air, it'd sure be beautiful. It's beautiful with or without air, but the scenery today up on top of Stone Mountain you'd have to be there to see and to believe it. It's just dazzling. And I hope it showed up good on television -
152:19:15|C|Eng|It sure did, John. We're really impressed.
152:19:17|T|CDR|-
152:19:18|C|Eng|Hey, we have a bunch of questions we'd like to ask. But we're going to knock it off and let you get some sleep and we'll try to pick your mind when you get home here. But there's one thing on the Rover there. On the drive from Station 10 back to the LM, did you notice that the Nav system worked? Whether you got any distance on there in particular?
152:19:40|T|CDR|No, we only came about 25 yards -  I didn't notice, though, to tell you the truth.
152:19:48|C|Eng|Okay. Did the numbers go to zero when you reset at Station 10?
152:19:54|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
152:19:58|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
152:20:03|T|CDR|I tell you, that beauty is holding up like a real jewel.
152:20:11|T|CDR|
152:20:12|C|Eng|- hardware here. We wonder where SCB-2 went?
152:20:23|T|LMP|Okay. I emptied that in the SRC and it's on the Rover. We're gonna use it tomorrow.
152:20:31|C|Eng|Okay. I understand you dumped it into the SRC and the bag's on the Rover, still.
152:20:49|C|Eng|Okay. Good show -
152:20:50|T|LMP|We started dumping the stuff -
152:20:54|C|Eng|We were wondering if - wondering what happened to the SESC that was in the pocket there, but it looks like we're in good shape.
152:21:01|T|CDR|The SESC is back on the Rover. I was looking at it just before we got in.
152:21:06|C|Eng|Okay. That's the extent -
152:21:08|T|LMP|Yeah, that's .
152:21:09|C|Eng|- of the debriefing here. Why don't you head on with your meal and we'll have your Flight Plan updates for the -conference period.
152:21:19|T|LMP|Okay. We'll do it.
152:21:27|C|Eng|we've got a lot of Flight Plan changes here - about seven pages worth - and we'll put them in your conference period and if we don't get them all up tonight, we'll send you to bed on time and we'll sneak them in the morning.
152:21:43|T|CDR|Okay. Tell everybody in the Backroom &quot;thank you&quot; and we really enjoyed it today. By golly, that view from up on Stone Mountain is something else.
152:21:56|C|Eng|I'm sorry, John, our comm's pretty bad. We missed that. Could you say again -
152:21:59|T|LMP|Hey, Tony -
152:22:01|T|CDR|No, I won't say it again. I just wanted to say thank you to the Backroom boys.
152:22:10|T|LMP|Tony, I'd like to say the same thing. &quot;Thanks.&quot; I think they did a great job and they kept us thinking and on our toes and came up with the right suggestions at the opportune times and thank you, too, for keeping us going. It was a good job.
152:22:28|C|Eng|Hey, I went back in the Backroom after the EVA and they're just ecstatic back there. I know we didn't see exactly when we expected to see , but we think you got everything that we went up there for. We're in really good shape.
152:22:45|T|CDR|That Rover really - If you could have seen some of the things that that Rover did today, you wouldn't believe it.
152:22:57|T|LMP|You just can't believe the ridges and valleys and rilles, here. I tell you, the local slope might be 2 or 3 degrees, but, man, that Double Spot, whoever picked that place to land, it's the only level spot around here. Any place else, you'd really be in trouble.
152:23:30|T|CDR|Okeydokey.
152:58:07|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. Over.
152:58:11|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
152:58:15|T|LMP|Tony, we'd like to start on that PLSS O2 recharge, topoff-type thing if it's been an hour . Could y'all confirm that for us.
152:58:34|C|Eng|Charlie, I didn't understand your question. You say you'd like to do it in an hour?
152:58:43|T|LMP|No - No, the checklist says, &quot;Connect LM O2 to PLSS; Hi PLSS O2 fill, open, then close.&quot; So, we're supposed to verify that 1 hour has elapsed since initial recharge.
152:58:58|C|Eng|Okay. We'll start your hour.
152:59:07|T|LMP|No. You know, when we first got back in and we plugged up the oxygen to the PLSS, we're supposed to - From then to now, if it's been an hour, we can go ahead with this other topoff.
152:59:33|C|Eng|Stand by 1.  Okay. It's 2 hours since you started the original charge. If your question is, can you go right ahead with the topoff, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;.
153:00:26|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we're proceeding. Thank you.
153:10:59|C|Eng|Orion, Houston. Go Normal Voice and Hi Bit Rate. We have the 210.
153:11:27|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, you ought to have it. Over.
153:11:30|C|Eng|Okay, that is outstanding.  I can almost understand what you're saying, Charlie.
153:11:42|T|LMP|Yeah, get the grits out of my mouth. Is that our friends in Australia tonight?
153:11:51|C|Eng|Okay, we're on Goldstone 210.
153:11:57|T|LMP|Hello, our friends out on the Mojave. Good.
153:12:08|C|Eng|And why don't you give us a call when you're ready to take these Flight Plan updates?
153:12:16|T|CDR|Wilco.
153:25:46|T|LMP|Houston, we're going off biomed for a little bit.
153:25:51|C|Eng|Okay.
153:40:04|C|Eng|Orion, Houston.
153:40:11|T|CDR|Go ahead. Over.
153:40:13|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like to try to get the bulk of this Flight Plan update up tonight because we won't have the 210-foot dish until 2 hours before lift-off. How you doing up there?
153:40:25|T|CDR|We're coming right along, Tony.
153:40:29|C|Eng|Okay.
153:40:33|T|CDR|We'll be with you as quick as we can. Honest.
153:40:36|C|Eng|Understand.
153:40:40|T|CDR|No, I don't think you do; but it's all right.
153:41:55|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We've got both PLSSs recharged with water and the ten-minute oxygen topoff.
153:42:08|C|Eng|Okay.
153:43:02|T|CDR|Hey, Tony. What's your best guess about where we landed?
153:43:12|C|Eng|About where you landed? We're just going by what you said. Originally, we had you, I think, 150 meters north and 200 west and you said, today, that you were just north . We thought that the first estimate of 150 north and 200 west was compatible with the LRV data that you've got, the nav data, we kind of liked that one, but I haven't seen anything from the planners yet.
153:43:42|T|CDR|Okay. It's pretty hard to tell. From where we were at Station 4 up at Stone Mountain, it looked like - I could see Double Spot and maybe we're just a little past it , but not much.
153:44:07|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. Much as I'd like to sit here and talk about the landing site, Deke's here looking over my shoulder, and he's telling us we've got to get on with this Flight Plan update.
153:44:22|T|CDR|Okay. Let me get Charlie on comm. I want him to hear it, too.
153:44:25|C|Eng|Rog.
153:44:55|T|CDR|Okay, we're ready. Go ahead.
153:44:59|C|Eng|Okay, in your Surface Checklist, page 5-7.
153:45:06|T|CDR|Go.
153:45:08|C|Eng|&quot;Stow hammocks, roll up with sleep restraints&quot; to - that's on the right-hand column about three or four lines down - change it to &quot;Stow hammocks and sleep restraints in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>.&quot;
153:45:35|T|CDR|We could probably have figured that out. Go ahead.
153:45:38|C|Eng|Okay. I'm sure you could have. Okay, on that same column, at the bottom of the page, says &quot;Lift-off time data in book for rev 37 to 43,&quot; we'll change that to &quot;46 to 51&quot;.
153:45:59|T|CDR|46 to 51.
153:46:01|C|Eng|Okay, and right under that on the &quot;Pro Verb 37:06 Enter,&quot; we'd like to delete both of those lines.
153:46:11|T|CDR|They're deleted.
153:46:13|C|Eng|Okay, on page 5-8. On the left-hand column, it says &quot;Empty ETB as follows.&quot; We'd like to delete &quot;1 - HCEX MAG D and LCG compartment.&quot;
153:46:36|T|CDR|That's deleted.
153:46:37|C|Eng|Okay, and after &quot;Stow in ETB&quot; at the top of the next column, we'd like to add &quot;1 - HCEX MAG D.&quot;
153:47:01|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;1 - HCEX magazine D.&quot;
153:47:04|C|Eng|Okay, that's D as in Delta. And then in the same column down, it says &quot;2 - 16 Mags R and S.&quot; We'd like to change that to &quot;1 - 16 Mag S.&quot;
153:47:25|T|CDR|Okay, &quot; 1 - Mag S.&quot;
153:47:27|C|Eng|Okay, that's S as in Sugar. Okay, on 5-9, left-hand column near the bottom of the page, it says &quot;Stow ICG in ICG bag.&quot; We'd like to change that to &quot;Stow ICG in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>.&quot;
153:48:12|T|CDR|Okay.
153:48:13|C|Eng|Okay. And then at the bottom of the page after the &quot;Used food in containers,&quot; we'd like to add two lines. The first one is &quot;LCG adapters,&quot; and the second line is &quot;Urine receptacle.&quot;
153:48:46|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;LCG adapters, two; and urine receptacle, one.&quot;
153:48:57|C|Eng|&quot;Battery management at 164 plus 45&quot; in the right-hand column.
153:49:36|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;Battery management at 164 hours and 45 minutes.&quot;
153:49:41|C|Eng|Okay, I'll send up the stuff for your cue cards later. We'll go on to page 7-1.  And I'd like to know if you'd like the change in times in the Surface Checklist. That's what some of these changes are.
153:50:13|T|CDR|Not particularly.
153:50:15|C|Eng|Okay, I won't send those, then.  Okay, we'll have to go on to 7-5, then.
153:50:33|T|CDR|Okay, we're at 7-5.
153:50:38|C|Eng|Telemetry PCM, Lo&quot;, &quot;S-Band, Voice and Down Voice Backup&quot;. We'd like to delete all that.
153:50:59|T|CDR|Okay, that's all done.
153:51:01|C|Eng|Okay, and after &quot;BSLSS/rock bag against hatch,&quot; add &quot;Report <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ApolloPRD.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">PRD</a> readings to Houston.&quot;
153:51:25|T|CDR|Okay. &quot;Report the roentgens to Houston.&quot;
153:51:27|C|Eng|Okay, on 7-5 and 6, delete all of the &quot;Doff suits.&quot;
153:52:00|T|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
153:52:02|C|Eng|Okay. On 7-6, delete &quot;EVA debriefing with Houston&quot;, and delete &quot;Eat period&quot; right after it.
153:52:16|T|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
153:52:17|C|Eng|And change &quot;158:22 pre-sleep and equipment stowage&quot; to &quot;172 plus 32 equipment stowage&quot;, and that's 27 minutes.
153:52:42|T|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
153:52:44|C|Eng|After &quot;Equipment stowage, 27 minutes&quot; add &quot;Circuit breaker panel 11 </a> ), Heaters AOT , Closed.&quot;
153:52:58|T|CDR|Okay -
153:52:59|C|Eng|That would be right below the &quot;Solar wind ISA - &quot;
153:53:01|T|CDR|- before the -  Okay.
153:53:09|C|Eng|Okay, and we'd like to - I'll hold.
153:53:30|C|Eng|You ready?
153:53:31|T|CDR|Okay. Then what?
153:53:32|C|Eng|Okay. On the &quot;Stow the ETB against the hatch&quot; in the next line, change to &quot;Stow ETB in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#ISA" target="alsj">ISA</a> big pocket.&quot;
153:54:05|T|CDR|Okay. &quot;Stow ETB in ISA big pocket.&quot; Go ahead.
153:54:08|C|Eng|Okay. On page 7-7, delete everything except the first three lines in the left-hand column.
153:54:26|T|CDR|Understand; delete everything on page 7-7 but the first three lines.
153:54:33|C|Eng|That's right. And page 7-8, delete the whole page.
153:54:51|T|CDR|That's done.
153:54:52|C|Eng|Okay. On page 7-9. we'd like to add at the left top side, &quot;Rendever - &quot; Correction, &quot;Rendezvous Radar Operate, Close ; Rendezvous Radar Standby, Open ; Circuit Breaker Panel 11, LGC/DSKY, Close ; Circuit Breaker Panel 11 </a> ), Mission Timer, Close.&quot;
153:55:59|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
153:56:01|C|Eng|Okay. After the &quot;Gimbal Lock Light, Off,&quot; about halfway down the page, write in &quot;Delay Verb 16 Noun 65 Enter, mission timer up&quot; - correction, &quot;Mission timer check until after up-links.&quot;
153:56:34|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
153:56:37|C|Eng|Okay, on 7-9 still. After &quot;Verb 21 Noun 27 Enter, 0 Enter,&quot; add &quot;Wait for go-ahead from MSFN.&quot;  Okay. First, some information here; you might note that this is about the time we'll be getting the 210, and we'll be able to watch the power-up.
153:57:14|T|CDR|Okay. But we always wait for a go-ahead from MSFN on E-memory dumps.
153:57:24|C|Eng|Right. That's correct. But we're adding it here anyway. Okay -
153:57:33|T|CDR|Okay.
153:57:34|C|Eng|On the &quot;Telemetry, Hi, verify,&quot; the Telemetry will be in Lo, so we'll add &quot;Telemetry, Hi and Voice to Voice.&quot;
153:57:57|T|CDR|Okay.
153:57:59|C|Eng|Okay. And we'd like to change the up-links to &quot;Lift-off time update, time increment update, RLS, and CSM state vector.&quot;
153:58:36|T|CDR|Okay. Understand MSFN will up-link the lift-off time update, time increment update, the CSM state vector, and the RLS.
153:58:45|C|Eng|Okay. Good. After &quot;Updata Link - Off&quot;, add - that's at the bottom of the page - &quot;Verb 05 Noun 01 Enter, 1706 Enter&quot;, and &quot;Verify T-ephem&quot;.
153:59:08|T|CDR|Okay. What is it supposed to be?
153:59:13|C|Eng|We'll give you a call on that.
153:59:18|T|CDR|Okay, is it the same as it was in the Activation Checklist?
153:59:24|C|Eng|Negative on that. You should see it in the DSKY.
153:59:29|T|CDR|I wouldn't think it would be.  Yeah.
153:59:36|C|Eng|Okay. On the top of the right-hand column, add &quot;Circuit Breaker Panel 16 ), Inverter 2, Close,&quot; and &quot;Inverter 2.&quot;
154:00:09|T|CDR|Okay. &quot;Circuit Breaker 16, Inverter 2, Close. Select Inverter 2.&quot; Go ahead.
154:00:13|C|Eng|Okay. And that &quot;Power Amplifier, Primary&quot;, change that to &quot;Secondary&quot;. And change, in the next line, &quot;Telemetry, Hi&quot; to &quot;Lo&quot;. And delete &quot;Voice to Voice&quot;.

154:02:11|C|Eng|And on &quot;Parking the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rendradar.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">rendezvous radar</a> antenna&quot;, we'd like to change that to &quot;Trunnion 0, Shaft 030.00.&quot;
154:02:41|T|CDR|Okay. Change it to &quot;Trunnion 0, Shaft 030.00.&quot;
154:02:47|C|Eng|That's affirmative. On page 7-11, change the time &quot;168 plus 10&quot; to &quot;173 plus 29&quot;. And delete the rest of the page.
154:03:16|T|CDR|Okay. That's done.
154:03:18|C|Eng|Okay. On page 7-12, delete everything except the &quot;VHF voice check&quot; on the left and the &quot;Ascent pads update&quot; at the bottom.

154:04:05|T|CDR|Okay. That's completed.
154:04:27|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
154:04:28|C|Eng|And right under that line, we'd like to add, &quot;Stow <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="alsj">purse</a> in ISA bottom pocket&quot;. And right under that, &quot;Stow ISA on the aft engine cover&quot;.
154:04:51|T|CDR|Okay, stow purse in ISA which pocket?
154:04:54|C|Eng|The bottom pocket.
154:05:14|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;Stow purse in ISA bottom pocket&quot;; and &quot;Stow ISA on the aft engine cover&quot;.
154:05:19|C|Eng|Okay. On page 8-1. Change the time &quot;170 plus 30&quot; to &quot;174 plus 29&quot;.
154:05:40|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.

154:05:57|T|CDR|Okay, go.
154:05:58|C|Eng|- third line, seven from the left, &quot;Open S-Band Antenna&quot;. And on the fourth line, again, &quot;Open S-Band Antenna&quot; about right under it.
154:06:15|T|CDR|Okay. &quot;Open AC S-Band Antenna, open the S-Band Antenna in the Comm, and the S-Band Antenna Heater.&quot;
154:06:26|C|Eng|Okay, on 8-5, on the AGS column, change &quot;373 &quot; to &quot;&quot;.
154:06:56|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;plus 03440.&quot;
154:07:00|C|Eng|That's correct. On 8-6, change the time &quot;170 plus 50&quot; to &quot;174 plus 49&quot;.  And delete the -
154:07:22|T|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
154:07:23|C|Eng|- steerable antenna Pitch and Yaw procedures.  And right under that, change the &quot;170 plus 55&quot; to &quot;174 plus 54.&quot;
154:07:46|T|CDR|Okay.
154:07:47|C|Eng|On 8-7, change &quot;171 plus 00&quot; to &quot;174 plus 59&quot;.

154:08:33|T|CDR|Okay.
154:08:37|C|Eng|On page 8-10, change the time &quot;171 plus 15&quot; to &quot;175 plus 14&quot;.
154:08:56|T|CDR|Okay.
154:08:57|C|Eng|On page 8-12, change the time &quot;171 plus 28&quot; to &quot;175 plus 27&quot;.
154:09:15|T|CDR|Understand &quot;175 plus 27&quot;.
154:09:18|C|Eng|That's correct. On 8-13, &quot;171 plus 30&quot; to &quot;175 plus 29&quot;.
154:09:34|T|CDR|Okay, &quot;175 plus 29&quot;.
154:09:37|C|Eng|Right. On page 8-14, row 1, &quot;Open S-Band Antenna&quot;.
154:09:50|T|CDR|Okay.
154:09:52|C|Eng|Okay, on 8-15, row 3, &quot;Open S-Band Antenna&quot;. Also on row 4.
154:10:03|T|CDR|I got you.
154:10:04|C|Eng|On 8-16, change the time &quot;171 plus 33&quot; to &quot;175 plus 32&quot;.  Change the time &quot;171 plus 35&quot; to &quot;175 plus 34&quot;.  And at the bottom change &quot;171 plus 40&quot; -
154:10:30|T|CDR|Okay, 175:32 and 175:34.
154:10:33|C|Eng|- to 175 plus 39. And I copied yours.
154:10:44|T|CDR|Okay, 175:39.
154:10:48|C|Eng|Okay, and we'd like to go to your EVA-3 cue card.  Okay, John, we're gonna hold that cue card. We'll pick it up first thing in the morning. I've given you a lot of stuff here.
154:11:08|T|CDR|We're ready to copy. It ain't so much, Tony. You're not doing anything but changing it so we can lift off without throwing everything out.  -
154:11:20|C|Eng|Right. Okay, on the EVA prep.
154:11:25|T|CDR|Okay.
154:11:26|C|Eng|&quot;S-Band Mode, PM; Transmitter/Receiver, Secondary; Power AMP, Secondary; Voice, Down/Voice Backup; PCM, PCM; and Range, Off&quot;.
154:12:14|T|LMP|Okay, we copy that, Tony. Go to PM, Secondary, Secondary, Down Voice Backup, PCM, and Off.
154:12:21|C|Eng|Very good. And the Telemetry Biomed, we'll go to Right on that instead of Off. And change Recorder, On to Recorder, Off.
154:12:40|T|LMP|Okay. Telemetry Biomed is Right, and scratch Recorder.
154:12:46|C|Eng|Rog. Okay, and on the EVA-3 Post card, &quot;Prep for Equipment Jett 1&quot; , change &quot;31 percent&quot; to &quot;22 percent&quot;.
154:13:06|T|LMP|Stand by 1.
154:13:09|C|Eng|Okay, it's on the back side, bottom half, left-hand column, about an inch up from the bottom.
154:13:18|T|LMP|Yeah, I see it. Okay, &quot;22&quot;.
154:13:25|C|Eng|Right. And change &quot;Remove ISS&quot; - it's right under that - &quot;Remove ISS, wrap and tie&quot; to &quot;Stow in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>.&quot;
154:13:40|T|LMP|Okay.
154:13:42|C|Eng|After &quot;Yo-Yo's &quot;, add &quot;ISS and helmet bag&quot;.
154:13:58|T|LMP|Okay, &quot;ISS and helmet bag&quot;.
154:14:02|C|Eng|Okay, and on up in the next column at the top, under &quot;Cabin repress&quot; , delete &quot;Comm: Uplink Squelch, Off&quot;.
154:14:23|T|LMP|Okay, that's third column, two lines from the bottom?
154:14:30|C|Eng|Right, that's correct. Third column, two lines from the bottom. Okay -
154:14:37|T|LMP|Okay.
154:14:48|T|LMP|I was afraid you would.
154:14:51|C|Eng|Sorry, John.
154:14:52|T|CDR|Okay.
154:14:53|C|Eng|one, remove any of the sharp edges with the scissors and examine the entire length of the antenna for cracks. And we'll give you time to dig that out.
154:15:26|T|CDR|Okay. The reason that it's broke is on account of I climbed in here with it open, because we're being rushed there toward the end.
154:15:34|C|Eng|Rog, John. You're exactly right. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have let you get so far behind.
154:15:41|T|CDR|Well, that's all right. There's no problem! We had plenty of consumables, and where's the fire?
154:16:24|C|Eng|Right. We'll give you some words on that in the morning. But, if you see any cracks, we'd like you to tape around the antenna about three loops, it says, such that it covers the crack of about a half inch on either side.
154:16:24|T|CDR|Three loops of tape?
154:16:27|C|Eng|Rog.
154:16:32|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The antenna is about a half inch longer than the pen-lights that we carry, and it's in good shape except for a little crack at the top where it broke off.
154:17:08|C|Eng|Okay. That crack on the end there, we'd just like you to trim that back. And, examine the thing down where it goes into that connector there and make sure it isn't cracked down there.
154:17:23|T|CDR|Okay. We already did that, and it's not cracked down there.
154:17:25|C|Eng|Okay, good show.
154:17:26|T|CDR|Just right up at the end.
154:17:28|C|Eng|Rog.
154:17:29|T|CDR|And Charlie's got three loops of tape around it.
154:17:48|C|Eng|Okay. As far as we're concerned, the Government's gonna allow you to sleep. We'd like you to go into your pre-sleep now, and we expect an LiOH change, and we understand you're gonna call your <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ApolloPRD.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">PRD</a> readings before you go to bed.
154:18:14|T|CDR|First we've heard about it, but we'll do it, I guess.  Okay. Tony, could we beg off on a PRD readings unless
154:18:46|C|Eng|Rog. It's my error. The PRD's in the morning. Sorry, John.
154:18:52|T|CDR|Okay. We got the suits piled one on top of the other, and it'll be a mess. The bags are up around the legs. It'll be a mess to dig them out of there.
154:19:27|C|Eng|Roger. Deke's standing here, and he said y'all did a beautiful day's work, and he's anxious to see y'all hit the sack ASAP .
154:19:37|T|CDR|Okay.
154:19:39|C|Eng|And, I sure agree on that beautiful day's work.
154:19:41|T|CDR|Where's this MCC -Houston -  Where's this MCC-H conference at?
154:19:49|C|Eng|It's just over. You just had it.
154:19:55|T|CDR|Oh, I thought maybe you guys were going to the Wheel or something.
154:19:59|C|Eng|You mean you didn't enjoy it ?
154:20:11|T|CDR|I would be interested in what our EVA is gonna look like for tomorrow. Maybe I was off comm and you told Charlie or something.
154:20:23|C|Eng|No. We haven't said anything about it. The planners will be back working on it. I can tell you what it looked like before EVA-2. It was a 5-hour EVA with about an hour up on North Ray and about 20 minutes at Station 13 and essentially the rest of the time back in the LM/ALSEP area, especially east of the LM, there.
154:20:50|T|CDR|Okay. It's probably subject to a change, huh?
154:20:55|C|Eng|Yeah, it probably is. You got a lot of good data today, and that'll make them think about it overnight, anyway. But I'm sure everybody's sort of drooling about North Ray.
154:21:05|T|CDR|Yeah. I kind of feel like if we're ever going to be able to sort this out, North Ray's probably the place. Personally, to be able to get down 200 meters is something we probably ought to do to see just how complicated this thing really is.
154:21:43|T|CDR|Okay, Lo Bit Rate and Down Voice Backup. You got it.
154:21:46|C|Eng|Okay.
154:21:52|C|Eng|Okay. Biomed, Left.
154:21:57|T|LMP|Yea!
154:22:03|C|Eng|Charlie -
154:22:13|T|LMP|Okay. We still put in a strong vote for North Ray. It looks accessible, and there's a tremendous block up there we'd like to look at.
154:22:23|C|Eng|Okay. We heard you talk about that. I vote for it, too. I'm gonna go back and talk to them before I go home. We'll see y'all in the morning. Good night.
154:22:33|T|CDR|Okay. Take it easy, Tony. Thank you, now. That was a good day's work for yourself.
154:22:38|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, one final comment. We've been talking about that crater that we took a pan of as we spun around and - I said, looked like Big Sag. John and I are leaning towards endogenic on that, and hopefully from the films that we got you might be able to sort that out.
154:22:58|C|Eng|Okay. We'll sure take that in consideration. I don't know whether it'll affect tomorrow, but I think it's a good observation. We'll see you.  And, Charlie, we still have a Hi bit rate. We'd like to go to Lo.
154:23:25|T|CDR|Okay, Lo bit rate. And Charlie's changing the LiOH canister right now.
154:23:35|C|Eng|Okay.
154:36:13|T|LMP|Houston, 16. Over.
154:36:22|C|Roo|Yup.
154:36:24|T|LMP|Hello, Houston. Houston, Orion. Over.  Houston, Orion. If you're reading me, you have a lot of static on the up-link. Over.
154:36:49|C|Roo|Okay, Percy Precision. Sorry about that, and we had the up-link turned down. Now I guess somebody - Did you hear us comment?
154:37:05|T|LMP|Somebody was blasting us out of the cockpit. I turned the Squelch, Off, but now whoever - Who's that talking, is that Stu?
154:37:17|C|Roo|Yeah, Charlie! Boy, you're sure looking good up there.
154:37:21|T|LMP|Hey, babe, how you doing?! Nice to talk to you.
154:37:26|C|Roo|Yeah -
154:37:27|T|LMP|Hey, you were right. Greatest thrill of my whole life. Really big. Really a thrill, really great.
154:37:33|C|Roo|Oh, man, you're really swinging.  Okay. Charlie, we'll do something about that uplink, and we're working maybe the switch configuration now.
154:37:57|T|LMP|Okay, this is beautiful right now, Stu.
154:38:04|C|Roo|There would be an old saying that would apply to that, then, wouldn't there?
154:38:12|T|LMP|That's right.
154:39:07|C|Roo|Hey, Charlie, could we have you check your uplink Squelch. Is that Off?
154:39:18|T|LMP|Yeah, it's Off right now.
154:39:25|C|Roo|Okay, Charlie. We're going to kill the uplink. I'll be standing by. If you hear the noise, give us a call back. And have a good night's rest, boy; we'll have a cool one for you.
154:39:41|T|LMP|That sounds good. Hey, we haven't gotten to the pre-sleep checklist part. If it calls for Squelch, Enable, I can turn it on, and we'll be okay.
154:40:10|C|Roo|Okay, Charlie. Looks like we wanted you to go to sleep a little early, and we got ahead of you. Could you call us just when you finish your pre-sleep checklist, and at that time we'll have the right configuration.
154:40:27|T|LMP|Okay, Houston - Stu. And, hey, since we only got a watch on Houston time, could you give us a time - what time we're supposed to be up in the morning?
154:40:40|C|Roo|Okay. Stand by.
154:41:28|C|Roo|Okay, Charlie. We're going to wake you up 8 hours from now. I'm showing around 10:35 , so you'll be getting a call around 06:35, in the morning.
154:41:43|T|CDR|Okay, but we're about a half hour away from being asleep.  We're still gonna get up at 08:35, right? 06:35?
154:42:00|C|Roo|Okay, John. We'll give you a call at 7 o'clock.
154:42:14|T|CDR|Okay.  Hey, only with the understanding that that doesn't take a half hour off our EVA, huh?
154:42:49|C|Roo|Okay. Flight says that since they got all those good up-links changes to you this evening, everything looks real clean. And he feels that you can get into the EVA on time.
162:38:32|C|Pet|Orion, Houston.
162:38:40|T|LMP|Who speaks?
162:38:42|C|Pet|Roger. How are you doing this morning?
162:38:49|T|LMP|Super. Is it time to get up?
162:38:52|C|Pet|Yes, sir.
162:39:01|T|LMP|Okay, reveille, reveille.  Okay, Pete, we're stirring; we'll be up in a minute.
162:39:41|C|Pet|Roger.  Okay, Orion. You're Stay for EVA-3.
162:40:05|T|LMP|Hey, that's mighty nice of you. And we were looking for reveille for about 7 o'clock, but we'll get going right now.
162:40:15|C|Pet|Roger.  These flight directors are slave drivers.
162:42:29|C|Pet|And, Orion, would you give us Voice, Normal, and Hi Bit Rate, please?
162:46:29|C|Pet|Orion, Houston. Let's go back to Lo Bit Rate, please.
162:48:00|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. We have a crew status report for you.
162:48:08|C|Pet|Okay, Orion. Go ahead.
162:48:23|T|LMP|Okay. For John, yesterday he had Day 7, Meal A; and Day 7 - Stand by - and Day 7, Meal B. On day 7 Meal A, he ate everything but the beef steak. On Meal B, he ate everything but the romaine soup and the butterscotch pudding. He had no medication, and he'd like for the docs to guess how much sleep he had to start with, and then we'll give you our estimate. For me, we had Day - same two meals; I ate everything on meal A except the bacon squares and on meal B everything but the romaine soup and the butterscotch pudding. I had no medication, and I slept for 7 hours. Over.
162:49:34|C|Pet|Roger. And we estimate John slept 6 and a half to 7 hours.
162:49:44|T|LMP|Okay. He was going to say 7. That's great.
162:49:49|C|Pet|Roger.  Okay. And, Orion, I've got block data and a note from the Surgeon and a battery-management procedure at about 164 hours any time you're ready to copy.
162:50:24|T|LMP|Okay. You can go with the block data.
162:50:27|C|Pet|Okay. The block data starts at T46, 163:54:55; TPI, 166:44:00; T47, 165:53:25, 168:42:30; T48, 167:51:55, 170:41:30; T49. 169:50:26, 172:40:00; T50, 171:48:57, 174:39:00; T51, 173:47:29, 176:38:00.
162:51:55|T|LMP|Give me number 50 again, please.
162:52:00|C|Pet|T50 was 171:48:57; the TPI was 174:39:00.
162:52:16|T|LMP|Okay. I'll just read you back the lift-off times, starting with 46, 163 plus 54 plus 55; 165 plus 53 plus 25; 167 plus 51 plus 55; 169 plus 56 plus 26; 171 plus 48 plus 57; and 173 plus 47 plus 29. Over.
162:52:40|C|Pet|Let's verify T49 as 169:50:26.
162:52:51|T|LMP|That's a &quot;Charlie&quot;.
162:53:02|C|Pet|Okay. And the battery management is at 164:45.
162:53:16|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. What time is it now?
162:53:19|C|Pet|It's 163:05.
162:53:55|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. On that battery management, when we get to that time, just give me a call, if you will. Over.
162:54:00|C|Pet|Will do.  Okay, and the note from the Flight Surgeon requests that you have the crew check the Biomed harness prior to suit-up for EVA-3. And if you have the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ApolloPRD.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">PRD</a> readouts handy, we'd like them; otherwise, we'll skip them.
162:54:28|T|LMP|Okay. I'll give you Biomed in just a second, and John's was on all night, so I guess his is okay. And we'll give you the PRDs like we always do when we get suited up.
162:54:41|C|Pet|Rog. That's fine, Charlie. And John's Biomed data did look good all night.
162:54:51|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay. You're looking at my Biomed now, Pete.
162:55:08|C|Pet|Okay. Stand by a minute.  Looks good, Charlie.
162:55:19|T|LMP|Okay.  back to John.
162:55:24|C|Pet|Okay.  Okay. Both the Biomeds look real good.
162:57:01|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. How do you read? Over.
162:57:03|C|Pet|Okay, you're loud and clear.
162:57:08|T|CDR|Okay. And we're going on with the PLSS top-off right now .
162:57:13|C|Pet|Say again, John.  Okay. Copy PLSS top-off.
162:57:19|T|CDR|Topping off the PLSSs right now.
162:57:21|C|Pet|Roger.  And, Orion, we just want to remind you again that we want to put the Commander's OPS on the LMP PLSS.
162:58:07|T|CDR|Okay. The EVC's not in the OPS?
162:58:14|C|Pet|We didn't copy the question, John.
162:58:19|T|CDR|I say I thought there was something about a radio transmitter that had to be - Is the radio transmitter located out on the PLSS? Is that the answer to that?
162:58:32|C|Pet|That's affirmative, John.
163:04:12|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm going off Biomed for about 10 minutes. Over.
163:04:18|C|Eng|Okay, John.
163:45:19|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. How does that Biomed look to you now?
163:45:24|C|Eng|Okay. It looks good here, John.
163:45:32|T|CDR|Okay. Fine.
163:45:37|C|Eng|How are you doing up there?
163:45:43|T|LMP|Oh, just fine. We finished eating, and we're ready to don suits now .
163:45:52|C|Eng|Okay. Fine. Do you want a quick briefing on the traverse today ?
163:46:00|T|LMP|Okay. One comment, Tony, that we were talking about last night that we didn't pass on, that the feeling we got from all the crystalline rocks was that they had a sugary texture to them.
163:46:18|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. The changes for the traverse today are pretty simple. We've got changes to your Cuff Checklist if you want them, or I can real-time them . I think we can real-time them if that's okay with you. But I'll outline them now. The only change on egress -
163:46:44|T|CDR|Yeah, summarize it for us, please.
163:47:15|C|Eng|We're going to drop the near-field polarimetry up there , and we'll concentrate on big boulder samples, a permanently-shadowed sample, and the padded bag sample on the special samples area. We'll still like a stereo pan - a far-field polarimetry of the crater interior; we'll try to get about an 80-meter base on that; and, when you get up there, Charlie, I'll brief you on what looks like the best way to do that. And we'll return along the same route you went up, and about one-half to one kilometer off the rim when you still feel you're on the continuous ejecta blanket; we'll call that Station 13. We'll do a Station 13 with the TV , and we'll lengthen it to 15 to 20 minutes. I've got a fixed time here, but I don't see it right in front of me right now. And that, instead of a rock/soil , will be a rake soil plus a couple of documented samples. And then the rest of the time will be spent back in the LM area.
163:48:13|C|Eng|We'll make a Station 10 Prime which is about 50 meters west of your Station 10. So it makes a triangle with the deep core, which would be south of it, and the Station 10 which would be northeast of it, and then Station 10 Prime which makes that northwest corner of the triangle, and we'll ask for a rake soil at Station 10 Prime, a double core at that station, a rake soil at Station 10; and then whatever time is left to 35 minutes will be documented samples.
163:48:48|C|Eng|Now, the end of the EVA is pretty much nominal except, John, when you go out to the permanent parking location of the Rover , we'd like you to make sure you take a camera along, and we'll do an LPM measurement there after you've parked it, and we'll also ask you to try to find us a dense crystalline rock if you can find it. If you can't find a crystalline one, then at least a dense breccia, and we'll do the rock-on-top-of-the-LPM measurement . And that's pretty much it. I'm going to try to keep you to the timeline as much as possible because we've really got a hard time for getting back in. I know they won't allow us to go over at all.
163:49:31|T|CDR|Okay. Well, let me tell you this, Tony. Believe it or not, the camera is out in the Sun right now, part of it.
163:49:41|C|Eng|Is that right? Did the Sun come down -
163:49:43|T|CDR|The cassette handle is out in the Sun.
163:49:48|C|Eng|Okay. I guess we'll probably have to slide that back into the shade again.
163:49:57|T|CDR|Yeah.
163:50:01|C|Eng|Where do you think it should go? Why don't you just pick a place? I think you're better positioned than the Backroom. I'm sure you'll have better luck at it.
163:50:15|T|CDR|Okay. Well, it only needs to be moved about 3 or 4 inches.
163:50:20|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.  And, on the LRV, we're going to ask you to go back to the normal configuration on the PWM. If you experience any difficulty, then, we'll go back to the PWM configuration you're in now. And the attitude indicator - or that pitchup problem - won't cause us any serious problem. Just when you do the Nav update, try to park in a level area. And the Backroom is hoping that the Nav problem was a temporary one; that'll be okay for your EVA-3. Either way, you shouldn't really have any problem because you can probably see the area you're going to, and you're going to go right back along your tracks so we're not too worried about it if you don't have distance .
163:51:06|C|Eng|And we're projecting hot battery again on EVA-3, and we may have some changes during the EVA on that. Your mobility rates during EVA-2 were very near those predicted; and we have a large margin of battery power, so we're in good shape there. Also, they mentioned that if you have a dust problem from that missing fender - rear fender - there is a way of putting one of the front fenders on the back; but, golly, I don't know whether you really want to do that.
163:51:45|T|CDR|Yeah, I don't either, Tony. We'd get the dust from the front fender, then, probably.
163:52:15|T|CDR|Okay.
163:52:44|C|Eng|Incidentally, it's a bright, sunny, beautiful Sunday morning here in Houston.
163:53:03|T|CDR|At like 13 minutes to 8, huh?
163:53:12|C|Eng|Right.

164:16:35|C|Eng|Okay.
164:17:19|C|Eng|Hey, Charlie. How was it climbing back into that suit again?
164:17:30|T|LMP|Feels good once you get it on, but they sure are filthy.
164:17:35|C|Eng|I bet they are.
164:17:36|T|LMP|Get your hands really dirty.
164:17:38|C|Eng|Ah.
164:32:43|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm ready for the battery management .

164:37:56|C|Eng|. Well, you'll just take off faster without it.  Besides, you're gonna replace all that with rocks.  Incidentally, you have about 123 pounds of rocks, which means you can get about another 100 pounds.
164:39:00|T|CDR|We do, huh?
165:00:24|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read? Over.

165:14:39|T|CDR|Tool harness.
165:14:40|T|LMP|Yeah, it's fine. Well, it slipped off the bottom, but we'll fix it when we get outside, okay?
165:14:51|T|CDR|Okay.
165:14:53|T|LMP|Now, let me check your Velcro. Wait a minute. Let me get -  up in there.  I can do it better from this side, John.
165:15:07|T|CDR|Sure.
165:15:10|T|LMP|Alarm.
165:15:20|T|CDR|Okay; I knocked my microphone switch out.
165:15:37|T|LMP|It felt like it clicked. It felt like it locked to me.
165:15:50|T|CDR|No, it's not locked.
165:16:00|T|LMP|You want me to stand up, or you stand up?
165:16:02|T|CDR|Well, you stand up, Charlie. I can't see under your chin.
165:16:04|T|LMP|Okay.
165:16:22|T|CDR|The top of your head is keeping it from going down, Charlie.
165:16:26|T|LMP|Shouldn't - the top of my head.
165:16:26|T|CDR|Check the back - Make sure the O2 hoses are out of the way.
165:16:31|T|CDR|Ah; I see what it is. The Velc.
165:16:36|T|LMP|I tell you, this thing - If you Velcro this -

165:16:59|T|CDR|Got it, Charlie.
165:17:01|T|LMP|Got to watch it lock from here.
165:17:03|T|CDR|Let's try it this way. It didn't lock up though.
165:17:10|T|LMP|Hardest part of prep
165:17:14|T|CDR|One of the hardest parts, Charlie.
165:17:16|T|LMP|- for this glove donning; I can't do that even.

165:42:10|C|Eng|Rog, all circuit breakers in.
165:42:36|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. We'd like you to slide it just out of the Sun so that you feel pretty confident it'll stay in for the EVA. And I have a new setting for you. Just try to hold the alignment you have now, and we won't re-align it.
165:42:57|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I got the batteries in. You've got a signal strength of 4.  You're on -

165:43:32|T|CDR|What'd you say the elevation was?

165:43:45|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
165:43:47|T|CDR|Okay. That's well out of the Sun now, Houston. And it's not looking at anything. It's about a foot past the ladder.

166:04:30|T|CDR|Okay, well, let me get in.
166:04:35|T|LMP|Okay. Why don't you bounce in.
166:04:39|T|LMP|Super job, there.  - . Boy, that's - Umm -  There it is and I support the Nav align by being able to get in the machine.
166:05:07|T|CDR|Gee whiz, Charlie. I think you broke it.
166:05:08|T|LMP|I hope not.
166:05:17|T|LMP|Tony, a point - not that mission before - but this seatbelt adjustment was just perfect for me - from the airplane.
166:05:28|C|Eng|Okay, good data point.
166:05:29|T|CDR|And me, too. Seatbelt - Seatbelt's fastened.
166:05:33|T|CDR|Okay, we're going back to the normal configuration.
166:05:37|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine.
166:05:39|T|CDR|PMW  is in Both. And the Drive Enable is in - All those switches are up. And the steering is okay. Going to Primary.  Coming around for a Nav align.
166:06:16|T|CDR|I think I'd better get up here on this level spot.
166:06:20|T|LMP|Umm.
166:06:25|T|CDR|Charlie, now what -
166:06:27|T|LMP|That feels pretty level.
166:06:28|T|CDR|Yeah, I reckon.
166:06:29|T|LMP|I reckon too.
166:06:31|C|Eng|Right. On the Drive Enables, we'd like the Left Rear and the Right Rear to PWM-2.
166:06:41|T|CDR|Yeah, we've got that. It's normal configuration.
166:06:43|C|Eng|Okay, good show. That's what we want.
166:06:45|T|LMP|Okay, we're in 3 degrees right roll. Hey, the pitch needle is behind there, and I would say it's saying 2 degrees pitch up if the little needle was right in the middle. But it isn't very much , Houston.
166:07:03|C|Eng|Okay.
166:07:04|T|CDR|What happened on that indicator is that the dial has falling off, if you can believe such a thing. The little needle is still back there. It don't know the dial's fallen off, and it's working fine. One degree right roll. -
166:07:19|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that, and we need an SSD reading.
166:07:21|T|CDR|- And I think we're pretty well level in pitch.  Three and a half degrees right. Almost four. No, three degrees right, excuse me.
166:07:31|C|Eng|Okay, copy.
166:07:33|T|LMP|And we're - Our -
166:07:38|C|Eng|And if -
166:07:39|T|LMP|Our heading is 264, if you can believe such a thing.
166:07:43|C|Eng|Okay, and if you want to power up -
166:07:44|T|CDR|That's about right on.
166:07:45|T|LMP|Yeah.
166:07:46|C|Eng|I'd like the LRV readings.
166:07:51|T|CDR|We're powered up.
166:07:53|T|LMP|Okay, 60 on the left. Okay, 264, 000, 000, 000, amp-hours is 60, 115; off-scale low, off-scale low. Okay, volts are 65, 65; 102, 120, off-scale low, off- scale low; and off-scale low, off-scale low.
166:08:27|C|Eng|Okay, we'll stick with the normal configuration you've got there, and we'd like to verify that you went back to Amps on the readout.
166:08:41|T|CDR|That's verified.
166:08:43|C|Eng|Okay.  Okay, we've got 258 on the torquing angle.
166:08:52|T|CDR|The rascally thing is only off -  Okay, 258.
166:09:08|T|CDR|How about that? I put my Diverter in Minimum; I didn't think I'd reach it on this round.
166:09:16|C|Eng|Good show.
166:09:18|T|LMP|Okay. First heading out of here, John, is 030. 030 supposedly. Okay. The DAC is On.
166:09:33|T|CDR|Shoot, that thing drifts.
166:09:51|C|Eng|Charlie, can you turn that DAC off for another 19 minutes?
166:09:54|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm going to be spending - .
166:09:57|C|Eng|I'll give you a mark .
166:09:58|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, it's Off.
166:10:06|T|CDR|I'll tell you, this ridge up here would be a good place to park the Rover, Houston, if you want - .We're reading - I think it 's working. It's reading 162 and 0.1 now. And that's how far away we are.
166:10:20|C|Eng|Good show.
166:10:21|T|CDR|This ridge would be a good place to park the Rover. Up north of it . I don't know if you can stand it thermally.
166:11:25|T|CDR|I think the boulder population is starting to thin, Charlie.
166:11:27|T|LMP|I do, too. They're getting smaller, and the cobbles are getting smaller. Looks like we could be just out of this ray. We don't see any - maybe one or two - of the half-a-meter-size boulders now, Tony.
166:11:41|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. There are a couple of those mounds mapped about 200 meters off to your left. We were wondering if you could see those.
166:12:05|T|CDR|Better go over this way more, Charlie.
166:12:07|T|LMP|Yeah. There's North Ray right up there. Look at the big rocks , John.
166:12:10|T|CDR|Yeah.
166:12:33|T|CDR|See, there's Palmetto, too.
166:12:53|T|CDR|We may be into Palmetto right now, Charlie.
166:12:55|T|LMP|Huh?
166:12:57|T|CDR|may be Palmetto.
166:12:58|T|LMP|No. That's over there on the rim, isn't it?
166:12:59|T|CDR|Huh?
166:13:00|T|LMP|That big thing right there?
166:13:04|T|LMP|No, Palmetto's at -
166:13:05|C|Eng|You should be about halfway to Palmetto.
166:13:06|T|LMP|- 2.1.
166:13:09|C|Eng|You're looking right below <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">Turtle Mountain</a>, we bet.
166:13:11|T|CDR|Yeah. That's where we are.
166:13:17|T|LMP|Okay. Up at Station 11 and 12 -
166:13:20|T|CDR|Any resemblance between this and the topo is going to the devil.
166:13:23|T|LMP|I'll tell you. It sure is. Okay; we're going downslope now, Tony.  about a 5-degree slope, and we're going to go down perhaps 50 or 60 meters before we start climbing back out again towards Palmetto.  And up around North Ray, we see two tremendous blocks at about Station 11 and 12 that appear to be black in color. Black with white spots. And we're just about out of the ray material now. We only see a few cobbles left.
166:14:02|C|Eng|Okay. It might be a good idea to try to get there for our Station 11.
166:14:10|T|LMP|those two big - big rocks.
166:14:14|C|Eng|Good show.
166:14:15|T|LMP|It's right up on that ridge.  That might be - That's Palmetto right there, I guess, off to the left there, isn't it, John? Course, we've only been 0.6 though. Tony, we're at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">195 at 0.6</a>, and there's a big depression off to our 2 o'clock position on a heading of 030, with some white boulders on the inner rim. It's a very subdued feature, but it does have stuff, at least around the rim - The south rim - Wow! Great!
166:14:52|T|CDR|all right, Charlie.
166:14:53|T|LMP|The east side is a very shallow slope into this pit.
166:14:57|T|CDR|How far are we supposed to go this way before we turn back?
166:15:01|T|LMP|Just keep going. Straight out.
166:15:08|C|Eng|You should be heading of about 356.
166:15:09|T|LMP|turn -  Yeah. Now - At 0.8, you can turn to about 356.
166:15:18|T|CDR|Okay.
166:15:20|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, this big depression off to the left that I was describing - on the east side it's a very shallow slope into it, about 4 or 5 degrees. But, on the far end, the west side and the southwest side, it has very steep walls, 20 degrees or so
166:15:36|T|CDR|-
166:15:37|C|Eng|Right. Understand. You're looking right at the base of Turtle Mountain.
166:15:38|T|LMP|piece of cake, John.  Okay.
166:15:46|T|CDR|Listen, Houston.  I hate to tell you this, but these mountains don't look the same .
166:15:53|T|LMP|Which mountain? Those straight -
166:15:57|T|CDR|Where's Turtle Mountain. Right here?
166:15:58|T|LMP|It's off to the left, way off to the left. We just passed it. We could do a 360 and get a pan of it.
166:16:03|T|CDR|How about that rock there, Charlie?
166:16:09|T|CDR|Yeah. Look at the size of it.
166:16:13|T|LMP|Oh, this big one coming up, you mean?
166:16:15|T|CDR|Yeah.
166:16:16|T|LMP|Yeah.
166:16:19|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, it seems to me this is a more subdued surface over here than going towards South Ray. Not as many craters. It's almost - Except for three or four meter-sized craters, it's all subdued and just hummocky and rolling.
166:16:37|T|CDR|Yeah, that's true. It's much better driving. We're doing 10 clicks.
166:16:41|C|Eng|Outstanding.
166:16:43|C|Eng|Could we have an Amp reading?
166:16:51|T|LMP|Twenty . Hey, there's about a 4-meter boulder off to our - With a good fillet -
166:16:59|T|CDR|Oh, that's nice. That's been there for a while.
166:17:01|T|LMP|- we're just passing at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">195 at 0.9</a>. It's rounded.
166:17:04|C|Eng|Okay. How are we doing now on the rounded versus the angular boulders?
166:17:08|T|LMP|And we can see into Ravine - Okay; most of them over here are, I'd say, probably a good half and half. Rounded to angular.
166:17:25|C|Eng|Okay.
166:17:28|T|LMP|There are some small, indurated secondary craters. And as we approach <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267-s.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">Palmetto</a>, the boulder population is beginning to pick back up.
166:17:43|T|CDR|This Palmetto right here, Charlie?
166:17:44|T|LMP|Yes, it is. We've got to - I think it is, John. Yeah, right up there to the left. We've been - I think that's 1.1, and we're not quite there yet. We've got to go on this heading for - Okay, Tony, as you look to the northeast, you get a spectacular terrain view of rolling hills occasionally pock-marked with large boulders. The craters are very subdued, and the hills almost appear smooth, off to the northeast. Occasional craters -
166:18:31|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, and -
166:18:32|T|LMP|- That might be a function of the Sun angle, though.
166:18:34|C|Eng|- according to our track, you're a little bit east of - correction, west - of course, and probably a 005 heading would take you right along the rim of Palmetto.
166:18:41|T|CDR|Yeah. That's what I figure.
166:18:50|T|CDR|You're right, Charlie.
166:18:51|T|LMP|There it is.
166:18:53|T|CDR|There it is. Beautiful.
166:18:57|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, we topped out on the rim of Palmetto, and hit it right on the nose at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">1.2 at 189</a>.
166:19:06|T|LMP|And it's a tremendous crater. The walls to the south - south - northeast - correction, northwest - south - Wow!
166:19:17|T|CDR|Sorry, Charlie.
166:19:20|T|LMP|Beautiful. That's great.
166:19:21|T|CDR|I got to keep my eye on the driving.
166:19:23|T|LMP|That's great. And to the southeast here are steeper than the walls to the northeast. Apparently, it looks like it's almost breached to the northeast.
166:19:34|C|Eng|Okay.
166:19:42|T|LMP|John's cutting away from the rim now, because it's a little bit easier going.
166:19:47|T|LMP|There's a good ejecta blanket of half-meter-size boulders around the rim of Palmetto into some of these secondary craters here.
166:19:58|C|Eng|Okay. Do you have an estimate of the coverage ?
166:20:00|T|CDR|Palmetto is as big as Meteor , isn't it? It's -
166:20:06|T|LMP|Okay; of cobble size - in my usual size of being cobbles - I'd say 30 40 percent of the surface . Let's make it 30 percent; and the half-meter size, maybe one for every 10 square meters.
166:20:25|C|Eng|Okay.
166:20:27|T|CDR|Okay. We're just traveling right around the - We're traveling about 100 meters inside the rim, and we're at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">195, 1.4</a> now.
166:20:38|C|Eng|Okay.
166:20:39|T|CDR|1.7 is the distance.
166:20:44|T|LMP|Okay; and to the northeast, Tony - northwest, correction - you can see large blocks on the rim on the -
166:20:52|T|CDR|Hey, Charlie, there's Dot.
166:21:11|C|Eng|Okay.  Understand they're angular?
166:21:21|T|LMP|Angularity is sort of rounded.
166:21:24|C|Eng|Okay.
166:21:47|T|CDR|No, not too bad. It's not near as bad as Stone Mountain.
166:21:52|T|LMP|Okay. The boulder field out of North Ray does not reach Ravine, Tony. It stops on the outer flank of Ravine about a tenth of a crater diameter away.
166:22:05|C|Eng|Okay.
166:22:36|C|Eng|Outstanding.
166:22:38|T|LMP|Palmetto has a very definite raised rim to it, and we're going to be going off the rim down probably a 5- to 10-degree slope into a valley before we start climbing up to North Ray.
166:22:57|T|CDR|That's a real valley, too, Charlie.
166:22:58|T|LMP|Yeah. I'll say. And these valleys in here, Tony, tend to trend towards Big Sag.
166:23:09|C|Eng|And Charlie, could you go ahead and -
166:23:10|T|CDR|Hey, see Cat ?
166:23:11|C|Eng|- put that DAC on that?
166:23:12|T|LMP|Yeah, there's -
166:23:15|T|CDR|Yeah, put it on now, Charlie.
166:23:16|T|LMP|Okay. Wait a minute.  Okay; it's running.
166:23:26|C|Eng|Good show.
166:23:28|T|CDR|It's not pointing up -
166:23:30|T|LMP|And I got it pointed off to the right - or left. Excuse me.
166:23:34|C|Eng|Your other right.
166:23:35|T|LMP|Okay. We're now in an area, Tony, that's at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">195 at 1.9</a>, that is about a half-meter-size boulder every 5-meter square.
166:24:25|C|Eng|Okay.
166:24:36|T|LMP|What do you say? We're going down a 5-degree slope here or 10?
166:24:41|T|CDR|Yeah, Charlie; 5 to 10. More like 10.
166:24:43|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay, Tony. We're about maybe a half a crater diameter to the northeast of Palmetto, about a 10-degree slope, and the boulder population is about 5 degrees here. And the small cobbles have just about disappeared. Very smooth regolith, except for these 20- to 30-centimeter boulders, which are not very numerous. We're really moving out, downslope, at about 12, 15 kilometers an hour.
166:25:27|C|Eng|Okay.
166:25:29|T|LMP|It's remarkable how subdued all these craters are. It's almost a smooth plain except for a few of the 5-meter craters or so. The 1-meter size, and all, and smaller, are just about gone. Apparently. Very subdued.  Okay. John, we're at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">2.2 at 195</a>. We'll swing the camera around toward the Sun.  It's looking off to the right now.
166:26:14|T|CDR|Let's get a better heading here from 2.2 to 195, Houston.
166:26:18|C|Eng|Okay.
166:26:22|T|LMP|Okay. End Crater was 2.1. You should - What they want is about - Just directly north, John.
166:26:26|T|CDR|Forward?
166:26:27|T|LMP|Yeah. It looks great to me, that heading.
166:26:29|T|CDR|Yeah. It looks like - Well, we're down to about where the rock population is almost nonexistent. I hope it stays that way for a while.
166:26:38|T|LMP|It is.
166:26:39|C|Eng|Y'all are making some outstanding time there.
166:26:40|T|LMP|It's really easy going, Tony.  Well, he's got it full blower at 11 clicks, and we're just going over an undulating terrain. The ridge lines here predominantly trend east-west, and they are about 5 meters in relief. And really, the only significant craters that you have out here are the ones that are 5 meters and larger, and they only maybe cover 30 percent of the surface. Look at that view!
166:27:19|T|CDR|Look at those boulders !
166:27:20|T|LMP|Look at those rocks! Tony, there are some tremendous boulders on North Ray, and they get bigger as we go nearer them.
166:27:27|C|Eng|Okay.
166:27:28|T|CDR|Tell you one reason why North Ray looks like in the photos, it had such steep walls on one side, is because the rim is raised on one side higher than the other. Don't you get that impression. Charlie?
166:27:41|T|LMP|Yeah. Sure do.
166:27:45|C|Eng|Do you think you'll be able to recognize the edge of the continuous ejecta blanket?
166:27:48|T|LMP|Hey, John, it looks like -  Well, we'll give you a try at that. Right now, I can't -
166:27:59|T|CDR|I think we're starting to get into it right now, Charlie.
166:28:25|T|LMP|John, I think it looks like those - See that white boulder dead ahead? Looks like the greatest variety of boulders is going to be over there. But that's farther east and our Station 11, or farther north than Station 11 is called for. It's almost at the foot of Smoky.
166:28:43|T|CDR|- Let's go up on the rim and see what we've got up here?
166:28:48|T|LMP|Okay. I'd love to.
166:28:51|C|Eng|Okay; and you may get a caution flag on Battery 2 temperature -
166:28:53|T|LMP|Okay, Tony -
166:28:54|C|Eng|- just reset it, and press on.
166:29:00|T|CDR|Understand. Reset and press.
166:29:04|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, in this area now for <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">192 at 2.7</a>, we're getting in a greater frequency of 1-meter-size craters, and it's making it a little bit bumpier ride.
166:29:16|C|Eng|Okay. You might watch for a change in soil -
166:29:18|T|CDR|Okay. The Battery 2 temperature is reading what? You can read that, can't you, Charlie?
166:29:20|C|Eng|- color, or albedo as you go along there .
166:29:24|T|CDR|That's what we're watching for, and the real change comes up - Oh, man.
166:29:32|T|LMP|Uh-oh. Oh, man.
166:29:33|T|CDR|a little closer to the - That was -
166:30:01|T|CDR|-
166:30:02|T|LMP|Okay.
166:30:05|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, now that we get over here and can see down off the flank of North Ray, we can see good boulder rays out of North Ray that go for perhaps - I'm going to say a half-a-crater diameter. Boulders greater than a meter size.
166:30:24|C|Eng|Okay. Could you take a look up at Smoky area there, and see what kind of structure and texture you can see on the face?
166:30:34|T|LMP|Can't - been looking at that. Can't see anything except for a couple of rays of boulders out of North Ray that trend - One goes almost into Ravine that I described, and one goes on up to the top . In the northeast wall of Ravine, you can see the lineation. To the northeast, they're horizontal. To the north, they are dipping east about 30 degrees.
166:31:01|C|Eng|Okay. Can you push your camera up that far to get a picture of that?
166:31:16|T|LMP|No sweat.
166:31:33|T|CDR|Take a picture of that crater the road had us going through.
166:31:40|T|LMP|Oh, yeah. I did.
166:31:41|T|CDR|That's a nice one.
166:31:42|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, there's a - That, to me, looks like just a big sink feature, John. Tony, the road had us - the map had us going -
166:31:56|T|CDR|Okay. We're definitely in the regolith right now, Houston, because, see how these blocks are all laid in there?
166:32:03|T|LMP|Yeah, I do.
166:32:04|T|CDR|Remember how it was up at that crater? At Schooner .
166:32:09|T|LMP|Yeah.
166:32:10|T|CDR|Those rocks are laid into the ejecta blanket.
166:32:11|T|LMP|Yeah.
166:32:12|T|CDR|That's where they came from.
166:32:13|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">191, at 3.1</a>, we're coming into some good-sized whitish-looking rocks that are 3 and 4 meters across. They're fractured. And there's probably a permanent shadowed sample - No, that wouldn't be -
166:32:28|T|CDR|If you didn't know better, you'd say that they were bedrock outcrop, but they're just laid in there, I'm sure, from North Ray.
166:32:36|T|LMP|And as we go to the southeast side of North Ray, there is a big sink feature, a big pit, that's elongate east-west, and we could drive in it from the east. But once you get to the south of South Ray , it is really a deep pit, Tony. And that ridge line that we saw from the LM is on the west side of that deep pit. It's probably 100 meters below the rim of North Ray. Over.
166:33:15|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. And on the boulders you are looking at now that you think might be thrown in, you might talk about the fillet size away and towards the crater and see if that corresponds with the secondary.
166:33:32|T|LMP|Okay. Well, we - Okay. We're not close to any of them right now. We're in a very smooth area. At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">3.4, at 190</a>, we're down in this area where I've just described it, that goes into that big pit off to our west.
166:33:52|C|Eng|Understand.
166:33:54|T|LMP|About a crater diameter from North Ray off to the east, I see some 3-meter boulders that are all rounded and sitting in the ejecta with - or, in the regolith - with good fillets. Okay. Now here's one, Tony, off to the right -
166:34:17|T|LMP|- at 34. It did?
166:34:18|T|CDR|Yeah.
166:34:19|T|LMP|That's not supposed to happen. Okay. That's a 2-meter-size boulder with a fillet that looks like sort of equi-dimensional around the boulder. -
166:34:35|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
166:34:37|T|LMP|- Equal height , I should say.
166:34:39|C|Eng|Do you see any clasts in these boulders?
166:34:40|T|LMP|We're just passed another 1 meter -
166:34:42|T|CDR|-
166:34:43|T|LMP|They just look whitish to me.
166:34:45|C|Eng|Okay.
166:34:46|T|LMP|But that was another one we just passed, 1-meter size, that had the biggest fillet upslope .
166:34:51|T|CDR|Here's a new crater right there, Charlie.
166:34:53|T|LMP|Right to the right?
166:34:54|T|CDR|Yeah.
166:34:55|T|LMP|Yeah, I know it. Tony, these craters that we call secondary, that are indurated, I frankly think are very, very fresh craters, because it looks very cloddy around them, and the other ones that are secondaries do not appear that way. Over.
166:35:16|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
166:35:17|T|CDR|Yeah, I'm not sure that this isn't such an old crater, that the secondaries aren't eroded down. We've really got good going right here.
166:35:25|T|LMP|Yeah.
166:35:27|T|CDR|Now, before we get too far along, let's study this thing and see if we can figure out a way to get up that rim without going through all the boulders in the world -
166:35:34|T|LMP|Okay, John. See that big one off to the right over there?
166:35:38|T|CDR|Yeah. I see that.
166:35:39|T|LMP|Okay. I think up that slope looks to me to be the best. Of course, it might be straight ahead might be best.
166:35:45|T|CDR|Well, I don't see any rocks straight ahead.
166:35:46|T|LMP|All right. Let's go -
166:35:47|T|CDR|Let's try straight ahead.
166:35:47|T|LMP|straight ahead.
166:36:21|C|Eng|Okay.
166:36:22|T|CDR|That is a beauty, isn't it?
166:36:22|C|Eng|- We'll keep that in mind on the way back. Give us bearing and range again.
166:36:23|T|LMP|Yeah. See that white one over there, John?
166:36:53|C|Eng|This sounds really great.
166:36:58|T|LMP|Man, that is a big rock!
166:37:02|T|CDR|Yeah.
166:37:04|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. They're are not any house-size rocks, but the biggest ones are maybe 5 meters.  And it 's really smooth except for these big rocks out here. It's smooth going.
166:37:22|T|CDR|Why don't you leave the -
166:37:23|T|LMP|There's a real fresh little crater right there. See the rays -
166:37:25|T|CDR|Yeah.
166:37:26|T|LMP|- off to the left?
166:37:27|T|CDR|Yep.
166:37:28|T|LMP|It's about a meter size.
166:37:29|C|Eng|Hey, could you use a couple more words -
166:37:30|T|LMP|And <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">3.9, we're at 183</a>.
166:37:31|C|Eng|- to describe that frothy rock?
166:37:38|T|LMP|It's got a hackly surface to it -
166:37:41|T|CDR|It's black colored. Right, Charlie?
166:37:44|T|LMP|Yeah.
166:37:46|T|CDR|Okay; we're going up a pretty steep slope right now, Houston. We're doing - I think we're almost at the rim, Charlie.
166:37:54|T|LMP|Yeah, we are. Looks like we're just about 20 meters from the rim.
166:37:59|T|CDR|I'm going to slow down here.
166:38:01|T|LMP|Yeah.  You think you'll be alright. How about hooking a right, over here, John.
166:38:10|C|Eng|We got you at about 400 or 500 meters from it yet.
166:38:11|T|LMP|Tony, coming to the rim -  I don't believe it, but -
166:38:23|C|Eng|Okay; we'd like you -
166:38:24|T|LMP|Well, you might be right.
166:38:25|C|Eng|- to go to 12 frames per second .
166:38:29|T|LMP|Okay. You got it.
166:38:34|C|Eng|Okay. This is going to make some great pictures.
166:38:45|T|LMP|Okay. The rocks here, Tony, are all rounded. Well, most of them. Seventy percent of them are rounded, and the other ones are subangular , mostly dust covered, grayish in color. The big rocks are not on the rim, Tony! The big rocks are farther away from the rim. At least, we can't see any big rocks as we approach the rim, but we're still climbing upslope.
166:39:11|C|Eng|Okay.
166:39:21|T|LMP|There's a fresh crater, really fresh one, that has a white interior that's punched in about 2 meters deep, and that was at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">181 at 4.0</a>.
166:39:41|T|LMP|Okay; it looks like to me we're - The rim - Hey, there's some beautiful white ones over there -
166:39:49|T|CDR|There we go, Charlie.
166:39:50|T|LMP|- John, at 2 o'clock. Think this is the rim, right here?
166:39:56|C|Eng|We still think you're about 500 meters from the rim.
166:39:59|T|LMP|We'll be able to sample these white ones. Here's some -  We are. There's the rim up there.
166:40:07|T|CDR|Sure is.
166:40:11|T|LMP|Sure is, Tony. You were right. We just climbed - What we thought was the rim of one of these little hummocks.
166:40:17|C|Eng|Right -
166:40:18|T|LMP|Little hummocks! It was a pretty steep hummock.
166:40:20|C|Eng|- Just like mountain climbing, there's always another ridge.
166:40:25|T|CDR|I'll be darned!
166:40:27|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to pan the DAC around to get to that boulder field that goes up to Smoky Mountain. It's really tremendous. The boulders are very angular over there. They're dark gray in color, and some of them are almost solid white. The most unique ones appear to be solid white. Up on the rim here, they appear to be almost white; none of the dark ones.  And we're at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">180 at 4.1</a>. Smooth regolith.
166:41:08|T|LMP|John, the rim's left.
166:41:09|T|CDR|The rim is right there!
166:41:10|T|LMP|No, sir. I bet it's over there to the left where those rocks are. But you might be right.  That's too far away. You're right. That's probably too far west.
166:41:22|C|Eng|We think the most direct route from where you are -
166:41:23|T|CDR|Okay; we're at one-eighty at four point -
166:41:24|C|Eng|- to the rim would be about a heading of 350.
166:41:33|T|LMP|Okay! We're headed that way. And there's some beautiful - Those white rocks are -
166:41:40|T|CDR|Right on the rim, Charlie!
166:41:41|T|LMP|- right on the rim.
166:41:42|C|Eng|Outstanding. Can you see on around to see if there are any black rocks around at 3 o'clock in the crater?
166:41:51|T|LMP|Well, we can't see in the crater. But around at the 3 o'clock position, yeah, there's a biggie. The biggest one , Tony, is this 10- to 15-meter boulder that is on the rim; and it's blackish.
166:42:04|C|Eng|Okay. Is there any chance of working around towards that contact? And if we could get both the white and black in one stop, that would be really fine.
166:42:15|T|CDR|It's - No way!
166:42:17|C|Eng|Okay.
166:42:18|T|LMP|Right. Pretty far. I think we can do it with a short stop over there. And when we get up there, Tony, we might be able to find a black rock.
166:42:27|C|Eng|Okay. Fine
166:42:28|T|LMP|Okay. We're going through a - We're definitely on the ejecta blanket here. And, oh, within 100 meters or so, I think, of the rim.
166:42:43|C|Eng|Right. We have you about 100 meters from it -
166:42:44|T|LMP|These rocks are just white! Crystalline, white looking.  Man, you guys are right on. If we copied, I think y'all are right on.
166:42:56|T|CDR|Yeah. We're <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">179 at 4.4</a> right now.
166:43:00|T|LMP|Okay. That's great, John.   he wants us to park 360 . Go right the rim! Okay; that's a breccia. That white one's a breccia.
166:43:20|T|CDR|There's the rim.
166:43:22|T|LMP|Yeah. There it is. Okay. I think we can get over there and maybe get them a picture. We're headed about 360, aren't we?
166:43:31|T|CDR|Yep.
166:43:33|T|LMP|That is - That big - I can't believe the size of that big black rock over here. And I don't think that's a breccia, John, because - Although it might be. I see some large white clasts.
166:43:48|T|LMP|Oh, spectacular! Just spectacular! Can -
166:43:56|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie.
166:43:58|C|Eng|Charlie, the DAC should be out of film; you can turn it off.
166:44:04|T|LMP|I can't reach it.
166:44:05|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
166:44:09|T|CDR|I don't - No, I guess not.  What I'd like to do is park where it's flat, and -
166:44:46|C|Eng|Beautiful.
166:44:50|T|LMP|There we go. If we go 360 and park right here, it'll be flat.  Great, John. Super!  Can't wait to get off. Got to get off.
166:45:08|C|Eng|We can't wait for you to either. You're -
166:45:09|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're at -
166:45:10|C|Eng|- about 17 minutes ahead of the timeline.
166:45:43|C|Eng|Okay. What was that temperature on Battery 1 again?
166:45:45|T|CDR|Okay. Primary is going to Off.
166:45:49|T|LMP|100 and - About 110, I think.
166:45:52|C|Eng|Okay. Got it. And, Charlie, we'll need a frame count.
166:45:58|T|LMP|Okay. Pan -  Okay; stand by. I'm so dusty .
166:46:18|T|LMP|Gee, I don't know, Tony. I can't read it. Let John read it. John.
166:46:23|T|CDR|What's that?
166:46:25|T|LMP|Read my frame count.
166:46:28|T|CDR|Okay. Hold still.
166:46:29|T|LMP|Well, I wanted to get in the Sun so you could read it.
166:46:31|T|CDR|165. You better change that out.
166:46:33|T|LMP|Okay. Took 165 pictures coming up here, Tony.
166:46:37|C|Eng|Okay; and we concur on the changeout.
166:46:44|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to put another black and white on. Kilo.
166:46:54|C|Eng|Okay. Kilo.
166:46:57|T|CDR|Man, look at -  Okay, I'm walking down about a -
166:47:05|T|LMP|John, I'll get the TV for you.
166:47:07|C|Eng|Okay; and DAC off.
166:47:08|T|CDR|Charlie, I'll get the TV.
166:47:12|T|LMP|Yeah, okay.
166:47:14|T|CDR|Man, does this thing have steep walls.
166:47:16|T|LMP|They said 60 degrees.
166:47:18|T|CDR|Now, I tell you, I can't see to the bottom of it, and I'm just as close to the edge as I'm going to get.  That's the truth.
166:47:30|T|LMP|Okay, going to 2 .
166:47:44|C|Eng|Okay. Our plan here is to range along the edge of the crater for about 80 meters, if you can do that. And, Charlie, if you'll start out with your pan 1, then the 500 millimeter. We'd also like you to shoot some more pictures of Smoky with the 500, and then take your far field stereo. And then if you range on out as far as you can go, taking the 500 millimeter with you, take - and John with you - take a stereo of the inside of the crater with the 500 millimeter from as far away from the Rover as you can get. And then stick the 500 millimeter in John's SCB, and then do your other far-field polarimetry, and then, from then on, all we've got is sampling.
166:48:41|T|CDR|Okay. I think we probably ought to take all those things one at a time.
166:48:45|T|LMP|I do too.
166:48:46|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
166:48:48|T|LMP|Okay. Do you want me to start out with the 500?
166:48:50|C|Eng|Right. Go ahead and start out with your 500.
166:48:52|T|LMP|Okay. You say, I start out with the 500?  Okay. Okay, Tony; I have magazine Kilo frame count 1, I think, it was.
166:49:13|T|LMP|Okay. Those rocks you're looking at now, Tony, are white and they look breccious to me. The big black one is off behind the TV. And you're going towards the rim on the crater right now .
166:49:34|T|CDR|The unfortunate thing about it, Houston, is that rascally rim - It goes down - It slopes into it about, say, 10 or 15 degrees, which is the kind of slope I'm standing on right now; and then, all of a sudden, in order to see to the bottom, I've got to walk another 100 yards down a 25- to 30-degree slope, and I don't think I'd better. Maybe we can drive around to the other side and see down into it.
166:50:13|C|Eng|Man, is that a hole in the ground!
166:50:14|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The inside -  It really is. I see no bedrock, though. All I see is boulders around the crater. There's nothing that reminds me of bedding, just loose boulders. Though it might very well be that it's so shocked that there could be real boulders - I mean, real bedrock there.
166:50:37|T|CDR|Now, the layering, the boulder layers are horizontally oriented; and, of course, they are all covered with talus. Over on the north wall, in particular, about 1/3 of the way from the top is a line of boulders that you probably ought to be able to see on the TV. But they're all oriented right in that line, which would lead one to think that it has bedding there. Don't you see that line right over there, Charlie?
166:51:11|T|LMP|I don't - I'm worrying about trying to get this crazy camera going here.
166:51:17|T|CDR|Okay. And the -
166:51:24|C|Eng|Okay -
166:51:24|T|CDR|The material is just completely different - The wall -
166:51:25|C|Eng|- That line of boulders on the north wall, what color were they?
166:51:30|T|CDR|In this light, they appear to be dark boulders.
166:51:36|C|Eng|Okay. Incidentally, the white rocks you see there. Do they look like the Cone-Crater-type white rocks?
166:51:48|T|LMP|No, not to me.
166:51:51|C|Eng|Okay.
166:51:55|T|CDR|Better let me get a piece of one, Charlie. I don't think - This is definitely a breccia right here, a big foot-and-a-half breccia. It's a white matrix with dark clasts, and it looks to be a three-rock breccia. Some of the dark clasts have even darker clasts than those.
166:52:29|C|Eng|Okay.
166:52:30|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, I just picked up a grab sample of a breccia. It's very friable. It looks shocked; it has black clasts in it, black clasts a couple of millimeters across.  It's so worn down that you know what it really looks like? It looks like a - If I can use the analogy, I'm not sure what the heck it is. It looks like a tuff. It just looks like a rock with a - You see, the clasts are sticking out of it, is what I'm saying.
166:53:24|T|LMP|you say you want Smoky or Stone Mountain?
166:53:29|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like some more pictures of Smoky.
166:53:38|T|LMP|Okay.
166:53:41|C|Eng|And, John, -
166:53:43|T|LMP|Get up here where I can see it .
166:53:43|C|Eng|- in your mineral description there, could you see a crystal shape?
166:53:46|T|CDR|&quot;Can I see a crystal shape?&quot; I saw one clast. One - No.  Well, the clasts in there are very angular. Maybe that's a zap crater; that's probably what that is.
166:54:07|T|CDR|I don't see in the - The white matrix doesn't have any crystalline structure that I can recognize.
166:54:17|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
166:54:35|C|Eng|And, Charlie, verify that you turned the DAC off.
166:54:37|T|CDR|Now, Tony, what is it you want me to do here?
166:54:41|T|LMP|Yeah, I think so. I'll check again.
166:54:44|C|Eng|Okay. After the 500 millimeter -
166:54:45|T|CDR|What is it you want me to do here, Tony?
166:54:59|C|Eng|And, John, we'd like you to start ranging out in the best traverse direction for about 80 meters, if you can go that far. And survey the area as you go out, and Charlie will follow you along, and then sample as you come back.
166:55:17|T|CDR|Okay. That'll be 80 meters to the northeast, here .
166:55:22|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
166:55:23|T|CDR|no problem to do that, and -
166:55:29|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Pan is complete; and I'm up to 165 on magazine Mike.
166:55:38|T|LMP|Sixty percent of it is covered with boulders up to 3 meters. Make that 50 percent of it on the interior; we cannot see the bottom.
166:55:56|T|LMP|The boulders are splayed out from the center in rays that about every eighth to a quarter of a crater - you have a definite ray.
166:56:10|C|Eng|Okay. And, John, did you get a bag number on that ?
166:56:12|T|LMP|You still want me to take the 500 ?
166:56:16|T|CDR|Oh, yeah. Excuse me. It's 373, I think.
166:56:20|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that.
166:56:21|T|CDR|It's in the bottom of SCB-7. Anyway, I can identify that rock for you.
166:56:25|C|Eng|Okay, that's fine.  Yeah, Charlie. After your 500 millimeter -
166:56:28|T|LMP|Tony, do you still want me to get -
166:56:31|C|Eng|- after your 500 millimeter, do the far field pan and the three polarizer settings of the far side of the crater. And then when you follow John along, take the 500 millimeter with you.
166:56:45|T|CDR|Okay. You want me to help Tony to get - I mean Charlie - to get the rocks? You want to get the near-field first, Charlie?
166:56:52|T|LMP|We're not doing it.
166:56:53|C|Eng|We're not doing a near field.
166:56:55|T|CDR|We're not going to do that. Okay.
166:56:56|T|LMP|Yeah, okay.
166:56:59|T|LMP|Okay; John, I'm going to bring a sample bag with that 500 millimeter in it, so we won't -
166:57:04|T|CDR|Okay, I've got a sample bag, , here.
166:57:25|C|Eng|Okay. You're starting in the Right position?
166:57:28|T|LMP|Ah.  Yeah, I'm starting in the Right position. I've got f/6, 1/25, at 74 . And I'll do a partial pan with each setting. It's going to be about an eight-picture pan.
166:57:46|C|Eng|Okay, good show.
166:57:51|T|LMP|Man, I wish I could see the bottom of this beauty.
166:57:55|T|CDR|Did I drop my bags, Charlie?
166:57:57|T|LMP|Yeah, you dropped your bags; I thought you dropped them off the Rover.
166:58:31|C|Eng|Sorry, John. Didn't see it.
166:58:40|T|CDR|God damn it!
166:58:48|T|LMP|Tony, we can look out at my 12 o'clock position here, I can look down and see a large block that's on this inner flank here that I can't -
166:59:02|C|Eng|John, is there still something behind you?
166:59:03|T|LMP|It's dust covered, and I can't tell you what type it is.
166:59:09|T|CDR|Huh?
166:59:10|C|Eng|We thought we saw something still lying there -
166:59:12|T|CDR|
166:59:13|C|Eng|- where you fell over. Okay.
166:59:27|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Magazine Kilo; I'm up to 40 with the -
166:59:30|C|Eng|Okay.
166:59:31|T|LMP|- with the far field pans.
166:59:34|C|Eng|Okay, very good -
166:59:42|C|Eng|That's right. We'd like you to leave the polarizer on and take the 500 millimeter with you, also; and then range out your 80 meters. You can either take a SCB -
166:59:52|T|LMP|Okay. We're gonna range -
167:00:01|T|LMP|We'll take one.
167:00:02|C|Eng|Okay -
167:00:03|T|CDR|I've got one, Charlie.
167:00:04|T|LMP|Okay; yours fell off - Where's yours that was on your back?
167:00:14|T|CDR|Oh, it fell off en route.
167:00:24|C|Eng|Okay.
167:00:25|T|CDR|Probably get it on the way back, Charlie.
167:00:44|T|CDR|Okay.
167:00:46|T|LMP|Okay. Have you got - I'm going to get the shovel.  Tony, are you going to want a rake sample along the rim here?
167:00:58|T|CDR|Yeah, let's do that now -
167:00:59|C|Eng|No. Let's go get the polarizer first and -
167:01:00|T|CDR|
167:01:01|T|LMP|Okay.
167:01:02|C|Eng|- polarizing pictures yet, and we'll do the sampling on the way back.
167:01:10|T|CDR|This is about as far as I'd like to go.
167:01:14|T|LMP|That's about 80 meters, John. Man, are we dusty.
167:01:19|T|CDR|And I can't see the bottom of the crater though.
167:01:20|T|LMP|I know it. That's a shame.  You see that big rock beyond John, Tony?
167:01:28|C|Eng|Yeah, we sure do. How about rolling that one over?
167:01:33|T|LMP|No way.
167:02:02|T|LMP|Okay.
167:02:10|T|LMP|Okay; Tony, right under the upper dull-gray soil, there's a layer of a whitish material much like was in South Ray.
167:02:25|C|Eng|Okay.
167:02:26|T|LMP|Yeah. I'll go over and - There's the shovel you can use to pick that up with, John.
167:02:29|T|CDR|Okay.
167:02:43|C|Eng|Good show.
167:02:46|T|LMP|Maybe only 50 - Let me move down a little bit farther.
167:02:49|T|CDR|Okay. Charlie, don't back into nothing around here.
167:03:13|T|LMP|Okay. Starting the pan in the Right position, Tony.
167:03:15|C|Eng|Okay.
167:03:17|T|LMP|From right to left.
167:05:08|T|LMP|I'm up to 80. Do you want a 500 from here also, Tony?
167:05:11|C|Eng|Right, sure do. You probably have 20 or 25 pictures left in that 500, so maybe that'll give you the entire inside of the crater there.  We'll just shoot up the rest of the roll in there.
167:05:23|T|LMP|Okay.
167:05:27|T|LMP|Okay.
167:05:34|C|Eng|And if you're through with your far field, you can just throw that polarizer away.
167:05:40|T|CDR|God damn it.
167:05:55|C|Eng|Okay; and O2 ?
167:06:01|T|LMP|I think about 75 percent, but it's so dusty I can't read it right now, Tony.
167:06:04|C|Eng|Okay.
167:06:09|T|CDR|Yeah. I can't see mine either, Houston. Can y'all see it down there?
167:06:14|C|Eng|Right. We've got about 67 percent -
167:06:16|T|CDR|I'm reading 3.85 , I'm in Intermediate cooling.  Okay. When you get dust on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="alsj">RCU</a>, you cannot read the O2 quantity.
167:06:37|C|Eng|Okay, you are all doing fine down here.
167:06:56|C|Eng|Okay. How much of the inside did you get?
167:07:02|T|LMP|Oh, I got one partial pan of about three-quarters of the way up of the entire wall, and then almost two vertical rays.
167:07:16|C|Eng|Okay, we understand.
167:07:17|T|LMP|Before I ran out.
167:07:31|T|LMP|Guess what, John?
167:07:33|T|CDR|What's that, Charlie?
167:07:34|T|LMP|My bags fell off somewhere.
167:07:40|T|CDR|Well, I've got mine hooked over my little finger.  fall off from there.
167:07:54|T|LMP|Look at this rock right here, John. Pure white.
167:07:59|T|CDR|-
167:08:37|T|LMP|Okay. The polarizing filter's coming off . I hope.
167:08:42|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. And we'll just call that the end of the 500 millimeter.
167:08:48|T|LMP|Okay. Sorry I ran out of film there. I thought I had plenty.
167:08:54|C|Eng|Oh, that's all right!
167:09:00|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm going back towards Min in cooling. I'm getting a little frosty.
167:09:09|C|Eng|Okay.
167:09:54|C|Eng|Okay, understand.
167:09:55|C|Eng|How large are the clasts?
167:09:56|T|CDR|You remember that one, Houston?
167:09:57|C|Eng|Rog. I remember.
167:09:59|C|Eng|Is this black breccia frothy, too, ?
167:10:03|T|CDR|Three centimeters.  No, it's not frothy at all. It's dense.
167:10:08|C|Eng|Okay.
167:10:10|T|CDR|It could be a very dense, basalt-like rock. It is.
167:10:33|C|Eng|Okay.
167:10:36|T|CDR|At least it has a shocked appearance.
167:10:40|T|CDR|What did you do with the shovel, Charlie!?
167:10:42|T|LMP|I got it. I'm sorry. I thought you weren't using it. I was just going to get this one over here.
167:10:46|T|CDR|Okay.
167:10:47|T|LMP|Yeah. I finally got the polarizing filter off, Tony.
167:10:52|C|Eng|Okay.
167:10:55|T|LMP|Okay. Looking back from where we are, Tony, towards the west - south, rather - I can see South Ray.
167:11:07|T|CDR|I'd like to make sure we aren't overlooking something here, Charlie.
167:11:11|T|LMP|That's why I'd like to go on down to that black rock down there, John.
167:11:15|T|CDR|Yeah, - . You've really got your eye on, I can tell.
167:11:19|T|LMP|Big one.
167:11:25|T|CDR|Okay. Here's a small secondary up here on top of the rim. It's about a meter across, about a meter deep, and it has either very angular black glass or part of this black rock in total. And they must be  4 or 5 centimeters across in there, and I'll get one or two of those babies.
167:12:02|T|LMP|Hey, John. Can I get a bag from you?
167:12:04|T|CDR|Sure.  You took my gnomon .  You'll have to get the shadow for scaling, Houston.
167:12:15|C|Eng|Okay.
167:12:19|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I picked up that white -
167:12:25|T|CDR|I'll get it for you.
167:12:26|T|LMP|Thank you.  - that white shocked rock. It broke in two; there are two pieces of it.  partially documented - the &quot;befores&quot; anyway - in 384.
167:12:42|C|Eng|Okay, bag 384.
167:12:43|T|LMP|And I'm going back and get some bags.
167:12:50|T|CDR|Now I've got Charlie's shovel for scale for the &quot;before&quot; shooting.
167:12:02|T|CDR|You can almost get local vertical on the shovel because you have to balance it before it will stand up.
167:13:07|C|Eng|Okay.
167:13:31|C|Eng|Okay. Charlie, did you bring the 500 millimeter back with you?
167:13:36|T|LMP|see me coming?
167:13:38|C|Eng|No. We're pointed over at John -
167:13:40|T|LMP|It's in the bag.   Oh, okay. Hey, y'all must really be zoomed in then.
167:13:48|C|Eng|We sure are.
167:13:49|T|LMP|I'm just a few feet to the left of him .
167:14:05|T|LMP|Y'all didn't see any bags fall off anywhere, did you -
167:14:08|C|Eng|No, we didn't see them.
167:14:09|T|LMP|- with your big eye?
167:14:13|T|CDR|That -
167:14:14|C|Eng|There we've got you, Charlie.
167:14:15|T|CDR|The outer surface of that rock is dust covered. It appears to be a really black glass that's going into 385.
167:14:25|C|Eng|Okay, 385.
167:14:39|T|LMP|I can't believe it. What a spectacular view looking back to the east and to the south, Tony. Can see Baby Ray; way on past Kenesaw where there's a bright fresh crater down there on its flank.  Okay. I need to get some more bags, but I don't have a holder. My holder -
167:15:03|T|CDR|What really attracts me to this rock, even though it's dust covered, Houston, is the fact that it has right angles to it.
167:15:24|T|CDR|Or, it did before I picked it up.
167:15:30|C|Eng|Right. Remember those blocks up at Nevada Test Site? Up on the rim? They broke at right angles, too.
167:15:44|T|CDR|Okay; this next one that's going in - It is so dust covered after I picked it up and dropped it into the dirt, I can't describe it to you; other than to say it's dust covered. It's going into bag 386.
167:15:56|C|Eng|Okay, 386.
167:16:01|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The 500 is complete. What do you want me to do now?
167:16:05|C|Eng|Just go back and sample. We'd like big boulder samples, and look for that - Well, I guess, we're just boulder sampling now.
167:16:16|T|LMP|Okay. I'd like to go up to the southwest around the rim in the other direction from John, and try my hand at these large white rocks.
167:16:28|T|CDR|Charlie, do you want to drive the - I don't think we can drive the Rover over to here.
167:16:31|T|LMP|No, I agree. That's not very much - I was just going up here a little bit, John, and do some flightline stereo of this 3-meter block up here.  Tony, some of these rocks are glass covered. They are all fractured.
167:16:59|C|Eng|Okay.
167:17:00|T|LMP|Very beat-up looking.
167:17:01|C|Eng|That's fine, Charlie, if you want to go down that way.
167:17:06|T|LMP|Okay, I'm going -
167:17:11|T|CDR|If you're gonna boulder sample, Charlie, I'd better come and help you.
167:17:14|T|LMP|No, I'm just going to whack - I'm not really going to do the true thing. I'll be down there to help you in a minute.
167:17:21|T|CDR|Yeah, let's - You want to go down to this big boulder down here?
167:17:32|C|Eng|John, how far away is that big boulder?
167:17:58|C|Eng|If you think you can work up there, it sounds like an awful good place to work.  Charlie, you just dropped your bags.
167:18:11|T|LMP|I know; it's empty. It didn't have a thing in it.
167:18:45|T|LMP|And it was hackley looking on the surface. That's why I stopped to get it.
167:18:51|C|Eng|Okay.
167:18:57|T|CDR|Charlie, we could probably get a pretty good cross section up here with just a rake sample.
167:19:01|T|LMP|Yeah, I agree.
167:19:30|C|Eng|Okay. If you see any clasts -
167:19:31|T|LMP|-
167:19:32|C|Eng|- or anything in it, a close-up might look good.
167:19:36|T|LMP|That's what I'm going to do.
167:19:37|C|Eng|Okay.
167:20:01|T|CDR|Charlie described this boulder right here to you. Did you describe this one with the black streak running through it?
167:20:09|T|LMP|No.
167:20:11|T|CDR|Boy, that is absolutely beautiful! It has a black fracture pattern running right through the middle of it. It's about six - It looks like a Sudbury breccia, and that's the truth. I can't believe it.
167:20:31|C|Eng|Good. Maybe we can get some of that.
167:20:33|T|CDR|
167:20:35|C|Eng|And, Charlie, while you're up at that boulder, if you can, get -
167:20:37|T|CDR|
167:20:38|C|Eng|- some of that fillet as well as the boulder.
167:20:50|C|Eng|Okay.
167:20:51|T|LMP|Be advised that -
167:20:53|T|LMP|just dropped the bags.
167:20:55|C|Eng|Rog. We saw.
167:21:01|T|CDR|Charlie, I think with these equipment problems, we'd better work together, and I'll handle one bag, and you handle the other bag, and be able to be more productive. Don't you?
167:21:10|T|LMP|Yeah. I guess you're right, John.
167:21:11|C|Eng|We concur.
167:21:19|T|CDR|Got a hammer?
167:21:20|T|LMP|Yeah, I got the hammer. Well it's this loose. The stuff is lying up there on the top.
167:21:30|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we'll fillet for you - sample for you up here.
167:21:39|T|CDR|Got a shovel?
167:21:40|T|LMP|Yeah, I - No, I don't have a shovel, but I got a hammer.
167:21:48|T|CDR|Well, I'm going to - I'll come up there and help you. We can do the rake sampling - - making - .
167:21:57|C|Eng|Charlie, if possible, we'd like to sample some of that stuff on top of the boulder. I think that's what you're going to do there.
167:22:03|T|LMP|What I'm going to do -  That's what I'm going to do.
167:22:07|C|Eng|Good show. You're about ten steps ahead of us.
167:22:13|T|LMP|I'm not going to give you any scale , though; it's just too - With our problems here, like John said, it's -
167:22:21|C|Eng|That's okay. If you bring it back, that will be enough scale.
167:22:27|T|LMP|Okay.
167:22:30|T|LMP|And it looks like it's the same thing that John has described. It's a friable breccia with a black clast, being aphanitic. The largest clast I see is, oh, not in this sample, but it's a black one that's a centimeter across. It has a bluish tint to it, Tony. It looks like all those shocked rocks that Fred H&ouml;rz was telling us about. Exactly. And that's in bag 4 - Wait a minute. 416.
167:23:19|C|Eng|Okay, 416. And from today's experience and yesterday's, it sounds like old Fred's briefings were pretty useful.
167:23:31|T|LMP|They turned out pretty good, I think.
167:23:35|T|CDR|Charlie, put that in my bag.
167:23:45|T|CDR|-
167:23:47|T|LMP|See, both of - We'll just use this one. Okay?
167:23:51|T|CDR|-
167:23:53|T|LMP|They want a fillet up here, John. Could we get a fillet up there where that gnomon is?  I'll get the cross-Sun.
167:24:02|T|CDR|Okay.
167:24:19|T|LMP|I thought I'd use my little finger as a bag holder.
167:24:27|T|LMP|Good. Okay; that fillet is 417. Tony.
167:24:33|C|Eng|Okay, 417.
167:24:36|T|LMP|Let me put it -
167:24:39|T|CDR|-
167:24:40|T|LMP|Huh?
167:24:43|T|CDR|Okay. I'll get the down-Sun here.
167:24:54|T|CDR|-
167:24:57|T|LMP|And you can almost -
167:24:58|T|CDR|Did you get the boulder off the top?
167:25:01|T|LMP|Yes, I did. I got that sample.
167:25:03|T|CDR|Okay; it's a multi-rock breccia. Boy!
167:25:09|T|LMP|The matrix is the white, though, Tony, with the black being the clasts.
167:25:15|T|CDR|Yeah. I see at least two different colors of light-dark clasts. Must be at least a three rocker.
167:25:27|C|Eng|Good show. You feel like you got all three ?
167:25:28|T|CDR|Let's get a rake sample, Charlie.
167:25:29|T|LMP|Okay; good idea, John.
167:25:51|T|CDR|Look at these rocks here that I just stepped on.
167:26:05|T|CDR|Okay.
167:26:06|T|LMP|I don't think we got any in that sample I got.  And the thing is so friable. Hey, I got it!
167:26:22|C|Eng|Very good.
167:26:24|C|Eng|While you're looking around up there, you might keep an eye out for a permanent shadow area and we'll go ahead and put it in a regular sample bag and forget the SESC.
167:27:11|T|LMP|It's going in 418.
167:27:13|C|Eng|Okay; 418. Sounds like a good one.
167:27:15|T|LMP|And that's a rock -  Yeah. I haven't seen a rock like that before in the Apollo samples.
167:27:38|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I have a rock here that is a fine , white crystalline rock. It's pretty well dust covered, but I don't see any - I do not see any clasts in it.
167:27:52|C|Eng|Okay.
167:28:16|T|LMP|Sorry we're working behind that big rock there, Tony, from the tube. John, why don't we get out -
167:28:24|C|Eng|That's okay -
167:28:25|T|LMP|- and do a rake sample. That way they can see us.
167:28:27|T|CDR|I think - .
167:28:29|T|LMP|Well, just anywhere we rake, we got a good sample.
167:28:34|T|CDR|Yeah. Charlie, let's get a -
167:28:41|T|LMP|Dadgummit. Do what, John?
167:28:48|T|CDR|Let's get a soil sample right here.
167:28:51|T|LMP|Okay.  Stick this -
167:28:53|T|LMP|Stick this -
167:28:54|T|CDR|I can get it with this.
167:28:56|T|LMP|Okay. You want to document it?
167:29:08|T|LMP|Boy, this equipment problem is really handicapping us.
167:29:24|T|LMP|Okay. There's a - Wow! Boy, the regolith here, Tony, up on this crater rim is really soft. We're sinking in on these slopes about 6 inches or so.
167:29:43|T|CDR|Okay.
167:29:46|T|LMP|Okay. Oh, I missed it. That's a good one. Okay. The soil sample here is 419.
167:29:55|T|CDR|Okay.
167:29:56|T|LMP|Okay. That's good.
167:30:04|T|CDR|We oughta rake some, here.
167:30:07|T|LMP|Let's get in a clear spot, John, to rake. Okay?
167:30:10|T|CDR|Well, we can do it down there, too.
167:30:11|T|LMP|Okay.  It looks almost fruitless up here.
167:30:14|T|LMP|Oh, no. There's some rocks.
167:30:18|T|CDR|Lot of rocks there, Charlie! One rake sample.
167:30:21|T|LMP|Okay. One rake sample right out here, Tony.
167:30:25|C|Eng|Sounds good.
167:30:27|T|LMP|You can see us on the tube.
167:30:28|C|Eng|That's fine.
167:30:29|T|LMP|It's going into 48 - It's going in 420.
167:30:33|C|Eng|Okay.
167:30:36|T|CDR|Just hold still.
167:30:39|T|LMP|Oh, he's got some nice ones there.
167:30:42|T|CDR|see what I'm doing.
167:30:45|T|LMP|That's it.
167:30:46|T|CDR|That got them in there?
167:30:47|T|LMP|Yep.
167:30:48|T|CDR|Amazing.
167:30:51|T|LMP|And so dust covered, I can't really see what they are. I can't believe all those bags dropped off.
167:31:02|T|LMP|Wait a minute; put that one in. Okay.
167:31:06|T|CDR|-
167:31:07|T|LMP|Where you want to go?
167:31:08|T|CDR|Go on back to -
167:31:09|T|LMP|Oh! I got it. I got it, John.
167:31:12|T|CDR|Let me get it -
167:31:17|T|LMP|save you some energy. It is hot out here.  Hey, here; give me my bag; I'll carry the bag.
167:31:35|T|LMP|Okay, Tony - Why don't we go down halfway , John, and do another rake sample; and then go down to the big, black rock?
167:31:43|T|CDR|All right.  Yeah.
167:32:05|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
167:32:08|T|CDR|I'm halfway between .
167:32:13|C|Eng|While you two are working together, you may be able to put the bag shoe into the core cap holder on the side of Charlie's PLSS. You won't be able to run that way, but, at least, it'll be some place to hang it while you're working.
167:32:29|T|LMP|Here, John, let me - I'll take this down, and we'll get down in this little hollow. If not, we'll use that for the gnomon. How's that for the rake sample? Okay?
167:32:41|T|CDR|Yeah. Let me see if I can stick my bag into your holder like -
167:32:44|T|CDR|Won't be able to ride with it that way, huh?
167:32:46|C|Eng|No, it'll probably pop out, but you can look at it.
167:32:49|T|LMP|I'll just keep it on my - [Stops to listen]
167:32:50|T|CDR|Keep it over your - Push it way up on your finger.
167:32:55|T|LMP|Yeah. If I push it up on my middle finger, it ain't going to fall off. I won't even know it's there.
167:33:01|C|Eng|Okay.
167:33:05|T|CDR|Okay; a cross-Sun here.
167:33:14|T|LMP|You got it.
167:33:25|T|LMP|John, have I still got my SCB on my back?
167:33:29|T|CDR|Yep.
167:33:30|T|LMP|Okay.
167:33:38|T|LMP|come around this way.
167:33:40|T|LMP|Okay. John's getting about two rakes; he's done two rakes. And he's got about 15 pebbles.
167:33:52|T|CDR|There's not any there.
167:33:54|T|LMP|That's a pretty good, little sample.
167:33:57|T|LMP|There you go. Look at that! That's a bagful now. Third one was really fruitful.  Okay. Turn it - There you go.
167:33:14|T|CDR|Hey, one of them had - I could see vesicles in one of them.
167:34:17|T|LMP|Yeah, I could too. Okay. That's in 421, Tony.
167:34:41|T|LMP|Okay. And getting a soil.
167:35:01|T|CDR|Sure, sure it would have worked, Charlie. That's a good idea, too.
167:35:09|T|LMP|Okay, 422 for the soil sample, Tony.
167:35:11|C|Eng|Okay.
167:35:13|T|LMP|That's enough, John. That's a hundred grams.
167:35:17|T|CDR|Okay. Little bit too -
167:35:21|T|LMP|That's okay.
167:35:23|T|CDR|100 kilograms - - kilometers.
167:35:29|T|LMP|Okay, get an &quot;after&quot; of that, please, while I pick this bag up.
167:35:30|T|CDR|Some large number.
167:35:37|T|LMP|How's our time going, Tony?
167:35:38|C|Eng|Oh, you're doing really fine. We've got an extension here, and you've got about 25 minutes .
167:35:46|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Let's go back to the Rover. Put your bag on there and head out for the big rock. Because you got a bag on your back, and we'll use it.
167:35:59|T|LMP|Okay.
167:36:03|C|Eng|We think that sounds like a great plan.
167:36:07|T|LMP|Didn't need -
167:36:10|T|CDR|Look at the size of that biggie !
167:36:11|T|CDR|It is a biggie, isn't it. It may be further away than we think because -
167:36:17|T|LMP|No, it's not very far. It was just right beyond you .
167:36:19|T|CDR|Theoretically, huh?
167:36:20|T|LMP|Yeah.
167:36:21|T|CDR|Like everything else around here, a couple of weeks later -
167:36:23|T|LMP|Okay. Let's see. I got the shovel . The rake's best choice . And I got some bags and -
167:36:30|T|CDR|You got enough bags? I'll leave mine here.
167:36:33|T|LMP|Well, I've only got - I got about 10 or so.
167:36:37|T|CDR|Okay. That's how many I got.
167:36:39|T|LMP|Okay. Bring yours, too.
167:36:43|T|CDR|A rake and a shovel, right?
167:36:44|T|LMP|No, not the shovel.
167:36:45|T|CDR|Want the rake?
167:36:46|T|LMP|Yeah, the rake is the best way.
167:36:48|T|CDR|That's what I got.
167:36:49|T|LMP|Okay.  We'll stop about halfway down here and do another rake. How's that?
167:36:57|T|CDR|Sounds like a good idea, Charlie.
167:37:26|T|CDR|Well, I think we'd get permanently shadowed under that big rock. Look at that fillet on this side, Charlie.
167:37:31|T|LMP|Okay. Well, we need the shovel for that.
167:37:33|T|CDR|Get it with this here !
167:37:35|T|LMP|Okay. Yeah, we can reach in there if -  I see what you mean. Uh-huh. Okay.
167:37:55|T|LMP|Don't know why I'm taking that down-Sun;  don't have the chart in there.
167:38:23|T|LMP|Okay. He's getting a couple of whitish frags, and then dust-covered, gray-looking frags. Think you got a bag full there, John.
167:38:34|T|CDR|Yep, three scoops and a bag full.
167:38:36|T|LMP|It's all salted with that one white rock there.  Super. Now, okay.
167:38:51|C|Eng|We agree; it's super.
167:38:53|T|LMP|Okay., that's in 423, Tony.
167:38:55|C|Eng|Okay, 423.
167:38:57|T|LMP|Okay.
167:38:59|T|CDR|Hang onto this, for a second. That's going in Charlie's SCB.
167:39:08|C|Eng|Okay.
167:39:09|T|LMP|Try an &quot;after&quot; of that, John, and I'll get the soil sample.
167:39:15|T|LMP|Okay.
167:39:20|T|LMP|Man, it's hard under there, you know it?
167:39:22|T|CDR|Yeah. That's why the rake wouldn't go down.
167:39:25|T|LMP|-
167:39:27|T|CDR|I'm not going anywhere. Hit it again.
167:39:32|T|LMP|Tony, there must be a big rock right under here.
167:39:35|T|CDR|Yeah. It's -
167:39:37|T|LMP|I can't get the rake in, but that's just -
167:39:40|T|CDR|Oh, look at that, Charlie.
167:39:41|T|LMP|I know, it's all white under here, isn't it?
167:39:42|T|CDR|Yeah.
167:39:47|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Down about a centimeter or less, it's all white.
167:39:54|C|Eng|Okay. You feel like that's -
167:39:55|T|LMP|
167:39:56|C|Eng|- a rock surface?
167:39:59|T|LMP|Yeah, I think it might be a rock surface and it's one of those friable ones, the fractured ones, and we're just chipping off - Here, John, I can get a soil sample from where you kicked it up with your foot.
167:40:21|T|CDR|Okay. Get a -
167:40:23|T|LMP|Okay. You want another one?
167:40:34|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. That soil sample is going in bag -
167:40:41|T|LMP|388, Tony.
167:40:42|C|Eng|Okay, 388.
167:40:44|C|Eng|And we better -
167:40:45|T|LMP|Okay -
167:40:45|C|Eng|- press on for the big boulder.
167:40:47|T|LMP|
167:40:50|T|LMP|Okay. We're headed that way. You get the tongs, John?
167:40:54|T|CDR|Yep. I got them.
167:40:55|T|LMP|I'll carry the rake.  Okay, Tony; my guess is that most of these rocks around here are extremely shocked.
167:41:09|T|CDR|-
167:41:14|T|LMP|All these in this area look the same. Hope that thing is not coming off.
167:41:21|T|CDR|Yeah. In the sunlight, Houston, this white rock has sort of a greenish hue to it, this white rock breccia. Which is what all this is we're walking on right now, is this white rock breccia that Charlie chipped out of -  And I guess this is probably the second layer up. I would reckon that, if we could see to the bottom , we could say for sure if this big black rock is right out of the bottom. But my guess, from the old photographs, it probably is.
167:41:59|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds like a good guess.
167:42:00|T|CDR|Look. See this rock right here, Charlie?!
167:42:03|T|LMP|Look at the size of that rock!
167:42:07|C|Eng|We can see.
167:42:10|T|LMP|The closer I get to it, the bigger it is.
167:42:13|T|CDR|Yeah, but look at the permanent shadowed part, Charlie.
167:42:14|T|LMP|On this side over here?
167:42:15|T|CDR|Yeah. No, right here on this one. See that shadow? That must be permanent.
167:42:20|T|LMP|No, I bet you it's not.  The Sun's going down over there, John.
167:42:25|T|CDR|Yeah, you're right.
167:42:26|T|LMP|See.  If you come back here in two weeks, and - it'll be dark!  Well, maybe a week, and you'd have Sun over there.
167:42:39|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, this is a very blocky area here.
167:42:43|T|CDR|And look at the shape of that rascal.
167:42:50|T|LMP|Yeah.  We don't see any glass, though, particularly.
167:42:57|T|CDR|No, I guess I'd have to call this a black matrix . Looks like the matrix has reversed itself now, it's all black matrix.
167:43:11|T|LMP|Well, Tony, that's your &quot;house rock&quot; right there.
167:43:14|C|Eng|Very good.
167:43:15|T|CDR|Charlie, don't get too near the edge of that thing, it falls off. Look over at your right; it falls off pretty good.
167:43:30|T|CDR|Okay, now we had to come down a pretty good slope to get to this rock, so we may have to leave early to get back.
167:43:35|T|LMP|Yes, sir. I agree.
167:43:36|C|Eng|You've got about 17 minutes before you'll have to drive off, so we'll have to hustle with this.
167:43:52|T|LMP|Okay, John. Here's a -  Looky here. Can we whack with the -  See, look at that. See, it's glass coated, and this is just fractured off. We could pull that off. Big chunks of that'll come right off.
167:44:14|T|CDR|Right.
167:44:15|T|LMP|And it's got a bluish tint to it, doesn't it?
167:44:19|T|CDR|It does.
167:44:20|T|LMP|It doesn't look like the real basalt.
167:44:24|T|CDR|Look at that shatter cone right there, Charlie. I'll be darned.
167:44:28|T|LMP|It is. Yeah.
167:44:29|T|CDR|I'm sure.
167:44:30|T|LMP|Right there.
167:44:31|C|Eng|Outstanding.
167:44:32|T|CDR|Maybe there's two of them.
167:44:36|C|Eng|Yeah, make a good picture of that one for Muehlberger.
167:44:39|T|CDR|Well, that settles that, huh?.
167:44:41|T|LMP|Okay, move it down a little bit.
167:44:42|T|CDR|That settles that, doesn't it, Houston?
167:44:45|T|LMP|Okay, got it.   Okay, here's a chunk of it. The black rock looks - Some of it's glass-coated, Tony, and man, that is a shatter cone.
167:45:00|T|CDR|Charlie, let's get a piece of it.
167:45:01|T|LMP|Okay, here you go. I got a piece.
167:45:02|T|CDR|Okay.
167:45:18|T|CDR|Okay.
167:45:20|T|LMP|Okay. That's going in bag 389.
167:45:22|T|CDR|Wait a minute. Let me - Hold it up.
167:45:23|T|LMP|Okay, let's just -
167:45:26|T|CDR|Okay, I'll take a picture.
167:45:29|C|Eng|Okay. We copy. 389.
167:45:31|T|LMP|It's pretty badly shattered, Tony, so I don't know whether it's going to stay together or not.
167:45:38|T|CDR|Hit it, Charlie. I got the pictures.  I really - . That's right near the shatter cone. Ha, ha.
167:45:47|T|LMP|Yeah.
167:45:49|T|CDR|I might suspect as much. Now, don't worry about that.
167:45:57|T|LMP|Okay; that's four little samples -
167:45:58|T|CDR|Scoot back; and why don't I get an &quot;after&quot;?
167:46:00|T|LMP|Okay.
167:46:11|T|LMP|Okay, five samples in 389, Tony -
167:46:14|C|Eng|Okay, 389.
167:46:15|T|LMP|- of that black. There's a vein - Look at that veinlet running through -
167:46:21|T|CDR|Yeah.
167:46:22|T|LMP|- Right there, John, of a breccia. Man, that's a big rock. Wow. Whew.
167:46:30|T|LMP|Okay, John. Here's this white stuff. Here's a rock, John, that is not a breccia -
167:46:37|T|CDR|Yeah.
167:46:38|T|LMP|- and it's, and it's -
167:46:39|T|CDR|A clast in the black rock.
167:46:40|T|LMP|- it's a clast in a black rock. Look here. How about that?
167:46:46|T|CDR|Let put that in your bag.
167:46:47|T|LMP|Okay.
167:46:48|T|CDR|Put it back where you got it for a second and let me -
167:46:52|T|LMP|Okay.
167:46:53|T|CDR|- get a picture of it before - Well, they can fit it in - No, just a little way; they can fit it in.  Okay. Is that how it was, more or less?
167:47:02|T|LMP|Yeah, more or less.
167:47:03|T|CDR|Okay, now I'll get it.
167:47:06|T|LMP|Get an &quot;after&quot;.
167:47:10|T|CDR|See. That has a clast of that rock in it, too.
167:47:11|T|LMP|Okay, that's a - I wish we could partially stick that in a bag.
167:47:15|T|CDR|Why don't we stick it in your bag?
167:47:16|T|LMP|Oh, okay. I mean one of these , 'cause it might break up. Okay, that's 424.
167:47:23|T|CDR|No, it ain't gonna break up.
167:47:24|T|LMP|It ain't gonna - Okay.
167:47:41|T|CDR|3 meter?
167:47:42|T|LMP|No, this clast is about 3 meters.
167:47:45|T|CDR|Centimeters, Charlie.
167:47:47|T|LMP|Huh? Well, it goes from here all the way up to there.
167:47:51|T|CDR|Oh! The one you're talking about.
167:47:52|T|LMP|Yeah.
167:47:53|T|CDR|Did you get a stereo of that? Did you get a flight line of that?
167:47:55|T|LMP|Yeah. Uh-huh.
167:47:56|T|CDR|Okay.
167:48:12|T|CDR|Wait a second. Go.
167:48:16|T|LMP|Okay. Got it?
167:48:19|T|CDR|Yeah.
167:48:26|T|CDR|Hard, isn't it?
167:48:28|T|LMP|Yeah, it's hard. But it's gonna come - I'm gonna get a piece of it.
167:48:33|T|CDR|I got it, Charlie.
167:48:34|T|LMP|Okay. Here's a good piece right up here.
167:48:44|T|CDR|bag open.
167:48:46|T|LMP|Okay, I got it. Okay, Tony. Of the white clast - it's not nearly as shocked - is going in 425.
167:48:56|T|CDR|Wait a minute. Here's -
167:48:57|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 425.
167:49:01|T|LMP|Okay. Here's another piece right there, John.
167:49:02|T|CDR|Okay.
167:49:04|T|LMP|And here's another big piece right over here.
167:49:07|C|Eng|Did y'all see a permanently shadowed sample around there?
167:49:13|T|CDR|Nope, we don't.
167:49:15|T|LMP|No. Sure don't.
167:49:16|C|Eng|Okay. Our best guess is that it should be on the south side -
167:49:18|T|LMP|There's a big hole -
167:49:19|C|Eng|- if there's any.
167:49:24|T|CDR|Well, we were over on the south side, and we didn't see any.
167:49:27|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
167:49:29|T|CDR|The hole, unfortunately, is sort of -  That's sort of an east-west split there, Charlie.
167:49:36|T|LMP|I know it. It is an east-west split. Tony, we got an east-west split here, that we can get the rake in.
167:49:46|C|Eng|Why don't you go ahead and take some soil out of that.
167:49:48|T|LMP|Here, John.  Okay.
167:49:55|C|Eng|Oh, you're gonna to have to leave after this sample.
167:50:01|T|LMP|Okay. I was gonna say, it's probably a long hike back up that hill.
167:50:09|T|CDR|In there or not, Charlie?
167:50:11|T|LMP|Huh? Yeah, I can get in here. Right up next to this rock right here will be a good place. I got it! Ha Ha.
167:50:26|T|CDR|get the bag square . Okay.
167:50:33|T|LMP|Wait a minute, I'll give you a little bit more.
167:50:46|T|CDR|It's not a classic east-west split, Houston, but it's one.
167:50:50|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
167:50:51|T|CDR|Going in bag 390.
167:50:52|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 390. And we need a reference soil.
167:50:56|T|CDR|Hold these tongs for a second?
167:51:01|T|LMP|Okay.
167:51:05|T|CDR|Don't go down there 5 meters. I don't want you -
167:51:07|T|LMP|I'm not.  Here you go.
167:51:15|T|CDR|Okay.
167:51:16|T|LMP|Here you go.
167:51:19|T|CDR|Okay.
167:51:23|T|LMP|I guess you ought to stick the tongs in, and we ought to document this.
167:51:27|T|CDR|Okay.
167:51:34|T|CDR|If we're gonna do a reference sample, let's get that piece of glass right there.
167:51:36|T|LMP|Okay.
167:51:39|T|CDR|The tongs are not gonna go in this ground, Charlie.
167:51:41|T|LMP|I know it. It's a big rock down there. Why don't you just hold it there, and I'll take the picture. Okay?
167:51:47|T|CDR|Okay.
167:51:48|T|LMP|Click. Click. Okay.
167:52:00|T|LMP|if you can kick up some, John.
167:52:08|T|CDR|Got it? You got it.
167:52:10|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The soil here is very hard, and the rake really won't go into it. Bending the tines like we used to do in training.
167:52:20|C|Eng|Right. Understand. If you can see anything around there that's kind of loose and not in an east-west split, kind of scoop some of that up. If you can't, we'll just have to leave it.
167:52:34|T|CDR|There's nothing loose.  Charlie's got something.
167:52:35|T|LMP|Okay, there's about 25 grams.
167:52:41|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine. That's all I need.
167:52:46|T|LMP|Okay. Got it?
167:52:48|T|CDR|That's all Tony needs.  you PI on this one, Tony?
167:52:54|C|Eng|No. I said, 'that's all they need'.
167:52:58|T|CDR|Oh, okay.
167:53:07|T|LMP|There's a real frothy rock right there, John. You want to throw that in?   Doesn't look like you're - There you go.
167:53:23|T|CDR|Oh, man, I - -  Here, can you hold this, Charlie?
167:53:28|T|LMP|What? The tongs?
167:53:31|T|CDR|Yeah. For a second.
167:53:32|T|LMP|Yeah.
167:53:33|T|CDR|Got to do that bag better.
167:53:38|T|LMP|Man, that rock had just cracked off just in the right -  Okay, Tony. This large block is a very - The house-sized one, it's about 20 -  30 - 20 meters long, by maybe 10 meters high, and it's a large breccia. Got a grab sample going in 393, white matrix with glass on it, and it's a -
167:54:05|T|CDR|Don't back up any more, Charlie.
167:54:06|T|LMP|I'm sorry. Lost my balance. It 's got some fractures in it that run north -
167:54:11|T|CDR|Let's go on back.
167:54:12|T|LMP|Okay.
167:54:12|T|CDR|
167:54:13|C|Eng|Okay, and we'll have to start on back.
167:54:17|T|LMP|Okay, here you go. Here you go, John.
167:54:19|T|CDR|Huh?
167:54:25|T|CDR|Okay. Let's go on back.
167:54:26|T|LMP|I am. Be right with you.
167:54:35|C|Eng|Did you see anything that you were pretty confident was igneous? I'm thinking about the padded bags.  .
167:54:45|T|LMP|Yeah, this rock we - Oh.
167:54:51|T|CDR|An igneous rock.
167:54:53|T|LMP|Yeah, if we'd of brought the padded bags - This right here is an igneous rock.
167:54:56|T|CDR|The whole place looks igneous, Houston.
167:54:59|C|Eng|Were there any near the Rover?
167:55:01|T|LMP|These large clasts in it are igneous -
167:55:02|C|Eng|Right. For the padded bags, -
167:55:03|T|CDR|You mean &quot;black&quot; -
167:55:03|C|Eng|- we would want it lying on the surface.
167:55:08|T|CDR|- Is that what you're talking about, volcan -
167:55:13|T|LMP|I'll take the bags.  can't get them out -
167:55:17|T|CDR|
167:55:18|T|LMP|- of the tongs.
167:55:19|T|CDR|Well, you're gonna have to hold that so I can get the tongs unloose.
167:55:22|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
167:55:23|T|CDR|Hold the bag.
167:55:24|T|LMP|I'm trying to!
167:55:30|T|CDR|I can't believe it.
167:55:31|T|LMP|Got it. I can't either. Let's go.
167:55:39|T|LMP|y'all see us all the way down here, Tony?
167:55:41|C|Eng|We're just seeing you now. When you were around the corner there, we didn't see you very much.
167:55:45|T|CDR|Okay, take it easy. Take it easy, Charlie.
167:55:50|T|LMP|Sorry.  Sorry we had to get down in here, but that was a unique sample we thought, and -
167:55:57|T|CDR|Okay. This big black rock, this big black and white rock right here that we're just traversing by, is also the same kind of rock. Man, look at the size of it.
167:56:08|T|LMP|They're all the same. There are two rock types here, Tony: that white matrix one, and then the black - the one with the black that -
167:56:13|T|CDR|And in places where the black and the white are about 50-50 down here too.
167:56:21|T|LMP|Mm-hmm.
167:56:23|T|CDR|But there are very few of those.
167:56:26|T|LMP|And it has the same character of the rocks - up close - that I would think that South Ray rocks had, when you look on the rim of that crater.
167:56:35|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
167:56:47|T|CDR|Can we put those two rock bags under your seat, Tony, or you got too much stuff in there now?
167:56:52|T|LMP|What did you say, Ralph?
167:56:57|T|CDR|I said  put those two rock bags under your seat.
167:57:02|T|LMP|Sure.
167:57:11|C|Eng|If you see a fist-sized, igneous rock near the Rover, we'll use the padded bags here. If not, we'll just forget them. For now.
167:57:16|T|LMP|Okay.
167:57:22|T|CDR|Well, but - How's - It's gonna - Charlie, there's your polarimetry thing .
167:57:26|T|LMP|I took it off and threw it away.
167:57:32|T|CDR|It's gonna be - I bet you all this stuff up here is really shocked, Houston. Does that make any difference to you? And, therefore, is not gonna be too hard.
167:57:44|C|Eng|Rog. We understand.  All right, if you find a good dense one that you think has got a good hard surface on it, we'll go ahead and take it.
167:57:59|T|CDR|Take it, huh? Hmm. Alright
167:58:03|T|LMP|Well, they're pretty dust covered. I'll tell you what, we'll pick one up and give it a try anyway.
167:58:07|C|Eng|Okay. That's the best we can do.
167:58:10|T|LMP|You would.  Well! We're back. The old ticker is really thumping, I bet you.
167:58:22|C|Eng|No, you're doing fine. You got up to about 120 is all.
167:58:29|T|LMP|Is that all?!
167:58:31|C|Eng|Okay; 128, in fact.
167:58:38|T|LMP|The orange juice comes in great.
167:58:42|C|Eng|Right. Deke says -
167:58:43|T|CDR|getting the suit.
167:58:43|C|Eng|- if you'd been exercising the last few days, you'd be in better shape.
167:58:50|T|LMP|Man, we wore the rope out on the Exer-Genie.
167:58:54|T|CDR|No. We didn't wear the rope out!
167:58:58|T|LMP|I's just teasing, boss.
167:59:09|T|LMP|John, I hope you got the shovel.
167:59:11|T|CDR|Charlie, I ain't got the shovel.  didn't take it down there.
167:59:12|T|LMP|No.
167:59:14|C|Eng|You didn't take it down.
167:59:16|T|CDR|Where did we leave it?
167:59:20|C|Eng|Should be on the Rover.
167:59:21|T|LMP|Here it is in your seat. Whew. Yeah. It's on the Rover.
167:59:30|T|CDR|It'll be too big for a padded bag.
167:59:31|T|LMP|No, it'll go in.
167:59:37|T|CDR|I think it's too big, Charlie.
167:59:39|T|LMP|Well, let's give it a go.  Okay, Tony. While we were gone, we got a caution flag.
167:59:48|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
167:59:50|T|LMP|Something popped up -
167:59:51|T|CDR|battery temp.
167:59:52|C|Eng|That's the Batt 2 temp.
167:59:53|T|LMP|I think it's the battery temp. Number 2 is 135 .
167:59:58|C|Eng|That's okay. When we drive off here, we'll put them all on Battery 1.
168:00:05|T|LMP|Okay.
168:00:19|T|LMP|Okay. Now, I'm going to put these stuff under - There you go.
168:00:25|T|CDR|Think that'll go in there?
168:00:26|T|LMP|Yeah, just push it in; it'll go in. A little big, but it'll do it. Why don't you put it in number 6 there, John. Now -  Let's see if I can find another one here.
168:00:51|T|CDR|Okay; but get a smaller one, Charlie.
168:00:52|T|LMP|I am.
168:01:15|C|Eng|If one of you are free there, we'd like to switch out -
168:01:17|T|LMP|That one won't work .
168:01:18|C|Eng|- the mag in the DAC.
168:01:28|T|LMP|Okay. In about 2 seconds, we'll be free, Tony.
168:01:30|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
168:01:31|T|LMP|Boy, I'll tell you, this regolith is about a inch deep here in most places. It's - .There's just lots of rocks under this stuff, Tony. This tells me it's -
168:01:47|C|Eng|That's really interesting. You know, I didn't expect that.
168:01:50|T|LMP|-  than South Ray is.
168:01:56|T|LMP|Anywhere - You can barely get the shovel in anywhere. Okay. We got two rocks for your padded bags; but I'm not sure they are going to do you any good ; they are so dust covered .
168:02:07|C|Eng|Okay -
168:02:24|C|Eng|No, that's all right -
168:02:26|C|Eng|- we'll take your word for it.
168:02:35|T|LMP|Okay. What mag - Just give me a magazine - Let's see, S on there.  T or U, John, either one.
168:02:49|T|CDR|T or U. Okay. Here's T, Charlie.
168:02:54|T|LMP|Okay. How about Z-ing this up for me?
168:02:55|T|CDR|Okay. I'll do it.
168:02:56|T|LMP|I'll put the mag on.
168:03:09|T|LMP|Rats.  Guess what?
168:03:36|T|LMP|Okay. I thought that thing hadn't run, Tony, but the little ball had just stuck.  Whew!
168:03:42|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
168:03:43|T|LMP|Oh, John!
168:03:46|T|CDR|What was it?
168:03:48|T|LMP|The mag - I did it. I'm sorry.
168:03:50|T|CDR|got it.
168:03:51|T|LMP|Got it? Okay.
168:03:55|T|CDR|It's already empty , right?
168:03:56|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:03:57|C|Eng|It's funny how a little hammering fixes most of the hardware.
168:03:58|T|CDR|
168:03:59|T|LMP|Okay.
168:04:12|C|Eng|And we want the DAC at f/4 and 12 frames per second.
168:04:16|T|LMP|Sounds like it -  Okay, it's set; and it's on f/4 now.
168:04:29|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
168:04:31|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. Here's bag 6.
168:04:35|T|LMP|Okay, John.
168:04:36|T|CDR|Both padded bags are in there.
168:04:38|T|LMP|Okay.
168:04:39|T|CDR|Now, Houston, the Velcro came off both those bags; and we weren't able to put them tight like they are supposed to be.
168:04:46|C|Eng|Okay. We understand.  And they go under your seat, John.
168:05:01|T|CDR|We put them in an SCB. You don't want them in an SCB?
168:05:05|T|LMP|No. They don't. They want -
168:05:06|T|CDR|I think with the Velcro off of them, you can't hardly zee them. I think we ought to leave them in the SCB. If they get in there with the film, we will be in trouble.
168:05:15|C|Eng|Okay, fine. Let's just leave them in the SCB.
168:05:18|T|CDR|-  Okay.
168:05:31|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I'm gonna close the HTC.
168:05:33|T|LMP|Okay.  They're right on the top there, Tony, in number 6; and there's no rocks on top of them. I think they'll be fine.
168:05:49|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
168:05:56|T|CDR|Charlie, we're just going to lose it. Why don't we just leave it under the seat?
168:05:59|T|LMP|I can't get it under my seat.
168:06:02|T|CDR|Yeah, but it's full of nice things.
168:06:04|T|LMP|Okay. Well, I'll hold it in my hand then. I don't -
168:06:09|T|CDR|Want to see if you can put it on?
168:06:11|T|LMP|Well, if you move away a little bit, yeah. A little bit more. Okay. That's fine.
168:06:28|T|LMP|It's on there. You know, those things ought to have locks on them like that - The little green locks like the ones on the -  Hold still.  John, you got - Am I doing something to make you move?  Okay, now that's cinched down. Tight.
168:07:11|T|CDR|Got it, huh?
168:07:13|T|LMP|And the Velcro is - tight.  But I don't guarantee anything.
168:07:19|T|CDR|All righty.
168:07:20|T|LMP|Okay. What's my mag count? My mirror's so dirty, I can't even see.
168:07:24|T|CDR|It's 122, Charlie.
168:07:28|T|LMP|Okay. Let's go.
168:07:30|C|Eng|And, John, what's yours?
168:07:35|T|CDR|Mine's 102.
168:07:37|C|Eng|Okay.
168:07:46|T|CDR|Charlie.
168:07:53|T|LMP|Good grab sample.
168:07:55|T|CDR|Yeah, I thought you'd like that one.
168:08:02|T|LMP|Okay. I'm gonna reset the caution flag.
168:08:04|T|CDR|Okay.
168:08:05|T|LMP|Okay.  &quot;Frame count, far polarimeter&quot;, we've done. Pan - I think we got enough pans; did Stone, Kiva, North Ray.
168:08:15|T|CDR|Okay, turning off the tube .
168:08:21|T|CDR|Okay. Houston. , going Mode Switch to 1.
168:08:22|C|Eng|Okay. Fine. And when you get ready to drive off there, we'd like -
168:08:31|T|CDR|W
168:08:32|T|LMP|I guess we're a little late -
168:08:33|C|Eng|like the rear Drive Power to Bus Baker and the steering to Bus Baker; Rear Steering.
168:08:46|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. You're in?
168:08:50|T|LMP|Well, I can't -
168:08:51|T|CDR|No. You're not in, you're - There you go.
168:08:53|T|LMP|No. I didn't think I was in. I can always tell.
168:08:58|T|CDR|Okay; Bus Baker with the Rear Drive Power And Rear Steering to Bus Baker.
168:09:07|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. One final comment here. Again, no impression of - to me, anyway - of layering or of bedrock, just loose rocks in the walls. And they're splayed out in ray patterns.
168:09:25|T|CDR|Man, that is some hole.
168:09:45|C|Eng|Okay, understand. And Station 13, -
168:09:47|T|LMP|Ready.
168:09:48|C|Eng|- now, will be right down your tracks about a half a kilometer, and we'd like to stop in the midst of those big boulders you described on the way up.
168:09:59|T|CDR|Okay. My kind of Station 13.
168:10:05|T|LMP|Okay. The DAC's running.
168:10:06|C|Eng|Good show. You beat me to it.
168:10:13|T|LMP|There are your tracks. Look at that, John. How far - See them back over there?
168:10:16|T|CDR|Looks to me like we just go around in a circle here, Charlie.
168:10:19|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:10:30|T|LMP|We can't see old Orion from here.  This is going to be something going down this hill.
168:10:38|T|CDR|Sure we - We didn't - I'm not sure we came up that hill.
168:10:45|T|LMP|Yeah, we did. There's the tracks.
168:10:52|T|CDR|We sure come off it, didn't we?
168:10:53|T|LMP|Look at that slope! Be sure that you got the brakes on. Tony, this is at least a 15-degree slope we're going down, and that Rover came right up it and you never even knew it.  Brake that beauty, John.  Man, are we accelerating. Super. I should have had the camera pointed forward.  Okay, Tony, that was at - I think it was 179 at 4.4, that little steep slope there. Whoever said this was the Cayley Plain?
168:11:43|T|CDR|Well, that was down the rim of the crater here.  We've just set a new world's speed record, Houston; 17 kilometers an hour on the Moon.
168:11:50|C|Eng|Well, let's not set any more.
168:12:00|T|CDR|I'm with you.
168:12:02|T|LMP|Okay, John. I got us out 2 hours and -
168:12:05|C|Eng|Forty minutes.
168:12:06|T|LMP|- 40 minutes, it looks like.
168:12:10|T|CDR|I guess that would be a new Moon speed record, wouldn't it?
168:12:12|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:12:13|T|CDR|I hadn't thought about.
168:12:14|C|Eng|And all your -
168:12:15|T|LMP|Tony, going back -
168:12:16|C|Eng|- data looks good
168:12:17|T|LMP|- cross-Sun -  Okay. Going back across Sun the tracks, we just barely penetrated the regolith; maybe an eighth of an inch or so.  Whatever it is, it's going to be real firm here. Hopefully, we can get - Isn't 13 a double-core one?
168:12:51|C|Eng|Negative. We'll have a double core -
168:12:52|T|LMP|Feel that old Sun coming down on your -
168:12:55|C|Eng|- back at the Station 10 prime. Station -
168:12:57|T|LMP|Oh, good. I think we might do it there. Here, I don't think -
168:13:03|C|Eng|Okay.  Station 13 has a rake soil, then documented samples until you run out of time.
168:13:16|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:13:17|T|CDR|Remember?
168:13:18|T|LMP|Yeah. That big one we thought was the rim and it was -
168:13:21|T|CDR|Yeah. What we're up on now is a sort of a pre-rim rim of this impact crater.  And it's 600 meters from the rim.
168:13:45|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm panning your camera around at various places here - the 16 - to get right and left.
168:13:51|C|Eng|Okay. It's probably out of film now.
168:13:52|T|LMP|Again, the impression is that -  Already?
168:13:58|C|Eng|No, we're just -
168:13:59|T|CDR|Turn it around this way, Charlie, and I'll tell you.
168:13:59|C|Eng|- going to turn it off now. I'm sorry, Charlie.
168:14:06|T|CDR|It's half full, Charlie.
168:14:08|T|LMP|Okay. Turning it off.
168:14:10|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
168:14:15|T|LMP|Man, that's hard on the old fingers.  like it's still running, too.  That's the Rover I hear - Feeling that thing vibrating.
168:14:34|T|LMP|Remarkable, isn't it?
168:14:36|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:14:39|T|LMP|Tony, we just topped a - There's that - No, it can't be that. There's a big rock over there; but this other one is down at the bottom of this hill here, John, we came by.  We just topped another rise, and we're looking to the southeast back towards the Kant Plateau. It's an undulating surface, and indented for about - It's difficult to judge distances.
168:15:15|T|LMP|That's them, yeah.  But it's undulating until it hits the scarp of - I think I'll call it the Kant Plateau. That's the scarp on the map that you can map around like a little re-entrant on the map back to the east, and we can see back up that way and all the way up onto the top of the plateau.
168:15:39|C|Eng|Okay, and we won't want a Nav update of Station 13, so you can park either north or south, whichever is easiest for you.
168:15:49|T|LMP|Okay.  We almost spun out on that one, babe. That was great.
168:15:53|T|CDR|Okay; let's go by that - See that big rock over there? Maybe that's a permanently shadowed one.  Try it?
168:16:04|T|LMP|I don't think so, but we can go look. You know, following our tracks back, we might find that CSVC.
168:16:11|T|CDR|That's right, that's what I'm thinking.  If you see something that looks strange around here, that's it.  Oh, man.
168:16:23|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. On down this ridge, we're going down about at least a 5-degree slope. We have one real filleted rock that we're just passing now at 3.8 at 183, and then we have another rock down here that's the same size, about 3 meters across that has hardly any fillet. And that's the one we're going to stop by.
168:16:46|C|Eng|Okay. Good show. And your -
168:16:49|T|LMP|Is that what you meant, John? For permanently shadowed?
168:16:51|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:16:56|C|Eng|And your Cuff Checklist doesn't show TV here, but we'd like you to go through a normal TV power-up.
168:17:08|T|LMP|Okay.  I don't think we'll be able to align it here at - I haven't had any trouble aligning that thing, though, in just about any position. If we park north, we'll be in good shape for them.
168:17:22|T|CDR|Okay. Let's do that.
168:17:23|T|LMP|Okay.  Be able to see that biggie. That rock right there looks like that great big one we sampled up on the rim, John.
168:17:31|T|CDR|Sure does.
168:17:33|T|LMP|Okay. That's good. I just don't think it's going to be permanently shadowed, though.
168:17:37|T|CDR|I don't either.
168:17:45|C|Eng|Okay. I understand.
168:17:58|T|LMP|This thing is covered with dirt.
168:18:01|C|Eng|Roger. And our LCRU is heating up, so we'd like a good job on those. Even though we know you do it every time.
168:18:08|T|LMP|Needs dusting. Needs dusting, bad. Okay, Tony. We're at 2 - 358, 184, 6.5, 3.8, 50, 120 110 - Yeah, 110. Off-scale low, off-scale low; Batts of 120, 135; Rear is off-scale low on the Left; Right is 200. Okay. Forward is off-scale low, Left; Right 200.
168:19:07|C|Eng|Okay. The plan here is a rake soil first, together; and after you've done that, we'd like John to take an <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">LPM</a> and, Charlie, you can go sample.
168:19:20|T|LMP|Okay. Let me get a pan first. Okay?
168:19:24|C|Eng|Sounds good.
168:19:25|T|CDR|Charlie, how does this look for the antenna pointing?
168:19:32|T|LMP|Looks about right on to me.
168:19:34|T|CDR|Okay.
168:19:35|T|LMP|But that's hard - What's the signal strength?
168:19:45|T|CDR|I can -  Charlie, good.  - signal strength.
168:21:05|T|LMP|Okay. We got it.
168:21:06|T|CDR|Yeah. I got it. I got it. -
168:21:07|T|LMP|I can see you - Sight's in the center. Okay.  Look at that - Oh, I know. That pattern on the ground the mirror reflecting. Boy.  That faked me out. I thought we'd really found something, Tony!
168:21:34|C|Eng|How's that, Charlie?
168:21:40|T|LMP|How you reading, Tony?
168:21:42|C|Eng|Five by, Charlie.
168:21:43|T|LMP|Okay. We had a little trouble pointing the antenna.  Okay.
168:22:21|T|LMP|The rock types here appear to be the same as we sampled up on top , but we'll get you a rake-soil out in front of this big boulder over here.  Let's see; we need to get the bags and stuff.
168:22:55|T|LMP|Okay, John, both of us got bags on our backs, so why don't we just take these little bags.
168:23:00|T|CDR|Yep. Okay.
168:23:02|T|LMP|Okay.
168:23:08|T|CDR|I'm getting tongs for a gnomon.
168:23:09|T|LMP|Okay. That's a good idea.
168:23:36|T|CDR|Well, you could;  if there wasn't so much igneous soil on it. When I have it, we'll put it out there.
168:23:46|C|Eng|Okay.
168:23:47|T|CDR|I can't believe it.
168:23:49|T|LMP|I can't believe it.
168:23:56|T|LMP|Okay, John. See those - about four or five - little rocks right there?
168:24:00|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:24:01|T|LMP|Stick her down right there and let me - I'm sort of turned around here on my direction. I think I'm facing - South is over this way. The Sun's up over Stone. I can't believe it.
168:24:11|T|CDR|The Sun is so high.
168:24:19|T|CDR|Old gnomon - .
168:24:31|T|LMP|Up the slope, adroitly; like a gazelle! Got to Station 13, Tony, and it sure looks good.
168:24:50|C|Eng|Good show. It looks good here, too.
168:24:55|T|LMP|Okay; the regolith -
168:25:00|T|CDR|get a bag from you, Charlie.
168:25:01|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay. There's some glass in there, a black chip. In one rake, we got about 10 little - And the regolith here, Tony, seems to be a little bit more loosely compacted than up on the top .
168:25:35|T|CDR|I can't get my gnomon in.
168:25:37|T|LMP|That's okay.   Not very productive, though, on the small chips.
168:25:51|C|Eng|We'll -
168:25:52|T|LMP|
168:25:52|C|Eng|- just take what you've got.
168:25:54|T|LMP|- if I'd rake upslope, though, I bet you I'd get more.
168:25:56|T|CDR|Okay.
168:26:19|T|CDR|Okay -
168:26:20|T|LMP|Now here's a few more.
168:26:21|T|CDR|- that's a good one.
168:26:29|T|LM Crew|Okay.
168:26:30|T|CDR|There's about 20 small rocks going into bag 343.
168:26:33|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 343.
168:26:34|T|LMP|That's three scoopfuls , Tony.
168:26:37|C|Eng|Good show.
168:26:46|T|LMP|Okay, and a soil.
168:26:51|T|CDR|get another bag from you, Charlie.
168:26:53|T|LMP|Okay.
168:27:01|T|LMP|Ah, huh-huh. Ah, the old suit, wins every time.  I can't bend this beauty like we could on the training grounds.
168:27:18|T|CDR|-  Okay, that looks like 2 scoopsfuls going into bag 346.
168:27:26|T|LMP|Sack it!
168:27:27|C|Eng|Okay, 346.
168:27:35|T|LMP|Yeah. Tony, it -
168:27:41|C|Eng|And Charlie, you might look around -
168:27:44|T|LMP|Houston, the big eye is looking right at that big rock. What do you think of that beauty?
168:27:45|C|Eng|That's exactly what we're looking at -
168:27:48|T|CDR|
168:27:53|T|LMP|I am gonna hammer. I'll hammer chips from corners.
168:27:57|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
168:27:58|T|LMP|That's what I had in mind.
168:28:00|C|Eng|And if you get a chance - and it looks like some soil right on the south side, kind of underneath, might be permanently shadowed - you might take some of those and just put it in a bag.
168:28:11|T|LMP|All righty.
168:28:27|T|CDR|Well, Houston, I didn't park too good to do the LPM. If I go 45 feet from here, I'm going to be in the middle of a crater.
168:28:37|C|Eng|No. Pick a fairly level place -
168:28:38|T|CDR|- slope.
168:28:39|C|Eng|- just go a different direction.
168:28:44|T|CDR|Okay. You don't mind if I go out behind the Rover, for example?
168:28:47|C|Eng|No, that's fine.
168:28:50|T|CDR|Instead of at right angles to it.
168:28:53|T|LMP|John, where's those bags that's still got the bracket on it. Is it under your seat here?
168:28:58|T|CDR|What?
168:29:00|T|LMP|The bags that had the brackets on them?
168:29:01|T|CDR|I think they were about out.
168:29:05|T|LMP|No. Yeah. Here you go.
168:29:06|C|Eng|Okay, if you go out south, be a little careful on that cable; it'll be pulling at 90 degrees then.
168:29:16|T|CDR|Okay, well I think I'll go out as far - I'll go out south -  How about east-southeast?
168:29:30|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
168:29:31|T|CDR|It's off to the starboard bow or something.
168:29:35|T|LMP|Tony, we're about out of bags! Did we sample that much?
168:29:38|C|Eng|Oh, you've been really packing them away.
168:29:40|T|LMP|losing bags?
168:29:41|T|CDR|Yeah, we've only lost one set of bags, Charlie.
168:29:48|T|LMP|Okay. Here we go. Well, we've got a few left here.
168:30:12|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to get on the sunset - sunlit side, Tony, so I'll know what I'm whacking on here. You know, Tony. That might be a permanently-shadowed soil right in there. I think it is, as a matter of fact. It'll pass .
168:30:33|C|Eng|Good show, let's get one of those.
168:30:52|C|Eng|Let's try that.
168:30:53|T|LMP|Yes sir, baby. That is a perfect shadowed soil sample.
168:31:01|C|Eng|Outstanding!
168:31:05|T|LMP|It is really perfect! John, you couldn't have picked a better rock.
168:31:07|T|CDR|You're kidding.
168:31:08|T|LMP|No, it's really perfect. Just great!  I have to get my visor up to see something.  Man, I can't believe I'm going under this beauty.
168:31:53|T|LMP|Well, I don't know how long that rock's been there, but that dirt has been shadowed ever since it's been there.
168:31:59|C|Eng|Okay. That's what we want, Charlie.
168:32:08|C|Eng|Good show.
168:32:13|T|LMP|And I'm sorry, but it's gonna have to go in an old plastic bag, here, .
168:32:18|C|Eng|That's okay.
168:32:20|T|LMP|And it's number 426.
168:32:21|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 426. Any chance of getting soil underneath that now for the control?
168:32:30|T|LMP|Ah - Underneath - The shadowed, you mean?
168:32:33|C|Eng|Right. Underneath where you just took ; just dig deeper.
168:32:40|T|LMP|That way -  Yeah. Let me - put my visor down. That thing is bright. Get out of the Sun.
168:32:54|T|LMP|Yeah, I can get that for you.
168:33:04|T|LMP|That's about 100 grams, Tony; maybe 200.
168:33:07|C|Eng|That's all we need.
168:33:12|T|LMP|Okay.
168:33:20|T|LMP|I don't know how to turn it on.
168:33:26|T|LMP|- that free.
168:33:26|T|CDR|Okay, how long does it take it to warm up, Tony?
168:33:30|C|Eng|We're getting that , John.
168:33:39|C|Eng|Okay. We'll take a mark now, and go a minute and a half, and I'll tell you when .
168:33:56|T|CDR|They give 'em to you at the supermarket, Charlie.
168:34:04|T|LMP|See how that sample bag is -
168:34:08|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:34:09|T|LMP|- is sitting up there - I mean that SCB - is sitting up there, Tony.
168:34:11|C|Eng|Yep, sure do.
168:34:16|T|LMP|What you need, looks like to me, is a bag that has two handles on it -
168:34:21|T|CDR|Can I help you, Charlie? Let me put that in the bag.
168:34:24|T|LMP|I got it.
168:34:25|T|CDR|Okay.
168:34:27|T|LMP|That ain't very much, but we'll keep -  Oh, you just kicked - Well, I got enough. Go ahead .
168:34:35|C|Eng|Okay. That'll be good on the soil sample. And we'd like to spend the rest of the time - and there isn't much of it - hammering on that rock.
168:34:46|T|LMP|Okay, there's about 50 grams in the control .
168:34:49|C|Eng|That's fine.
168:34:50|T|CDR|It's going into bag 427.
168:34:53|C|Eng|Okay, 427.
168:35:00|T|CDR|Boy. It just might be permanently shadowed, Houston; because it's downslope, and when the - Golly.
168:35:20|T|CDR|Oh, that there is one of those gopher holes.
168:35:23|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:35:27|C|Eng|Hey, John -
168:35:28|T|CDR|
168:35:28|C|Eng|you think you can push that one over?
168:35:32|T|LMP|You do that in West Texas, and you get a rattlesnake. Here, you get permanently-shadowed soil.
168:35:37|T|CDR|One thing about this rock is it has some - This is the one that I noticed when we were coming up the way that had some of these holes in it look like vesicles, Charlie.
168:35:45|T|LMP|Yep, they sure do, big ones. Biggies.
168:35:50|T|CDR|Couldn't be zap holes.
168:35:53|T|LMP|Hey, John - Nothing.
168:35:54|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. We'd like magazine Foxtrot on your camera.
168:36:00|T|LMP|Okay.
168:36:01|C|Eng|And, John, you can do the LPM any time .
168:36:06|T|LMP|What a time to run out of - Okay -
168:36:08|T|CDR|Okay. Let me take a picture for you, Charlie. Where at and how much?
168:36:12|T|LMP|Tony, this is the black matrix with some excellent crystals in it that also are milky in color. Don't see any cleavage though or striations.  about a centimeter across; and it has a matrix of that white rock, like up on the rim. Not a matrix, but some clasts of that .
168:36:44|T|LMP|There you go.
168:36:43|T|CDR|
168:36:51|T|LMP|Tony, say again the mag?
168:36:54|C|Eng|You'll need magazine Foxtrot, and we're about out of time here -
168:36:56|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, we're ready to take the L -
168:36:58|C|Eng|- we'd like to sample - Okay. Go ahead, John.
168:37:03|T|CDR|I'll take the LPM readings. Okay, 161, 711, 117.  160, 711, 120  160, 712, 117.
168:37:27|C|Eng|Okay. We copied that, John; and visor down.
168:37:53|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. Just get a couple of samples there, and you should be about ready to go then when John gets that reeled up.
168:38:10|T|CDR|-
168:38:16|T|LMP|Okay, I got a couple - a handful of chips there.
168:38:33|T|CDR|See here, Charlie? When you get under the dirt, it's all white.
168:38:38|T|LMP|I know. Okay; 428, Tony.
168:38:41|C|Eng|Okay.
168:39:26|T|LMP|Oh, rats.  Oops. John, I'm trapped.
168:39:41|T|CDR|What do you mean?
168:39:44|T|LMP|I'm against this rock.
168:39:49|T|CDR|You can't get up?
168:39:50|T|LMP|Well, I didn't want to fall down - Now I got it. Yeah. There we go. I'm sorry.  Give me a hand.  Okay; thanks.
168:40:33|T|LMP|One of them is too big to go in the bags, but the other ones, right now, are going in 429.
168:40:39|C|Eng|Okay, 429. And we'd like you to go back and start loading up.
168:40:45|T|LMP|Okay, I am.   get this other rock.
168:41:00|T|LMP|That zee-ing -  That's swinging; it really works. John's got a long way to go, Tony, before he gets that thing reeled in.
168:41:17|T|LMP|And, Tony, this rock here looks like - It's the same character as the ones up on the rim .
168:41:34|T|LMP|that great, huge black one that we sampled, except that one up there didn't have any of these holes in it. I can't really say what these holes are here.  They just look - They're vugs. Let's just call them vugs. What caused them, I don't know.
168:42:00|T|CDR|Yeah. They look more vuggy to me; although they're round.
168:42:03|T|LMP|They look like drill holes is what they look like.
168:42:05|T|CDR|Yeah, that's right. They look like - You know what they look like? They look like those -
168:42:10|T|LMP|Help me.
168:42:11|T|CDR|- they look like those holes you get in rocks where the -
168:42:16|T|LMP|Here, put those up for me.
168:42:18|T|CDR|Okay. They look like the holes that you get in rocks where you have a venting of gas that comes up through there like a long - You know what I mean, Tony?
168:42:29|C|Eng|Sure do. Sure do.
168:42:31|T|LMP|Vesicle pipe.
168:42:33|T|CDR|Yeah, vesicle pipe. That's it.
168:42:34|T|LMP|Vesicle pipes.
168:42:35|T|CDR|There you go.
168:42:40|T|LMP|Okay.
168:42:42|T|LMP|Hi, big eye.
168:42:44|C|Eng|Hi there, Charlie.
168:42:46|T|LMP|Okay, let's see.  Yeah.  Okay, John. I'll turn off the TV for you.
168:42:53|T|CDR|Okay. Let me put the scoop back.
168:43:03|T|LMP|Okay, going to 1 right now.
168:43:05|T|CDR|Roger.
168:43:09|T|LMP|- counter-clockwise. That is a beautiful little piece of gear.
168:43:21|C|Eng|Charlie, you've got about 4 minutes on the DAC -
168:43:23|T|LMP|Okay.  Can we -
168:43:24|C|Eng|- at 12 frames per second; and you can either use it that way or one frame per second, either way you want, on the way back, whichever looks best to you.
168:43:35|T|CDR|Why don't we go at one frame a second all the way back in, to the Rover ?
168:43:39|T|LMP|-
168:43:41|T|CDR|Huh?
168:43:42|T|LMP|What am I hung up on, John?
168:43:45|T|CDR|Your bag is hung up, Charlie.
168:43:46|T|LMP|Oh shoot. You know, that's probably why yours came off.
168:43:51|T|CDR|Yeah, you got to -  There you go.
168:43:55|T|LMP|Okay. Is it free now?
168:43:58|T|CDR|Let me tighten it down. There you go.
168:44:01|C|Eng|And, we'd like your frame s before you load up.
168:44:03|T|LMP|Thanks.
168:44:09|T|CDR|Let me get yours, Charlie.
168:44:11|T|LMP|Okay. I'm 6 on magazine Foxtrot, and I finished up -
168:44:17|T|CDR|I'm a 112.
168:44:18|C|Eng|Okay.
168:44:21|T|CDR|Didn't take many that time.
168:44:27|T|LMP|Boy, that Smoky Mountain -
168:44:28|T|CDR|Make that 114, Houston.
168:44:33|T|LMP|That Smoky Mountain is a steep-sided mountain, Tony.
168:45:14|T|CDR|Okay, 1, 2.  Uh-oh.
168:45:26|T|LMP|What?
168:45:27|T|CDR|I didn't shut off the TV.
168:45:28|T|LMP|I did. I got it for you.
168:45:29|T|CDR|Did you get?
168:45:30|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:45:31|T|CDR|In PMW-1?
168:45:32|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:45:33|T|CDR|Okay.
168:45:34|C|Eng|Charlie, if you haven't gotten on yet, we'd like to change that to 12 frames. Evidently, your DAC is about out of electrical power.
168:45:42|T|LMP|Okay, it's going at 12.
168:45:46|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
168:45:50|T|LMP|I'll start it when we get started, but it's on 12.
168:45:54|C|Eng|Good show.
168:45:56|T|LMP|f/4.
168:45:57|C|Eng|Okay.
168:46:00|T|LMP|Oh boy, Tony. This has been a good traverse up here -
168:46:06|C|Eng|It sure looked good down here, I'll tell you.
168:46:08|T|LMP|some spectacular scenery.
168:46:09|C|Eng|I'm sure glad we got this EVA-3 -
168:46:11|T|LMP|Hope we picked up the right rocks. I think there are two predominant types.  Yeah, me too. But there's two predominant-type rocks here, the aphanitic black-looking ones that really appear to be crystalline to me, and not necessarily lava like.
168:46:36|T|CDR|And we're going to follow our tracks. Say where Station 10 is again?
168:46:41|C|Eng|Okay. Station 10 makes a triangle -
168:46:43|T|LMP|Right behind the LM.
168:46:44|T|CDR|Okay.
168:46:43|C|Eng|- with ALSEP and the old Station 10. We'll call it Station 10 prime, and it's about 50 meters to the northwest of the old 10.
168:46:57|T|CDR|Okay.  Dadgummit, now I can't get the -
168:47:20|T|LMP|There you go.  Okay. I'll take the same set of pictures coming back, Tony -
168:47:26|T|CDR|Charlie, get your arm, you got -
168:47:27|T|LMP|Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.
168:47:30|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:48:04|T|CDR|Yeah. You know, so far on this trip, my personal estimation of Charlie's slope estimates that you can take them and double them. Every one of them.
168:48:14|T|LMP|That was always my problem.
168:48:20|T|CDR|Oh, good.
168:48:25|T|LMP|My 10 percents never added up to a hundred, John.
168:48:28|T|CDR|Yeah, but you're not exaggerating here, I'll tell you that. You're sure - you're sure under-exaggerating. Houston, this is the roughest terrain to be &quot;plains&quot; I ever saw.
168:48:40|C|Eng|Gee -
168:48:41|T|CDR|-
168:48:41|C|Eng|- we've heard that before on almost every geology trip.
168:48:44|T|CDR|- that looked like this.
168:48:48|C|Eng|I don't think the photo-geologists get close enough to their subjects.
168:48:56|T|LMP|Okay, Tony; looking back now at 2 o'clock - and we're heading 140  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">188, 3.6</a> - you can see End Crater right on the flank of Palmetto, and you can see the rim of Dot.
168:49:15|T|LMP|Palmetto is one of the highest features around, and its rim is really raised. I can see some large blocks on the north side of it that I couldn't see before. And I would estimate 2 meters or so in size.
168:49:51|T|LMP|Off to the right toward that - which we described going out - now I can see four or five 2-meter-size boulders, whitish in color, with no fillets around them.
168:50:10|C|Eng|Okay.
168:50:12|T|LMP|I guess we would be off the ejecta blanket here, wouldn't you say, John?
168:50:15|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:50:16|T|LMP|This probably is right in between the North and South Ray ejecta because there's hardly any pebbles. It's almost a completely smooth surface, maybe 2 percent, Tony, with cobbles up to 5 centimeters. An occasional 20-meter - 20-centimeter block.
168:50:46|C|Eng|As that Sun gets higher, it must be about like looking in zero phase everywhere.
168:50:53|T|CDR|Naw! The visibility gets pretty good at high Sun angles.
168:50:56|C|Eng|Good show.
168:50:57|T|CDR|It's still bad going into the Sun - Out of the Sun and into the Sun. But it's pretty good the way we're going right now.
168:51:04|C|Eng|Okay.
168:51:05|T|CDR|You want to take a picture into Palmetto, Charlie?
168:51:08|T|LMP|If we could get in there, I'd like to. Yeah, go up by Dot.
168:51:11|T|CDR|Okay.
168:51:12|T|LMP|That's going to be a pretty steep slope though.
168:51:15|T|CDR|Well, I'll tell you what. We'll go up there, and do a 360 pan. How would that be?
168:51:19|T|LMP|Okay. I'll do use one frame setting. It'll be a little off on exposure, but they'll see what it looks like.
168:51:31|T|CDR|developed a new technique for panning, Houston.  360 degrees on the Rover and clicking away. That ought to make stereo for you.
168:51:45|T|LMP|Okay, we look like we're in an old secondary area now, Tony, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj"> 191 at 3.1 </a>.
168:51:54|T|CDR|I think this is a South Ray ray.
168:51:55|T|LMP|You do?
168:51:56|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:51:57|T|LMP|Yeah, you're probably right.
168:51:59|T|CDR|A big hunk of South Ray. They're the same rocks and everything .  And we're traversing it right now. It's a big rough, big old blanket full of South Ray material.
168:52:10|T|LMP|Look at those big rocks off to the west there, John, up on the - You probably can't see them, but there are about ten stand out starkly against -
168:52:20|T|CDR|Yep. Yep.
168:52:21|T|LMP|- the sky line on the far ridge.
168:52:23|T|CDR|Yeah.
168:52:24|T|LMP|How far that is -
168:52:25|T|CDR|Yeah, there's one of those black rocks like we got out of South Ray.
168:52:26|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:52:27|T|CDR|That's a couple-of-meter black rock. Houston, we've talked about that one when we passed by it the first time. That's the same rock that we saw on the rim. That's the same class of rock, I would think, that was that big House Rock.
168:52:44|C|Eng|Hey, incidentally, -
168:52:45|T|CDR|A big house.
168:52:45|C|Eng|- we reduced the magnetometer reading now, and it's 313 gammas down, which is by far the strongest reading we've seen on the Moon.  And DAC power, Off.
168:52:57|T|LMP|Golly!
168:52:58|T|CDR|I wonder what that -
168:53:02|T|LMP|Guess we're out of power.  Dumb thing.
168:53:16|T|CDR|Well, I wouldn't be surprised but what a big impact crater wouldn't change your magnetic field some.
168:53:23|T|LMP|Tony, my impression right now could be proved totally wrong on the sample analysis, but -
168:53:35|T|CDR|Are we up on the rim of Palmetto?
168:53:37|T|LMP|No, we got a long way to go.
168:53:38|T|CDR|Oh, yeah, there it is.
168:53:39|T|LMP|See there is Dot. I mean -
168:53:40|T|CDR|Oh, yeah, yeah.
168:53:45|T|CDR|Right.
168:53:47|T|LMP|Ah, is that - I see the same characteristics in South Ray rocks as North Ray rocks, being the black and the white. The streaks up the side of the craters are basically the same. But the North Ray you got to guess at it a little bit more; and that might be totally what my guess is. It could be wrong, but I kinda think they're at least a similar rock.
168:54:26|T|LMP|That stumped them.  So crazy they didn't even answer me.
168:54:40|T|CDR|Houston, do you read? Over.
168:54:41|C|Eng|Oh, we sure do. Sorry, Charlie. We copy that.
168:54:45|T|CDR|Okay. Fine.
168:54:47|T|LMP|That's okay.
168:54:50|C|Eng|It was just mind boggling, as Freddo says here.
168:54:58|T|CDR|Sure is.  I'll tell you one thing -
168:55:05|T|LMP|Okay, I think you - I think we could make it up over there, John, if you broke right here, but I guess you want to follow the old tracks. We were pretty close to the rim there for one time.
168:55:13|T|CDR|Yeah, we'll get there.
168:55:14|T|LMP|Yeah.  We know this way works.
168:55:19|T|CDR|Yes, sir. Let's not do any R&amp;D . Unnecessarily, that is.
168:55:28|T|LMP|But, Tony, if we sample one of these very fresh craters with the indurated regolith that to me look like they're maybe the freshest thing around, can y'all date that just from the regolith? The glassy shards or whatever is in there?
168:55:51|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie.
168:55:53|T|CDR|-
168:55:57|T|LMP|I was just asking a question about whether you could date a fresh crater with the indurated regolith?
168:56:09|C|Eng|Ah, we'll work on an answer on that. I don't know, off-hand.
168:56:15|T|LMP|Okay. There's a lot of them around the rim, and I'd like to at least pick up some of that and see what y'all could do with it.
168:56:22|C|Eng|That sounds like a good idea. We've -
168:56:24|T|CDR|
168:56:24|C|Eng|- got a definite &quot;maybe&quot; from the Backroom there.
168:56:30|T|LMP|Okay. And, Tony, we're looking into End Crater, and it's a blocky crater. There are blocks inside of it, and there's some on the rim, half-meter size.
168:56:41|C|Eng|Right.
168:56:42|C|Eng|And you were asking about a stop -
168:56:42|T|LMP|And maybe 10 percent of it -  Naw, let's make it -
168:56:45|C|Eng|- we don't want to stop. We want to go on to 10-Prime.
168:56:52|T|LMP|Naw, we weren't talking about a stop. I was just describing End Crater there. It is a blocky-rim crater.
168:56:59|C|Eng|Okay, fine.
168:57:00|T|LMP|As we suspected.
168:57:10|T|CDR|How do you like this , Charlie?
168:57:11|T|LMP|It's great.
168:57:12|T|CDR|We're doing 14 clicks.
168:57:13|T|LMP|This is smooth going.  Boy, not having that fender really sprays it up there over you, doesn't it?
168:57:23|T|CDR|Yeah. It does.
168:57:24|C|Eng|And could we have an amp-hour reading -  An amp reading -
168:57:25|T|LMP|Tony, occasionally, when we hit a big bump -  40. Between 30 and 40.
168:57:33|C|Eng|Okay.
168:57:40|T|LMP|When we hit a bump, Tony, and bounce down, that rear wheel that lost the fender showers dirt all over the front of us, and that's what gets the LCRU and the camera so dirty.
168:57:59|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
168:58:22|T|LMP|Man, I'll give you - You earned your driver's license on this thing, John, I tell you.
168:58:28|C|Eng|Either that or lose it.
168:58:32|T|LMP|You know, it takes just about any terrain. It's really a remarkable machine.
168:58:37|T|CDR|Sure is climbing a slope right now, Charlie.
168:58:39|T|LMP|Yeah.
168:58:40|T|CDR|We're only doing - Got a v-max , and we're only doing 8 clicks. So you know this has got to be steep.
168:58:47|T|LMP|We're pulling a little over 40 amps, Tony.
168:58:51|C|Eng|Okay.
168:58:58|T|LMP|Don't anybody tell Ken how dirty we are.
168:59:02|T|CDR|Yeah, he won't let us in the hatch.
168:59:40|C|Eng|No, we'd better press on.
168:59:42|T|LMP|Let's go over and look at the rim, John, here.  Okay.
168:59:48|C|Eng|Incidentally, we were able to track you in the Rover on the way out with the PSE and they are able to see you now on the way back with the active seismic geophones. We'd like to be sure that you are in the same tracks you were going out.
169:00:05|T|CDR|That's true.
169:00:06|C|Eng|Okay.
169:00:07|T|CDR|True, that's true.
169:00:10|T|LMP|Hey, John.  right, babe. Look at that! Hook a right, please. Get this old pick-a-chur .  Okay, Tony. We're gonna to drive over to the rim of Palmetto, which is a pretty good sight.
169:00:34|C|Eng|Okay.
169:00:36|T|LMP|And, we see some blocks on the inner rim; but nothing that really appears to be outcrop. But it's really a deep crater, Tony. It's -
169:00:53|T|CDR|I don't see the bottom.
169:00:54|T|LMP|We can't see the bottom, and we're right on the rim. It must be a 100 meters or so deep.
169:01:01|T|CDR|Pictures of it, Charlie?
169:01:02|T|LMP|No, I didn't get it. I thought we were going to do a 1 - 3 - 180 -
169:01:05|T|CDR|Okay. Here we go.
169:01:30|T|CDR|Okay.
169:01:31|T|LMP|Okay. We're heading out, Tony.
169:01:33|C|Eng|Okay.
169:01:35|T|LMP|And the rim here is cobbly. I wouldn't say it's blocky, but it's cobbly.
169:01:43|T|CDR|I think we've been averaging 11 kilometers , Houston.
169:01:47|C|Eng|Okay.
169:01:51|T|LMP|Look at that view back towards South Ray, isn't that spectacular?
169:01:55|C|Eng|Looking ahead -
169:01:56|T|CDR|Baby Ray.
169:01:57|C|Eng|- at your tracks, could you tell when you picked up the softer regolith? On the tracks that you came out?
169:02:06|T|LMP|They've all looked the same. Haven't they to you, John?
169:02:10|T|CDR|Softer regolith coming out from the LM?
169:02:17|C|Eng|Right, you -
169:02:18|T|CDR|We're keeping up on it, Charlie.
169:02:19|C|Eng|- mentioned up on North Ray that you only went in -
169:02:20|T|LMP|Yeah.
169:02:21|C|Eng|- an eighth of an inch or so.
169:02:26|T|CDR|Naw, the regolith does change character right past the LM, and it's a lot less blocky, you know? I think this ray right here -
169:02:30|T|LMP|I think this is probably - Yeah, it's probably ray . Yeah.  Either that or it came out of Palmetto.
169:02:48|T|CDR|This would have been a good choice for a walking traverse . See over there in the west, over there in the far rim over there? Don't you see something that looks like - Down in that ledge down there.
169:03:07|T|LMP|Yeah. There are two spots over there that might be outcrop, Tony. There's -
169:03:14|T|CDR|Well, that's probably a secondary from - That's probably a big block clot from -
169:03:20|T|LM Crew|From North Ray.
169:03:21|T|LMP|Yeah.
169:03:22|T|CDR|Yeah. That's what it is. See there -
169:03:23|T|LMP|I don't -
169:03:24|T|CDR|It's hit in there and -
169:03:25|T|LMP|Yeah. There's one further around, though on the southwest rim, John, that sticks out like it's eroded away from underneath it.
169:03:34|T|CDR|Yeah.
169:03:35|T|LMP|That has a hint of bedrock. But it's - And that's about on the southwest rim, about 20 percent down from the upper rim of Palmetto, Tony.
169:03:46|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
169:03:50|T|LMP|But it's just one little isolated block. And I don't really think it means much. Still can't see the LM. We're on the -
169:04:02|T|CDR|See South Ray, though. Get a picture.
169:04:04|T|LMP|I'm getting them; as fast as I can pull the trigger.
169:04:14|T|LMP|We thought we'd be able to see the rim from here, Tony, but you can't do it - I mean the LM, but you can't do it.  That thing says <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="alsj">194 for 1.4</a>. I bet you that's right.  We came farther east .
169:04:40|T|CDR|Yeah. We're way east.
169:04:43|T|LMP|Yeah.  Okay, Tony. Between <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623nlbl.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">Gator and Palmetto</a> -
169:04:48|T|CDR|Uh-oh.
169:04:49|T|LMP|Uh-oh. Ah! We missed it.
169:04:51|T|CDR|Ahh, good suspension.
169:04:53|T|LMP|Yeah.
169:04:55|C|Eng|Well, we're all holding on to our chairs.
169:04:57|T|LMP|Between Gator and Palmetto -  We almost hit a great big rock, but old Percy , here, avoided it.  Look at that.  194, John, takes us right out our tracks.  Between Gator and Palmetto, Tony, there's a swale - a depression - that runs east-west that is apparently more cratered and fresher craters there than what we've been driving on between Palmetto and North Ray.
169:05:44|C|Eng|Roger.
169:05:46|T|CDR|I just finished my 2 pounds of potassium .
169:05:51|T|LMP|You finished your 2 pounds already?
169:05:53|T|CDR|Yeah. I don't know whether I'm driving or sloshing.
169:05:57|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
169:05:58|T|LMP|Don't let's go unstable with a fuel slosh mode.
169:06:02|T|CDR|That's right.  My fuel slosh problem is getting to be something fierce.
169:06:10|C|Eng|And the Command Module just did their plane change burn, and it's a good burn.
169:06:16|T|LMP|Good.
169:06:17|T|CDR|-
169:06:27|T|LMP|Ah, the old -   Man; we are showered .
169:06:41|T|CDR|Yeah.
169:07:07|T|CDR|How many gammas did you say that LSM was, Tony? 300 and some?
169:07:12|C|Eng|313.
169:07:16|T|CDR|How many times higher than that - That's 10 times higher than what the Apollo 12 guys got, isn't it?
169:07:26|C|Eng|No, it's not that much greater. It's about 100 more than they got on Apollo 14.
169:07:35|T|CDR|Yeah. That's what I thought. Well, the magnetic field of the Moon, in places, is a lot more than anybody ever believed it would be.
169:07:44|C|Eng|That's right. From lunar orbit, it only looks like - From high lunar orbit, it only looks like 2 or 3 gamma, at most.
169:07:56|T|CDR|Which one?
169:07:57|T|LMP|Off to 2 o'clock. It has no rim to it -
169:08:00|T|CDR|Can't see too good - Yeah. I see what you're saying there.
169:08:02|T|LMP|See what I'm saying?
169:08:03|T|CDR|A sink-hole type
169:08:04|T|LMP|Looks like a sink hole; a big doodlebug hole.
169:08:08|T|LMP|And that's, Tony, at our 2 o'clock, and we're presently at 0.9 at 198.
169:08:13|C|Eng|Rog. We know exactly which one you're talking about.
169:08:15|T|LMP|It's only about 100 meters or so from us.
169:08:17|C|Eng|Is it on top of a little dome?
169:08:23|T|CDR|Yeah. We are.
169:08:24|T|LMP|Yeah. We are.
169:08:25|C|Eng|Okay; understand.
169:08:28|T|LMP|That crater I'm - Yahoo!!! Boy!
169:08:33|C|Eng|And you left the ground again.
169:08:38|T|LMP|No, we almost - We spun out on my side.
169:08:44|T|CDR|That's it. We're going -
169:09:07|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
169:09:11|T|LMP|Can we do a three -
169:09:15|T|CDR|How about right here?
169:09:16|T|LMP|Yeah. That's great.  Or 90/270; either one.
169:09:30|T|CDR|Now.
169:09:32|T|LMP|Make it about a 115/270. A little bit further right, John. That's good. Now you can go back .
169:09:41|T|CDR|Okay. Here we go. Got it?
169:09:43|T|LMP|I got it. Okay?
169:09:54|T|CDR|And 190 at 0.7; 198 at 0.7 is the crater that Charlie's talking about.
169:10:02|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.
169:10:12|T|CDR|And that's not on the map, either. It doesn't even show up. I guess my opinion of this place is that on our traverse maps, the rimless features - the very old, subdued, rimless craters - they just don't even show up , and they're just not there, hardly.
169:10:34|T|LMP|That's right.
169:10:36|T|CDR|I mean unless they've got a raised rim, they don't make it. They don't show up in photography, apparently.
169:10:44|T|LMP|Tony, that sink hole or whatever it was -  subdued crater we passed back there - is really deep. I'm surprised - I really don't have a map right here with me, but it was probably 20 - 40 meters deep or so.
169:11:05|C|Eng|Right. We've got it on the map here.
169:11:06|T|LMP|We couldn't see the bottom of it.
169:11:11|T|CDR|This is an absolutely great suspension system, Houston. You should see some of the things we've run through, and this baby just bounces right out and keeps right on going.
169:11:22|T|LMP|Okay. The Nav is 196 at 0.5.
169:11:24|T|LMP|We ought to see the old beauty when we top the rise here.  John just ran over a basketball-size rock with the right wheel and just - There she is, John!
169:11:41|C|Eng|Well, that's good news.
169:12:00|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie.
169:12:01|T|LMP|Okay. It 's 0.4. We're about 20 meters up - 30 meters up above it, Tony.
169:12:12|C|Eng|Okay. If you can recognize -
169:12:14|T|CDR|Here's another real fresh one .
169:12:15|C|Eng|- an edge of the ray in the neighborhood of 50 meters north of the ALSEP area, that would be a good place to pick Station 10-Prime.  Our photo shows the edge of the ray in there.
169:12:30|T|CDR|That would be a good place to look for it from, Charlie, right up here.
169:12:34|T|LMP|Does he want to <i>pick</i> a ray?
169:12:36|T|CDR|Pick the <i>edge</i> of a ray, 50 meters north of an ALSEP site - of <i>the</i> ALSEP site.   Tony, I just don't - You can't hardly tell where one - They're not as distinct - The gradational pattern is just too gradual -
169:12:57|C|Eng|Okay. -
169:12:58|T|CDR|- You just can't -
169:12:58|C|Eng|- We sure understand. -
169:13:00|T|CDR|- especially when -
169:13:00|C|Eng|- And just pick a site 50 meters north and we'll call that 10-Prime.
169:13:06|T|CDR|Okay.
169:13:17|T|LMP|Tony, we must be out of battery power because this camera - this DAC - stopped running -
169:13:24|C|Eng|Okay; understand.
169:13:26|T|LMP|- with about 50 percent of the mag left.
169:13:27|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine.  I guess our calculations were right.
169:13:36|T|LMP|Another picture? Okay. Back a little bit?
169:13:48|T|LMP|I can't believe that big hole there. I just can't believe it; right behind her.
169:13:57|T|CDR|It might be that -
169:13:58|T|LMP|Hook a right, John. Let me get another picture of old Orion. There we go.
169:14:12|T|LMP|Might be what, John? You know that might be an end of a ray right there. See that. It's almost a blockless feature.
169:14:17|T|CDR|Yeah.
169:14:18|T|LMP|That might be just due to the downslope though.  Don't run into our home.
169:14:26|T|CDR|Right, Charlie.
169:14:30|T|LMP|Home again, home again! Jiggety jig!
169:14:32|T|CDR|Fifty meters - Where do you want to park this thing, Houston? Fifty meters from the AL -
169:14:40|T|LMP|To the northeast.
169:14:41|T|CDR|To the northeast. Yeah.
169:14:42|T|LMP|Or, northwest.
169:14:43|C|Eng|Rog.
169:14:44|T|LMP|That would be over this little ridge here.
169:14:46|T|CDR|Right by that big rock.
169:14:50|C|Eng|Okay.  we're looking for in the sampling here those vesicular basalts that you both described in the area.  And also we -
169:15:04|T|LMP|Okay. That might be one right over there, John. It's the bluish -
169:15:15|C|Eng|And to make a triangle -
169:15:15|T|CDR|What heading do you want to park on, Houston?
169:15:17|C|Eng|- with the other double core and deep core.
169:15:17|T|CDR|Park on a heading of 180?
169:15:20|T|LMP|Yeah, or north. I can - Either way.
169:15:52|C|Eng|Okay. Copy that.
169:16:00|T|LMP|Ahh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Come out, foot. There we go.
169:16:08|T|LMP|Got it. Okay. Wait a minute, and I'll give you the Rover readings when I dust things off.
169:16:12|C|Eng|Okay.
169:16:20|T|LMP|Okay. We're 180, 188, 11.1, 0.1, 30, 120, off-scale low, off-scale low on the amp; batt temps - Looks like we had a failure on batt temp 1. It's belly up off-scale low. Let me whack it once. Nope. Batt 2 is 140. Left front is 225; 210 Right front 225.
169:17:10|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie.
169:17:18|T|LMP|Okay. And I'm starting out with frame count 80 magazine Foxtrot. Now, you want me to get a pan, Tony?
169:17:25|C|Eng|Yeah -
169:17:26|T|LMP|
169:17:29|C|Eng|- And after that, we'll go on with a rake soil at this site.
169:17:35|T|LMP|You want a double core?
169:17:40|T|CDR|Charlie, where is the Earth? Should be right straight up.
169:17:44|T|LMP|Nope, not quite. That's better.
169:17:54|T|LMP|Let's see. No, you've got to go right some, John. More.
169:18:01|T|CDR|There we go.
169:18:04|T|LMP|Okay. That ought to be in the site.
169:18:19|T|LMP|Right. Now down a little bit. That ought to be it.
169:18:25|T|CDR|That's it.
169:18:26|T|LMP|That's 4.35.
169:18:28|C|Eng|Okay.
169:18:30|T|LMP|See it in the sight?
169:18:31|T|CDR|Yeah. Man, is it -
169:18:33|T|LMP|Okay.
169:18:37|C|Eng|Okay. And when you're on the console there, could you tap that Amp-Hour meter and see if you can get that lower one to come up some?
169:18:50|T|LMP|I banged the control panel hard, Tony, and none of the meters changed.
169:18:56|T|CDR|Uh-oh.
169:18:57|C|Eng|Okay.
169:19:12|T|CDR|you believe that?
169:19:14|T|LMP|The one in training never would stay on.
169:19:21|T|CDR|Agh. Okay.
169:19:22|T|LMP|Okay, you moved the antenna, John.
169:19:30|C|Eng|All right. We lost our picture.
169:19:34|T|CDR|-
169:19:56|T|LMP|Okay. Here I come. No, you've got it pointed up too straight.  Okay. It needs to come left; left; more left; more, more; okay.  Now down just a skosh. That's it - Now left.
169:20:23|T|CDR|That's beautiful.
169:20:24|T|LMP|Okay.
169:20:26|T|CDR|It 's very dim 'til it gets near the center.
169:20:33|T|CDR|such a shrimp, I can't get my head up in there.
169:20:35|T|LMP|Tony, a double core here, too?
169:20:37|C|Eng|Right. We'll need a double core.
169:20:42|T|LMP|You cut out. Say again?
169:20:44|C|Eng|Yes, we would like a double core -
169:20:48|T|CDR|
169:20:48|C|Eng|The rake soil is first priority and then the double core.
169:20:52|T|LMP|Okay.
169:21:01|T|LMP|Huh?  Oh!
169:21:05|T|CDR|Okay. The Velcro on the side - The glue on the Velcro on the sunshield is - Whatever it does. It's probably the same glue you used on the padded bags, because they came loose, too.
169:21:20|C|Eng|Okay.
169:21:21|T|CDR|You want this sunshield on there, or do you want us to take it off and throw it away?
169:21:25|C|Eng|Well, if it's doing any good at all, let's just leave it on. It doesn't seem to be in the picture.
169:21:32|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay, I'm gonna put the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> under my seat. I don't want to go through that again.
169:21:58|T|LMP|Oh, rats! I dropped the -
169:22:02|T|CDR|I'll come help you, Charlie.
169:22:03|T|LMP|Dropped the gnomon right where I wanted to sample.  There we go.  Ah, the big eye is looking the wrong way.
169:22:18|T|LMP|Okay. Boy, I just can't see anything when I get this camera in my shadow.
169:22:24|T|CDR|That's a good place , Charlie.
169:22:31|T|LMP|f/4; f/8 for the cross-Sun.
169:22:36|T|LMP|How long is this stop, Tony?
169:22:38|C|Eng|Okay. This is a 30-minute stop.
169:22:43|T|LMP|Okay.  Home again, home again!  Look at that regolith.
169:22:11|T|LMP|We've got some glass-coated frags here, Tony -
169:23:13|C|Eng|Okay.
169:23:14|T|LMP|- in the rake. I don't see anything that looks like -
169:23:19|T|CDR|Get another -
169:23:20|T|LMP|Okay. That was about a half a bagful one scoop .
169:23:30|T|CDR|Bag's full. All right.
169:23:33|T|LMP|Uh-oh! Uh-oh!  Okay, Tony. Out of that scoop, we lost the two biggest rocks. I poured too fast.
169:23:46|T|CDR|I didn't bag fast enough, Charlie.
169:23:53|T|LMP|They just don't stop in this gravity field once they get moving. Okay. There we go, John.
169:24:01|T|CDR|hold the bags for a second?
169:24:03|T|LMP|Yeah. I got bags on my camera here we could have used.
169:24:10|T|CDR|Okay. That's in bag number 347.
169:24:13|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 347.
169:24:20|T|LMP|Okay.  get an &quot;after&quot;, John?
169:24:23|T|CDR|Yeah, I'll get it.
169:24:30|T|CDR|Okay. 7 . &quot;After.&quot;
169:24:37|T|LMP|Old &quot;after&quot;!
169:24:38|C|Eng|Right. We're going to want a rake soil, over in the area of the old Station 10, also. So it's up to you whether it's easiest to go get it now or to get the double core now.  After you're through with this one .
169:24:51|T|CDR|Let's get the soil, Charlie.
169:24:52|T|LMP|We'll get the soil.
169:24:54|T|LMP|Okay, I think it would be easier to go get it, John, because I've got to take -
169:24:58|T|LMP|To do the double core -
169:25:00|T|CDR|Right; I agree with you.
169:25:01|T|LMP|- I got to take this thing apart. We could -
169:25:09|C|Eng|That's a good idea, Charlie. Then you won't need the rake anymore.
169:25:14|T|LMP|Yeah.
169:25:16|T|LMP|Okay. There's a two -
169:25:21|T|CDR|Okay, and that's going into bag 348.  348, Houston.
169:25:25|C|Eng|Okay; 348.
169:25:38|T|LMP|That 's just right over the ridge there about 50 meters, isn't it?
169:25:41|C|Eng|Yeah, it should be.
169:25:42|T|CDR|What's that, Charlie?
169:25:43|T|LMP|That old Station 10.
169:25:44|T|CDR|Yeah.
169:25:50|T|LMP|Ah, the old orange . Okay, get an &quot;after&quot; of that, John - scoop.
169:25:56|T|LMP|How about swapping; I'll bag, and you rake.
169:25:59|T|CDR|Yeah. Let's do that.
169:26:01|T|LMP|Okay, I'll get the gnomon.
169:26:04|T|CDR|Why don't you let me get the gnomon. I'll drop it over there, because I can get down a lot easier.
169:26:06|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
169:26:12|T|CDR|No.
169:26:13|T|LMP|got it.
169:26:14|T|CDR|It didn't -
169:26:18|T|LMP|The old Station 10 -
169:26:19|C|Eng|You got that down smooth, John.
169:26:21|T|LMP|That was -  Yeah.
169:26:29|T|CDR|See these neat little craters? You just run right through them.  There's a lot of tracks around there, Charlie. That must be the old Station 10 right there.
169:26:47|T|LMP|It's right over here. It is, yeah. Here's where we took the double - You want it where we had the double core, Tony?
169:26:55|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie? The double core will be at this rake site, but while you've got the rake out there -
169:27:01|T|LMP|You want it -
169:27:02|C|Eng|- we might as well get the rake at the old double core.
169:27:05|T|LMP|No, I meant -  That's what I'm saying. This is the old double core site; we'll rake here.
169:27:13|C|Eng|That's exactly what we want.
169:27:17|T|LMP|Okay. We're within 3 meters of it.
169:27:22|T|CDR|Be a good place.
169:27:44|T|CDR|Sun.
169:27:51|T|CDR|Okay, you &quot;locating&quot; it, Charlie?
169:28:07|T|LMP|Okay, we're sacking into 349.
169:28:10|C|Eng|Okay, bag 349.
169:28:20|T|LMP|Not - John's got two rakes full.
169:28:25|T|LMP|Not nearly as productive over here.
169:28:29|C|Eng|Okay. You're probably on a different part of the ray, then. That's good.
169:28:36|T|CDR|It is, huh?
169:28:39|T|LMP|Two scoops and we got three little frags. One of them just dropped out.
169:28:44|T|CDR|Three is all we got?
169:28:46|T|LMP|Two! One of them dropped out.
169:28:49|T|CDR|Oh. That ain't very good.
169:28:53|T|LMP|Tells them something.
169:29:04|T|LMP|There's a couple more.
169:29:14|T|LMP|Okay?
169:29:16|T|CDR|Okay, let me get one more , Charlie.
169:29:17|T|LMP|Okay.
169:29:35|T|CDR|-
169:29:36|T|LMP|He had about 20 pounds of soil, Tony, and he came up with one little frag. And it - We just dropped it.
169:29:44|T|CDR|And Charlie dropped it.
169:29:45|T|LMP|That's enough.
169:29:46|T|CDR|Yeah.
169:29:47|C|Eng|Yeah, let's just call that our rake sample.
169:29:54|C|Eng|Okay.
169:29:57|T|LMP|Okay, we need a soil sample, John.
169:29:59|T|CDR|Okay.
169:30:25|T|LMP|That's great.
169:30:26|T|CDR|Okay. Let me get one more scoopful -
169:30:28|T|LMP|Okay.
169:30:38|T|CDR|Okay.
169:30:39|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, how about -
169:30:42|T|CDR|Get a little &quot;after&quot; here.
169:30:51|T|LMP|Hold that one and put it in my bag while I &quot;zee&quot; this one up.
169:31:05|T|LMP|Okay. I think we got about 10 bags left, and that's it.
169:31:13|C|Eng|Okay. Was that bag 350? We didn't get a number.
169:31:22|T|LMP|Yeah; 350, Tony. It was.
169:31:24|C|Eng|Okay.
169:31:30|T|LMP|What are you supposed to be doing while I do the double core?
169:31:32|T|CDR|I'm supposed to be sampling.
169:31:34|C|Eng|Right. Be looking around for exotics -
169:31:37|T|CDR|the double core.
169:31:38|T|LMP|Yeah, I know.
169:31:39|C|Eng|- especially things like that vesicular basalt you described.
169:31:48|T|CDR|- , Charlie.
169:31:50|T|LMP|That is a hard rock right there, John.
169:31:59|T|CDR|Now, Charlie.   -  Okay.
169:32:11|T|CDR|Let me get it. Let me get it. Just move -
169:32:13|T|LMP|I got it with the rake. You want to - I got to go get - Why don't you take that and put it in my sack, and I'll go over and get the double core.
169:32:23|T|CDR|Why don't you carry this one over there and throw it in the big bag.
169:32:26|T|LMP|Okay, I'll do it. Okay, Tony, I just whacked off one that I thought it was basaltic looking, but it turns out it's glassy with the white matrix in it.
169:32:49|T|CDR|Charlie, here you go.
169:32:50|T|LMP|Okay.
169:33:13|T|LMP|Hey, John?
169:33:14|T|CDR|Yeah.
169:33:22|T|CDR|Yeah, that's a big one.
169:33:23|T|LMP|See it right there.
169:33:24|T|CDR|Yeah.
169:34:31|T|CDR|Where are your bags, Charlie?
169:34:32|T|LMP|Right here on my camera.
169:34:35|T|CDR|How about letting me have them.
169:34:36|T|LMP|Okay. Well. Here's a couple that are torn off, you could use. One and -
169:34:46|T|CDR|That son of a gun must be solid. That's -
169:34:48|T|LMP|There you go.
169:34:51|T|CDR|Houston, this glass ball that I've got doesn't have any give to it.
169:34:58|C|Eng|Okay.
169:35:02|T|CDR|Going into bag 380.
169:35:08|C|Eng|Okay, 380.
169:35:10|T|LMP|Okay; double core's assembled. Give me the -
169:35:14|T|CDR|In fact - Well, it's smooth on one side and has impact pits on the other. What do you need, Charlie?
169:35:21|T|LMP|The scoop. I mean the rake.  Pardon me.
169:35:27|C|Eng|Okay, and you've got about 17 minutes left here.
169:35:32|T|CDR|Now, you're talking.
169:35:47|T|LMP|You through with the rake, John?
169:35:48|T|CDR|Yes, sir!
169:35:50|T|LMP|Tony, we through with the rake?
169:35:52|C|Eng|Yeah, we sure are.
169:35:58|T|LMP|Okay. Here it goes! Agh!  Look at that beauty go.
169:36:20|T|LMP|Okay. Hammer, hammer. There's the hammer.
169:36:25|T|CDR|Okay, I'm gonna take these two big rocks and put them in the big rock bag, Charlie.
169:36:29|T|LMP|Okay, does that - Muley's got to go in there, too.
169:36:33|T|CDR|Okay.
169:36:46|T|LMP|Well, this looks like as good as any.   Okay, Tony. I pushed it in almost three-quarters of the way on the bottom core.
169:36:58|C|Eng|Okay.
169:37:00|T|CDR|Now, I'd like to hammer that one, Charlie.
169:37:04|T|CDR|What do you need?
169:37:07|T|CDR|Okay.
169:37:08|T|LMP|- camera.
169:37:13|C|Eng|And, John, while you're looking around there, our number 1 priority is a vesicular basalt.
169:37:21|T|CDR|Yeah. Understand.  I bet we ain't gonna find one.
169:37:45|T|LMP|Grrr! Go in.
169:37:50|C|Eng|You're doing real good there, Charlie.
169:38:11|T|CDR|- film setting.
169:38:15|T|LMP|About f/11 or so.
169:38:16|T|CDR|That's f/11.
169:38:20|C|Eng|Smile, Charlie.
169:38:21|T|CDR|Got it.
169:38:22|T|LMP|Okay.
169:38:49|T|CDR|Well, I could correctly identify this rock as out of North Ray. No, I can't.
169:38:54|T|CDR|It sure looks like that rock that we saw.
169:39:10|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. At the bottom of this core, it looks whitish. And it's pretty coarse-grained. It's not real fine. It's sort of like a crumbly, shocked rock.
169:39:48|T|CDR|Well, Houston, I'm looking, but I'm not seeing any vesicular basalts.
169:39:52|C|Eng|Okay. After you get this core packed up, why don't you drive on back to the LM to the normal closeout position, and we'll let you sample around there. See if you can find one around there. You described something in a crater behind the LM.
169:40:10|T|CDR|Okay.
169:40:53|T|LMP|Okay. The bottom was 32, Tony. Top is 27.
169:40:57|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
169:42:07|C|Eng|Sounds to me like you fellows are going to have your rock quota.
169:42:17|T|LMP|I think we'll do all right.
169:42:19|C|Eng|I sure think so.
169:42:37|C|Eng|Okay.
169:42:38|T|CDR|The clasts were very dark.
169:42:47|T|CDR|Want this to go in your bag, Charlie?
169:42:49|T|LMP|Yeah, why don't you -
169:42:50|T|CDR|Or put it in my bag?
169:42:51|T|LMP|Stick it in mine. I think we got plenty of room in mine.
169:42:56|T|CDR|Okay. Yours is about full.
169:43:01|T|LMP|we got any bags left?
169:43:04|T|CDR|No, I don't see any.
169:43:06|T|LMP|You out of bags, too?
169:43:07|T|CDR|Yeah. That's really bad, isn't it?
169:43:11|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
169:43:12|T|CDR|I dropped one over here. I'll go back and get it.
169:43:14|T|LMP|Wait, here's some.
169:43:16|T|CDR|Got some?
169:43:17|T|LMP|Yeah, here's a whole kit full.
169:43:24|T|CDR|Give me one.
169:43:25|T|LMP|Okay.  Got it.
169:43:33|T|CDR|Okay.
169:43:36|T|LMP|Oops.
169:43:38|T|CDR|How much time we got here, Tony?
169:43:42|C|Eng|Say again, Charlie?
169:43:44|C|Eng|Roger. You have plenty of time here, but we'd like you to drive on back to the LM.
169:43:46|T|CDR|Okay, how much -  Okay.
169:43:51|T|LMP|Okay, I'm gonna run over , Tony, and look around and see if I can find what you want.
169:43:56|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
169:43:58|C|Eng|And, John, when you drive over we don't have to reconfigure the LCRU. Just drive it the way it is and then re-align and brush it off when you got there.
169:44:07|T|CDR|All right, will.
169:44:41|T|LMP|You know, that UV's been looking right at me.
169:44:59|T|LMP|Okay, basalts. Where are you?
169:46:17|C|Eng|Okay, was that bag one-one-three?
169:46:22|T|CDR|Thirteen.
169:46:24|C|Eng|Okay.
169:47:50|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds good, Charlie.
169:47:51|T|LMP|There are some of the rocks that I call vesicular basalts around here, but I don't know whether what I really called was correct or not. That might have led y'all astray.
169:48:07|C|Eng|That's okay. We've got -
169:48:09|T|LMP|It might have been just the glass coating on the rock.
169:48:12|C|Eng|We've got about 10 more minutes of sampling, so why don't you just pick up what looks interesting to you there, and then we'll start closing out.
169:48:23|T|LMP|Okay.
169:48:31|T|LMP|John, you bringing the machine down here?
169:48:33|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
169:48:34|T|LMP|I got my hands full of bags and rocks.
169:48:42|T|CDR|I'm gonna take it to the closeout place, Charlie, I'll -
169:48:46|T|LMP|Yeah; right. I'll come over there.
169:48:53|T|CDR|Houston, you still got lock?
169:48:55|C|Eng|No, we've lost the picture; -
169:48:57|T|CDR|Probably not, huh?
169:48:57|C|Eng|- we can hear you, though.
169:49:11|T|CDR|Man, if we had landed anywhere but where we did, we might have been in serious trouble.  I can't get over it. I'd have hated to work on any of those slopes.
169:49:47|C|Eng|Sounds good.
169:49:49|T|LMP|It's about half-of-a-grapefruit size.
169:50:40|T|LMP|Tony, do you read? Over.
169:50:42|C|Eng|Sure do, Charlie.
169:50:47|T|LMP|Okay. Did you copy that about this rock I picked up? A half-grapefruit size?
169:50:51|C|Eng|Yeah, we sure did. It sounds very interesting.
169:50:57|T|LMP|Okay, and it's going in bag 17.
169:50:59|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 17.
169:51:05|T|CDR|I don't think we need the gnomon anymore, Charlie.
169:51:07|T|LMP|No, we sure don't, John.
169:51:11|T|CDR|Want me to re-align that LCRU , Houston?
169:51:14|C|Eng|That would be fine, John.
169:51:21|T|CDR|Okay.
169:51:29|T|LMP|Did you say my SCB's about full, John?
169:51:32|T|CDR|Yep.
169:51:33|T|LMP|Okay. Let me get yours off your back right now so I can go use it to sample with.
169:51:37|T|CDR|Okay.
169:51:41|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.
169:51:45|T|CDR|GCA me - , Charlie.
169:51:46|T|LMP|Okay. Wait a minute. Okay. You got to come right. A lot. More, now - More. Now up. Now right.  Okay, right - You see them?
169:52:02|T|CDR|No.
169:52:03|T|LMP|Okay, right. Okay, right. They ought to be in there now.
169:52:08|C|Eng|Yeah, we're getting a picture.
169:52:11|T|CDR|Maybe I don't -
169:52:14|T|LMP|Let me -
169:52:15|T|CDR|I can't do nothing with it.
169:52:18|T|LMP|Okay.
169:52:29|C|Eng|We lost it again.
169:52:30|T|LMP|Got to go down a little more. No.  Wait a minute.
169:52:49|T|CDR|Man, I don't see them.  - see them?
169:52:52|T|LMP|Pretty far up there.
169:52:55|T|CDR|Okay, I got them about in azimuth.
169:53:01|T|CDR|Oh, yeah. I see them; and you need to come more to your - There you go. You ought to have one -  I can't see it. It's not -
169:53:25|T|LMP|- know how to do it.
169:53:29|T|CDR|Now, you just tilted the whole works, Charlie.
169:53:31|T|LMP|Yeah, I know it. Wait a minute. I'll go get it from this side. Push it over towards me, John. Give me the handle.
169:53:44|T|CDR|Okay.  This way.
169:53:54|T|LMP|Okay. Pull it - Dadgum.  we're having so much trouble with it this time? Hey, you got a signal that's about -
169:54:05|C|Eng|Hey! There, we've got a picture.
169:54:07|T|LMP|- 3.1, 3.2.  Leave it there; that's good enough.
169:54:12|T|CDR|- ?
169:54:13|T|LMP|Just leave it. It's 3.2 - That's 3.2.
169:54:16|C|Eng|Yeah, let's just live with that.
169:54:17|T|LMP|Okay, it 's going down. That's 3.5, John. It looks good.
169:54:23|T|CDR|Okay.
169:54:24|T|LMP|Okay.  spend 20 minutes adjusting the TV and then turn it off .  Going back out to the right, here, .
169:55:16|C|Eng|Okay. And, John, when you're ready, I've got a new UV- setting.
169:55:20|T|CDR|Okay. We'll reset the UV.
169:55:23|C|Eng|And, Charlie, you can continue sampling for about five more minutes, and then we'll have to load up.
169:55:31|T|LMP|Okay. That's about three samples. I'll be about out of bags then, anyway.
169:55:38|C|Eng|Okay.
169:56:01|T|LMP|Tony, I'll say one thing, that the character of the regolith has really changed between here and Stone Mountain and -
169:56:09|T|CDR|Okay, Houston -
169:56:10|C|Eng|Okay.
169:56:11|T|CDR|- I'm going to reset.
169:56:12|C|Eng|Okay, and your azimuth is 275, and the elevation is 66.
169:56:20|T|CDR|275 and 66. All righty.
169:56:25|T|LMP|Okay; there's a grab sample in 18.
169:56:27|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 18.
169:56:33|T|LMP|Well, it's partially documented, I should say, not a grab sample.
169:56:36|C|Eng|Right. We've got it on TV. The big eye's on ya!
169:56:44|T|LMP|The big eye!
169:56:54|T|CDR|Okay, 275 -
169:56:56|C|Eng|Roger.
169:56:57|T|CDR|- and 66.
169:56:58|C|Eng|Okay. That's affirmative.
169:57:03|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. After this rock, we'd like you to start closing out.
169:57:10|T|LMP|Okay. I'll do it.  Bag number 19, Tony.
169:57:20|C|Eng|Okay. Bag 19.
169:57:31|T|LMP|And, Tony, the last one I pick up is a igneous rock, no breccia.
169:57:37|C|Eng|Hey, outstanding!
169:57:38|T|LMP|I am not kidding. And it's got lath crystals in it and a black matrix, but it is not basaltic.
169:57:50|C|Eng|Outstanding, Charlie.
169:58:01|T|LMP|Well, it was going in bag 19; it's not anymore.
169:58:04|T|CDR|I'll come over and help you, Charlie.
169:58:05|T|LMP|No, I got it, John. It's in bag number 20, Tony.
169:58:09|C|Eng|Okay; bag 20.
169:58:13|T|LMP|He wants us to close out now, John.
169:58:16|T|CDR|Okay.
169:58:30|T|CDR|Houston, this dust is just like an abrasive. Any time you rub something, you can no longer read it. And that's what's happened to our RCUs and our - every piece of gear we've got. In other words, it's a mistake to rub something to clean it off.
169:58:52|C|Eng|Understand.
169:58:53|T|CDR|Big mistake.
169:59:00|C|Eng|Okay, we're starting a little bit ahead of time on the closeout here, and we'd like you to take your time and make sure we get everything.
169:59:10|T|CDR|Okay. So would we.
169:59:12|T|LMP|You can bet we're not going to leave anything.
169:59:16|C|Eng|Good show.
169:59:28|T|LMP|Okay.  Okay, Tony. The core tubes are going in bag number 7.
169:59:36|C|Eng|Okay. Core tubes in bag 7.
169:59:47|T|LMP|And it's hardly got any rocks in it. John, you want to off-load mine?
169:59:52|T|CDR|Okay.
170:00:07|T|LMP|- here. &quot;EMU malfunctions,&quot; I don't want that page.
170:00:18|T|LMP|Okay, LRV config - We got -
170:00:22|T|CDR|Huh?  Okay, Charlie, here you go.
170:00:25|T|LMP|Okay.
170:00:26|T|CDR|What we gonna do with it? Put it on -
170:00:27|T|LMP|Just put it in there, and I'll fill up the rocks.
170:00:30|T|LMP|Want to pull my PLSS tool carrier?
170:00:32|T|CDR|Better believe it.
170:00:34|T|LMP|harness.
170:00:35|T|CDR|Best day of my life.
170:00:37|T|LMP|Okay.
170:00:42|T|LMP|get yours. I'm glad we didn't have an emergency;  &quot;quick release pin&quot;.
170:00:56|C|Eng|And -
170:00:57|T|LMP|There you go. That's the one that we couldn't get snapped inside -
170:01:00|C|Eng|John -
170:01:01|T|LMP|John -
170:01:01|C|Eng|- you might try to keep a hold of the sample bags for when you go out and park the Rover. We may have you pick up a rock and put it on the LPM.
170:01:11|T|CDR|Oh, yeah. I forgot all about that.  You want me - I'll take my camera with me, too.
170:01:21|C|Eng|Rog.
170:01:22|T|CDR|Charlie's camera 1. You got any pictures left?
170:01:28|T|LMP|Yeah; have you?
170:01:29|T|CDR|No.
170:01:30|T|LMP|You out completely?
170:01:31|T|CDR|No, no. I'm on frame 150. I guess I got enough to cover it.
170:01:34|T|LMP|Oh, you got enough. Yeah. You're not gonna drive out there yet, are you?
170:01:39|T|CDR|Oh, no.
170:02:02|T|CDR|You got some bags, Charlie?
170:02:05|T|LMP|They - I threw them away, John. They said they were through with them. They're down -
170:02:08|T|CDR|Okay. Well, here's one right over here.
170:02:09|T|LMP|They're down to the left of the LM, there.
170:02:11|T|CDR|Here's one right over here.
170:02:24|T|LMP|Okay. I got to go get that SRC.
170:02:42|T|CDR|Okay.  just leave it under your seat. Okay?
170:02:44|T|LMP|Okay.
170:03:02|T|CDR|white ring to table.&quot;  Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna be working on the table here for a second.
170:03:16|T|LMP|Okay. Fine.
170:03:17|T|CDR|I've got to get rid of this LCRU pallet so I can stick the -
170:03:30|C|Eng|Yeah, Charlie.
170:03:34|T|LMP|Is Stu around?
170:03:36|C|Eng|Yeah, he's right here.
170:03:38|T|LMP|If he is, tell him -  If he is, tell him 'Sixty-Four Charlie' just topped the Mount Whitney event.
170:03:50|C|Eng|Okay, we'll do that.
170:03:57|T|CDR|Crypt code on the Moon.
170:03:59|C|Eng|Okay. He evidently knows what you're talking about.
170:04:08|T|CDR|Uh-uh.
170:05:29|T|LMP|
170:05:29|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie, any time you put anything in the spacecraft, would you call it off?
170:05:37|T|LMP|Okay. I'm putting things in the ETB right now.
170:05:45|C|Eng|Okay. Could you call it off as you put it in there? We'll keep track - Or, help you.
170:05:50|T|LMP|Okay. All the film that we brought out, except the mag on the DAC and the two mags on the camera. Magazine F and magazine Echo are still on the cameras. John's seat bag is empty of film.
170:06:17|T|LMP|Oh no.
170:06:21|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
170:06:24|T|CDR|There isn't even a strap to pull it out with.
170:06:28|C|Eng|If you hold it upright and shake it, do you think it will come out the bottom?
170:06:36|T|CDR|Want me to do that?
170:06:37|C|Eng|Yeah, why don't you try that?
170:06:38|T|LMP|Why don't you pull and let me hold the thing.
170:06:49|T|CDR|No.
170:06:52|T|LMP|John, let me suggest something. Let me hold it - the frame - and you pull on it.
170:07:04|T|CDR|Here we go.
170:07:06|T|LMP|Moved, didn't it?
170:07:07|T|CDR|Yeah, but there's no string to hold on to.
170:07:10|T|LMP|How about your pliers?
170:07:12|T|CDR|Hey, there you go.
170:07:14|T|LMP|Okay, can you reach them? You want me to get them for you?
170:07:15|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:07:19|T|LMP|Move your arm up.  Okay. There you go.
170:07:28|T|CDR|Get it so I can get the thing open. So I can get the first frame out, then we can get it.  I don't know, it may gonna be a struggle all the way.
170:07:48|T|LMP|I didn't see it move at all.
170:07:49|T|CDR|It moved - It looked as though it came out some.  Okay.
170:07:57|T|LMP|Is it coming?
170:07:59|T|CDR|Pulling the thing off.
170:08:14|T|LMP|There it comes.
170:08:16|T|CDR|There we go, there we go.
170:08:19|T|CDR|Yep.
170:08:20|T|LMP|I think you got it now, babe.
170:08:20|T|LMP|Woop! It's getting heavy.
170:08:25|C|Eng|Good show. Good work, Charlie.
170:08:27|T|LMP|Can you stick it back in there ?
170:08:28|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:08:30|T|LMP|Hey, that - Thanks for those pliers, boy. We'd have never done it. I could feel that through my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="alsj">gloves</a>. Okay.
170:08:40|T|CDR|Okay. The first panel is black at 180 degrees F.
170:08:44|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
170:08:49|T|CDR|It's on the back, and it was, of course, facing right into the Sun.
170:09:03|T|LMP|Okay. I got the magazine off the DAC, Tony.
170:09:08|C|Eng|Okay.
170:09:10|T|LMP|&quot;ETB; DAC magazine T to DAC.&quot; Okay.  You don't want me to put any magazine T on the DAC, do you?
170:09:19|C|Eng|No. If it's out of battery , there's no point.
170:09:24|T|LMP|Yeah, we're not gonna do that Descartes Olympics thing.
170:09:30|C|Eng|No. Okay. So let's not put anything on the DAC.
170:09:32|T|CDR|Okay, the temp plate on the top one -
170:09:36|T|LMP|Okay. I'm just gonna leave it on the -
170:09:38|T|CDR|The &quot;temp&quot; plate on the top one is black at a 160 degrees F.
170:09:42|C|Eng|Okay.
170:09:44|T|CDR|And the A &quot;temp&quot; plate on the top is black at 120 and gray at 160.
170:09:54|C|Eng|Okay.
170:09:55|T|CDR|So it must have stayed relatively cool.
170:09:57|C|Eng|Good show.
170:10:04|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. That thing was hot, I tell you. When I had the frame, after 5 or however many minutes there, I could start feeling it through my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="alsj">gloves</a>.
170:10:17|C|Eng|Rog. We got that.
170:10:18|T|LMP|John, those pliers are going to hang you up. You want me to unsnap 'em?
170:10:23|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:10:24|T|LMP|Okay. They're unsnapped. No, they aren't, either. You want them unsnapped?
170:10:28|T|CDR|No, just throw it back in there.
170:10:29|T|LMP|Okay, give it here.
170:10:31|T|CDR|Fix the whole works.
170:10:51|T|CDR|Okay. Cosmic ray detector bag -
170:11:01|T|LMP|Dust; motion - Okay. No more -
170:11:10|T|LMP|Okay, Tony; we're not doing any Grand Prix anymore, are we?
170:11:13|C|Eng|Negative.
170:11:18|T|LMP|You're clipping badly, Tony. Say again?
170:11:20|C|Eng|Negative. No Grand Prix.
170:11:32|C|Eng|Okay. The solar wind. Rog.
170:11:35|T|CDR|Charlie, I just retrieved it .
170:11:38|T|LMP|I don't mean the cosmic ray, I mean the SWC.
170:11:59|T|LMP|Oh, just like in training.
170:12:05|T|CDR|Okay. Cosmic ray detector is bagged, and as near as I can tell, there's no thumbprints on it - on any of the plates.
170:12:18|C|Eng|Okay.
170:12:20|T|LMP|This thing's got a mind of - It's wild, Tony!
170:12:27|T|CDR|Look at that, Charlie. Clean across the crater.
170:12:32|T|LMP|Here goes the javelin throw!
170:12:35|C|Eng|Wow!
170:12:36|T|LMP|Won't win any world's record, but -
170:12:38|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. This thing, when it wound up, I tried to - It got away from me, and it tore just a little bit, but I think we'll be able to get it in the bag.  up at the upper part.
170:12:55|T|LMP|Didn't wind up like a window shade.
170:12:59|C|Eng|That's okay; it'll work fine that way. Doesn't make any difference.
170:13:04|T|LMP|Okay; I got it wound up.
170:13:12|C|Eng|And, John, I understand there's a tempa-label on the CRE bag. Did you get that?
170:13:26|T|CDR|No, I'll get it later.
170:13:28|C|Eng|Okay.
170:13:29|T|CDR|In fact, I'll get it right now. Okay. It's all okay.
170:13:40|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
170:13:42|T|CDR|- little.
170:13:53|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie; and remember the drum on the penetrometer.
170:14:02|T|LMP|Yup. Thank you.
170:14:04|C|Eng|Okay.
170:14:20|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I put the big rock bag on the ladder hook.
170:14:25|T|LMP|Okay.  Actually worked, Tony. It came off.
170:14:32|C|Eng|Good show.
170:14:35|T|LMP|Did you get the big rock out of the footpad?
170:14:38|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:14:39|T|LMP|you get old Muley out of there?
170:15:00|T|LMP|I didn't put it there.
170:15:02|T|CDR|That's one that was there from last time.
170:15:03|T|LMP|Is it empty?
170:15:04|T|CDR|Yeah, it's SCB-2. I'll throw that under the LM.
170:15:07|T|LMP|Okay.
170:15:14|T|LMP|This bag is pretty full. We got two full rock bags and one that's partially full, John.
170:15:20|T|CDR|Okay.
170:15:21|T|LMP|We got 4 and 6 are full, and 7 has got two core tubes and a - Excuse me.

170:21:37|C|Eng|Okay. It sounds good. We think so, too.
170:21:57|C|Eng|For a 380-pound guy, that's pretty good.
170:22:01|T|CDR|- they threw that out. Yeah, I jump flat-footed straight in the air, 300 -
170:22:08|T|LMP|About 4 feet.
170:22:08|T|LMP|Wow!
170:22:14|T|CDR|Charlie!
170:22:15|T|LMP|That ain't any fun, is it?
170:22:17|T|CDR|That ain't very smart.
170:22:18|T|LMP|That ain't very smart.  Well, I'm sorry about that.
170:22:23|T|CDR|Right. Now we do have some work to do .
170:22:32|T|LMP|Agh! How about a hand, John? There we go. Okay.
170:22:37|T|CDR|Okay. I want to park the Rover.
170:22:38|T|LMP|Okay. I'm gonna start upstairs then.
170:22:42|T|CDR|Well - No, you're too dirty to go up there.
170:22:44|T|LMP|I'm not going in! I'm just taking some bags up, okay?
170:22:46|T|CDR|Okay.    Okay. Do you want the LCRU to switch 1 when we start out there, right Houston?
170:23:04|C|Eng|Yes, that's affirmative.
170:23:06|T|CDR|Do you read? Over.  Okay. Going to switch 1.
170:23:31|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie.
170:23:55|T|CDR|Houston, the problem, as you must know, with 085 at 0.1 is that such a reading puts us through a crater that's about 18, 20 feet deep, and it's too steep to climb in and out of.
170:24:28|T|LMP|Rats.
170:24:31|C|Eng|How far is it to the other side of it, John?
170:24:39|T|CDR|It's - Oh, it's only a couple of feet. We'll get here at 085 at 100 meters.
170:24:48|C|Eng|Okay. That'll be fine.
170:24:57|T|CDR|Something on here has reset the range.
170:25:30|T|LMP|Okay. One bag is up, Tony.
170:25:32|C|Eng|Okay. Did you see the number on that?  Don't go back to look -
170:25:40|T|LMP|I'm sorry I didn't. 6 or 7. We got 6 and 4 down here.
170:25:46|C|Eng|Okay. It must have been 7.
170:25:51|T|LMP|Thank you .
170:26:14|C|Eng|And, Charlie; understand you got the Muley rock and put it in the big rock bag?
170:26:20|T|LMP|John did. Rog.
170:26:22|C|Eng|Okay.  And, John; once you get parked out there, we're going to need that whole front end brushed off. If you just want to start on the panel and work back, that's probably the best way. We'd like you to use the -
170:26:51|T|CDR|Understand.
170:27:09|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm parked on a slope of about 10 degrees - or 5 or 6 or 7 degrees - toward the lunar module, and it's my guess that this will help your cooling some, because it 's looking towards deep space a little. And I'm about 100 yards directly aft of the lunar module. Is that where you want this contraption to be?
170:27:44|C|Eng|Okay. It's heading 165.
170:27:49|T|LMP|Yep. Heading is 165.
170:27:51|C|Eng|Okay. Fine. And before you turn it off, there, we'd like a complete readout.
170:28:11|T|CDR|Okay. I don't want to do any unnecessary brushing. How about somebody reading the EVA Closeout decal to me. This thing is so dusty, I can't read anything.  Amp-hours -  Well, bearing is 243, which can't be right; distance 11.4; range 0.2. Amp-hours is 28, and 120 on 2; and amps, of course, are off-scale low .  Volts are 65, 65. Forward and rear motor temps are off-scale low. And, of course, battery 1 is off-scale low; and battery 2 is reading 143.
170:29:17|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that; 43.
170:29:21|T|CDR|That do it, Houston, for you?
170:29:22|C|Eng|Right.
170:29:25|T|CDR|Okay, now. How about reading the Closeout decal to me there, because I can't see it for the dust. Even after I brush it, I can't see it.
170:29:33|C|Eng|Okay. The closeout. &quot;Circuit breakers all open except Auxiliary. Bus A and C should be Closed.&quot;
170:29:54|T|LMP|Okay, Tony; I've got two bags up, and I'm gonna have to wait and let John take in the rest, and I'm policing up the area, and it looks like everything is pretty much under the LM.
170:30:08|C|Eng|Okay. And, John, Auxiliary Circuit Breaker Bypass, On.
170:30:16|T|CDR|Okay. Wait a second here.
170:30:17|C|Eng|Okay.
170:30:22|T|CDR|Okay. The Bypass switch is coming On.
170:30:25|C|Eng|Okay. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LCRU.html" target="alsj">LCRU</a> Power, External; and Mode 3, TV Remote.
170:30:37|T|CDR|Okay. Let me line up the high gain.
170:31:01|T|CDR|Take the lens shade off?
170:31:03|C|Eng|Rog. Just take it off and throw it away.
170:31:05|T|CDR|What do you want to do with it?
170:31:33|C|Eng|Okay.
170:31:36|T|LMP|Okay. How you doing, babe?
170:31:38|T|CDR|Trying to line the Earth up.
170:32:05|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie. If you're out of things to do there, why don't you go on out where John is and see if you can find an igneous or a hard breccia to put on top of that LPM. Use his camera to document it.
170:32:18|T|LMP|Okay. I'll do that. I was just standing there. I don't have a camera, though, now, Tony.
170:32:29|C|Eng|Okay -
170:32:29|T|CDR|- , Charlie.
170:32:30|C|Eng|Just use John's.
170:32:33|T|LMP|All right.
170:33:05|C|Eng|Okay, John. Verify that the circuit breakers you still have in on the panel are at Aux and circuit breakers A and Charlie .
170:33:23|T|CDR|Roger. We're staying here.
170:33:30|C|Eng|Okay. And if you have a chance to aim the high gain, we'll get our TV back.
170:33:35|T|CDR|Aux Power is in, Bus A is in, Bus B is in, and the rest of them are pulled.
170:33:44|C|Eng|Okay. We would -
170:33:45|T|CDR|circuit breakers - pull. Okay. Wait a minute.
170:33:46|C|Eng|- like B out, and Charlie in, and Delta out.
170:33:54|T|CDR|That's the way I got it.
170:33:56|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
170:34:03|T|LMP|Where's your camera, John?
170:34:05|T|CDR|Right here, Charlie.
170:34:16|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.   Okay. A hard breccia or an igneous rock.  Here's a TV shade!
170:34:44|T|CDR|Charlie, vector me in again.
170:34:46|T|LMP|I can't do it from here, John. Looks like to me you got to go right. Or down, to you, I guess it is.  Okay. This one looks pretty good right here, John.
170:35:20|T|LMP|Do you want this rock brought back, Tony? That is, for the LPM?
170:35:25|C|Eng|Roger. We'd like you to document it before you touch it, and then when you get the LPM first measurement, we'll put it on the LPM, take a picture of it on the LPM, and then we'll get an LPM measurement of it, and then we'll sack it and bring it back.
170:35:46|T|LMP|Okay. It's a pretty good one, but it's too big to sack, unfortunately
170:35:51|C|Eng|Do you have a smaller one around that we can get in the sack?
170:35:57|T|LMP|Yeah, let me look. That was a good -
170:36:01|C|Eng|And we're getting a picture.
170:36:02|T|CDR|There it is. I tell you, when it gets to be a crescent Earth, that thing is really hard to see.
170:36:11|T|CDR|Okay. I going to tighten down your little screws there.
170:36:21|C|Eng|That would be great.
170:36:27|T|LMP|Okay. I'm going to get a couple of cross-Sun stereos is all. Is that all right?
170:36:32|C|Eng|That's fine. We've got the location on TV. And, John, when you start dusting off the panel, we'd like to -
170:36:39|T|LMP|Oh, yeah.
170:36:46|T|CDR|Okay.  Does that embarrass you?
170:36:48|C|Eng|No.  It's just that you got a thermal leak there.
170:36:54|T|CDR|Oh.
170:36:56|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. It's an igneous rock, not a breccia.
170:37:00|C|Eng|Okay. Great.
170:37:04|T|LMP|And it's got that sugary texture to it.
170:37:06|C|Eng|Okay.
170:37:22|T|CDR|Yes, the batteries need dusting.
170:37:25|T|LMP|John, why don't I do that, and you put the LPM out?
170:37:27|T|CDR|Hey, there you go.
170:37:28|T|LMP|Okay. Here's your rock.
170:37:31|T|CDR|Okay. Why don't you set it on the seat, huh?
170:37:33|T|LMP|Okay.
170:37:36|T|CDR|Camera, too. Charlie, lay the camera up there.
170:37:39|T|LMP|Yeah. Okay, Tony. That's frame count 156 and 157 -
170:37:45|C|Eng|Okay.
170:37:46|T|LMP|155 and 156 for that rock.
170:37:49|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
170:37:53|T|LMP|I'm not sure we got - We got a bag left, John?
170:37:56|T|CDR|Yeah, I put a bag under the seat.
170:37:59|T|LMP|Oh, good.
170:38:02|T|CDR|Here are the power switches coming on, Houston.
170:38:04|C|Eng|Okay.
170:38:22|T|LMP|Gosh. Dumb-dumb.  I dusted the back mirror, and then I dusted the front, and now I got re-dust .
170:38:29|C|Eng|Right. And, Charlie, we'd like you to dust that panel and the top of the console.
170:38:36|T|LMP|All right, sir. Just a moment.
170:38:38|C|Eng|Okay.
170:38:41|T|LMP|What panel?
170:38:43|C|Eng|The control panel on the LRV.
170:38:48|T|LMP|Oh, all right.
170:38:54|T|CDR|Why do you want to do that, Houston?
170:39:00|C|Eng|We want to keep the temperature of the panel down.
170:39:02|T|CDR|In case anybody comes back?
170:39:05|C|Eng|I guess so. Keep it nice for the next guy.
170:39:09|T|CDR|Okay.
170:39:19|T|LMP|Okay. The top of the panel is dusted, Tony.
170:39:28|C|Eng|Okay. Great.
170:39:32|T|LMP|Sometimes I think I'm - .
170:39:35|C|Eng|And we'll need all sides of that console and I guess that panel you just dusted.
170:39:43|T|LMP|All right.  Okay. The top and the driver's side is dusted. The left battery's dusted. I'm going to dust the LCRU.
170:40:12|C|Eng|And, Charlie, after dusting the LCRU there, you'll have to tear off one of those thermal blankets and put it over the control panel on the LCRU.
170:40:25|T|LMP|Okay.
170:40:26|C|Eng|The big one, the 65-percent one.
170:40:31|T|LMP|The which one?
170:40:32|C|Eng|The 65-percent blanket. And, John, we saw you get back and we started your clock.
170:40:39|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you.  Let me show you what to do with that one, Charlie.
170:40:54|T|LMP|Okay.
170:41:07|T|LMP|I think I see how it goes.
170:41:21|T|CDR|You know, we sure hope you guys have enjoyed watching this as much as we've enjoyed doing it. If there's one thing that's a real pleasure; it's this gravity environment.
170:41:31|C|Eng|Okay. And you've got a minute . And we've sure enjoyed watching, I can tell you.
170:41:40|T|LMP|Well, I hope we got all the rocks, Tony, that are here.
170:41:45|T|CDR|We got all the rock types that look different from any other rock type.
170:41:49|T|LMP|John, is that right on the thermal blanket? It covers the thing. That's pretty good.
170:41:56|T|CDR|No, it folds down, and - Let me show you.
170:42:05|T|LMP|Oh, I see.
170:42:07|T|CDR|something it attaches to down there.
170:42:09|T|LMP|Yeah.
170:42:10|T|CDR|Agh.
170:42:11|T|LMP|Oh, you got it.
170:42:12|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:42:18|C|Eng|And, John, do you want to get that ? And don't walk towards the LPM there, Charlie.
170:42:25|T|LMP|Rog.
170:42:38|T|CDR|Okay, I'm going to read the LPM, Houston.
170:42:41|C|Eng|Okay.
170:42:50|T|CDR|Okay.
170:42:51|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. The center mirror on the Rover is a little streaky, but it's -
170:42:57|T|CDR|Charlie, let me read this? X is 322, Y is 530, Z is 510. Can't turn it on but 10 seconds at a clip. X is 322, Y is 531, Z is 507.  X is 321, Y is 531, Z is 510.
170:43:29|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that -
170:43:30|T|CDR|, Houston.
170:43:32|C|Eng|- and when you put the rock on -
170:43:35|T|CDR|Okay. We'll start with the rock.
170:43:35|C|Eng|- we'd like a couple of cross-Suns of it.
170:43:40|T|LMP|Don't forget your camera, John.
170:43:41|T|CDR|Okay.
170:43:42|T|LMP|Here's the rock. I'll get the camera for you. And I guess I'll go on back and take the brush.
170:43:48|T|CDR|Okay.
170:43:50|T|LMP|Okay? I'll bring your camera out.
170:43:57|C|Eng|And leave that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-lensbrush.html" target="alsj">lens brush</a> there for John to dust the lens with.
170:44:07|T|CDR|You mean you didn't dust the lens, Charlie?
170:44:09|T|LMP|No, I forgot it. I'll get it.
170:44:11|T|CDR|Okay. Dust the lens over the mirror. Then you got to redust the mirrors.
170:44:18|T|LMP|Yeah, I know. That's why I'm going to bring it around this way.
170:44:22|C|Eng|Good plan, Charlie.
170:44:28|T|CDR|Better dust the LCRU.
170:44:49|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
170:44:53|T|LMP|- 7 o'clock.
170:44:55|T|CDR|Those mirrors are as clean as we can dust them, Houston. If they don't cool down, then there's a problem with thermal.
170:45:03|C|Eng|Okay.
170:45:07|T|LMP|Going on back, John.
170:45:08|T|CDR|Sir?
170:45:09|T|LMP|I say I'm going back .
170:45:11|T|CDR|Okay.
170:45:12|T|LMP|I promise not to get in until you dust me.
170:45:14|T|CDR|Okay.
170:45:15|T|LMP|Sorry about falling down there, -
170:45:17|T|CDR|Okay.
170:45:19|T|LMP|It's only my fifth time, I think.
170:45:21|T|CDR|Five times in how many hours is not too bad, Charlie.
170:45:23|T|LMP|trying to show off.  Can't get over this big crater, John, behind us.
170:46:09|C|Eng|Okay.
170:46:14|T|LMP|Tony, is your TV camera working?
170:46:16|C|Eng|Yeah, it is. We're driving it around now.
170:46:18|T|LMP|Yeah, I see it moving.
170:46:19|C|Eng|We'll be around to John in a minute.
170:46:21|T|LMP|Okay.
170:46:29|T|CDR|Close the Hand Tool Carrier.
170:46:31|T|LMP|Hey, don't forget that mag on that camera.
170:46:33|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. I'm back at the -
170:46:36|C|Eng|Okay. And I started your clock.
170:46:37|T|CDR|- at the Rover.
170:46:38|C|Eng|Did you get a picture -
170:46:39|T|CDR|You got the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>?
170:46:39|C|Eng|- of it while you were out there?
170:46:40|T|CDR|You got the dustbrush?
170:46:44|T|CDR|Yeah, a stereopair.
170:46:46|C|Eng|Okay. Fine.
170:46:47|T|LMP|Yeah. I got the dustbrush, John.
170:46:49|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay. Go to it, Charlie. You're giving me that minute, aren't you, Houston?
170:47:11|C|Eng|Yeah, I sure am. You've got about 20 seconds.
170:47:21|C|Eng|How's that?
170:47:23|T|CDR|Charlie looking down into a crater that's 10 feet 10 feet -
170:47:32|C|Eng|Okay; Mark, John.
170:47:37|T|CDR|- 10 feet to the rear footpad, and 25 foot deep.  Sir?
170:47:47|C|Eng|Go ahead .
170:47:48|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay, Houston. 317, 525, 5 - 317, 525, 513.  320, 526, 513.  321, 526, 513.
170:48:20|C|Eng|Okay. We copy those.
170:48:21|T|CDR|Get those, Houston?
170:48:25|C|Eng|Okay. If you'll bag that one -
170:48:27|T|CDR|And the Read switch is going off.
170:48:28|C|Eng|We've got it here, and you can go on in.
170:48:30|T|CDR|What do you want -  Okay. What do you want me to do with the LPM, want to get it out of the way so it doesn't flap around and hit the LCRU at lift-off or something?
170:48:45|C|Eng|We're not too worried about it, just leave it there.
170:48:51|T|CDR|All righty.
170:49:03|C|Eng|And, John, when you bag that , we'll need a bag number.
170:49:15|T|CDR|Charlie, this is a pretty good rock.
170:49:16|T|LMP|It is, isn't it?
170:49:18|T|CDR|It's got a spectacular little zap pit in it. It's lined and it's all silvery and glassy. Fred H&ouml;rz will appreciate this rock.
170:49:29|T|LMP|Yeah.
170:49:30|C|Eng|We'll appreciate them all.
170:49:33|T|LMP|You can see those sugary-textured ones.
170:49:37|C|Eng|And we better -
170:49:38|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, bag 331.
170:49:39|C|Eng|- hustle on back in, we're getting up against it. Bag 331.
170:49:44|T|CDR|Oh, okay.
170:49:49|T|LMP|We're getting what, Tony?
170:49:50|C|Eng|We're getting up against the time limit. We'd like you to get on in.
170:49:56|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm standing at the footpad ready -
170:49:57|C|Eng|That's not a PLSS time limit.
170:49:58|T|LMP|- ready to get dusted and get my antenna -
170:50:02|T|CDR|Say again?
170:50:04|C|Eng|That's not a PLSS time limit. That's in time for getting ready for lift-off.
170:50:11|T|LMP|Yeah.
170:50:12|T|CDR|Yeah. Understand.
170:50:21|C|Eng|And, Charlie, I interrupted. What were you saying?
170:50:24|T|LMP|Kind of looks -  Oh, I don't remember.
170:50:35|T|CDR|Boy, Houston, the beauty of this place is absolutely incredible!
170:50:47|C|Eng|We agree. And there's another spectacular view! The pilot who missed the crater.
170:50:57|T|LMP|Watch out. Watch out, John.
170:51:01|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:51:02|T|LMP|To your left is that crater.
170:51:05|T|CDR|That'd be pretty good to miss it on landing and fall in on it before taking off, huh?
170:51:13|T|LMP|Well, the way I've been falling, I probably would. That's why I steered way clear.  Boy, this backpack, once you get it torqued off, you can't stop it.
170:51:26|T|CDR|Not without moving.
170:51:27|T|LMP|That's right. There. Okay. Yeah, I'll put the rock -  you take the camera off, I'll put the rock in this SCB over here.
170:51:37|T|CDR|Okay.
170:51:38|T|LMP|Okay. Did you give them the bag number?
170:51:40|T|CDR|Yeah.  Okay, Houston. I'm up to frame count 168 on magazine E.
170:51:52|C|Eng|Okay.
170:52:08|T|LMP|Okay, John.  ready to be dusted.
170:52:14|T|CDR|Boy, that's the last one. It's not going to come out, because -
170:52:19|T|LMP|Yeah, you're going to have to take it off.
170:52:21|T|CDR|We got to take it off. Just shot 169 of the old Rover sitting there. Boy, that's a good machine.
170:52:30|T|LMP|Yeah, it's an incredibly good machine.
170:52:45|T|CDR|Okay?
170:52:46|T|LMP|Okay, there you go. Hang on to this.
170:52:50|T|CDR|Now, we got some work to do here, boy. You're all dirty.
170:52:54|T|LMP|You ought to see your back. I couldn't have gotten any dirtier than you.  The only other thing we need, John, is the far UV mag.
170:53:08|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:53:11|T|LMP|I think this stuff is just ingrained into the suit right now.
170:53:14|T|CDR|Yeah, I don't think we're going to be able to get it off.
170:53:24|T|LMP|A little bit's coming off your arm when I whack it. There we come.
170:53:30|T|CDR|Well, the message is clear.
170:53:32|T|LMP|What?
170:53:33|T|CDR|Don't lose the fender off the Rover.
170:53:35|T|LMP|Yeah, you ought to see the top of your helmet.  Looks like it's little mud drops.
170:53:47|T|CDR|Get a little farther away, Charlie?
170:53:49|T|LMP|Yeah.  I'll kick off my legs , John.
170:54:19|T|CDR|Okay.
170:54:21|T|LMP|Could you close that pocket so the dirt -
170:54:22|T|CDR|Want to get the pockets off?
170:54:24|T|LMP|Well, I don't think we have time. Let's get - I just want to get the thing closed.
170:54:30|T|CDR|Okay.
170:54:32|T|LMP|There we go. I got it. There, that's great. That's where all that dust came in from yesterday, was - Yours is closed.
170:54:40|T|CDR|Okay.
170:54:42|T|LMP|Okay, let me try you now. Some off your helmet.  Uh-oh, did I turn your comm? No, it's on. Golly, that Rover, really - Okay. Let me get under here. There we go a little bit, it's working.
170:55:14|T|CDR|Boy, I tell you, Houston, if we just had some air up here, we could plow this.
170:55:22|T|LMP|Turn around, John.
170:55:23|T|CDR|Sure is good-looking dirt, I'll tell you that.
170:55:29|C|Eng|Well, maybe some day.
170:55:36|T|LMP|Okay. Spin.
170:55:41|T|CDR|Man, it is brand new.
170:55:45|T|LMP|Yeah, I think I got most of that stuff off that Rover wheel because your  - on my side -
170:55:54|T|CDR|Is the worst?
170:56:10|T|LMP|Is the worst. Yeah. Can you put your arm over your helmet? There we go. Okay.  Let me spend some time here. Okay. That's probably about as good as we're gonna do, John.
170:56:11|T|CDR|Okay.
170:56:12|T|LMP|Okay;  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="alsj">antennas</a>, and I guess I'm ready to climb in.
170:56:17|T|CDR|Well, you know, I don't think we need to worry about the antennas, but let me get yours. Golly! Look at the top of your - Let me worry about that; let me get the top of your PLSS cleaned off.
170:56:26|T|LMP|Okay.
170:56:28|T|CDR|Here, come on by the ladder.
170:56:29|T|LMP|Okay.
170:56:35|T|CDR|-
170:56:44|T|LMP|Is it on the OPS?
170:56:45|T|CDR|All over it.
170:56:46|T|LMP|Oh, yours is dirty, too, I couldn't reach it though; gonna bypass it. It might be a good idea to let me -
170:56:52|T|CDR|Well, we're gonna keep the OPSs, Charlie.
170:56:55|T|LMP|I know it. We better - You better lean over and let me get yours.  That rock bag is filthy.
170:57:07|T|CDR|I heard of dusting off, but I didn't know we were going to have to go from the top down. Stand up, Charlie, and let me get the back of it.
170:57:26|T|LMP|You know that engine bell didn't even blow out that big old rock over there.
170:57:30|T|CDR|I know it.
170:57:32|T|LMP|Well -
170:57:33|T|CDR|There you go.
170:57:36|C|Eng|Okay, fellows. We should be pressurized in about 5 minutes.
170:57:40|T|CDR|There you go.
170:57:41|T|LMP|Oh, that's great. Boy, is that dirty up there. Can you -
170:57:53|T|CDR|Yeah.
170:57:58|T|LMP|My knee on your antenna.
170:58:01|T|CDR|Okay.
170:58:02|T|LMP|Okay, spin around just a little bit. Whoa.
170:58:05|T|CDR|You want me to get down?
170:58:06|T|LMP|No, you're great. Right there's fine.  Okay, that's the best I can do, John.
170:58:18|T|CDR|Well, boy, that's about it, Charlie.
170:58:21|T|LMP|Okay.
170:58:22|T|CDR|That's about the best we can do.
170:58:23|T|LMP|Let me - Bend over and I'll get your antenna.  I'll put my visor down.
170:58:50|T|LMP|About had it and it slipped out. Five-minute operation here .
170:58:57|T|CDR|Man, Houston, this portable life-support system is really a good piece of gear.
170:59:05|C|Eng|Okay.
170:59:07|T|LMP|Okay, it's down now.
170:59:08|T|CDR|Houston, are you reading us? Over.
170:59:11|C|Eng|Yeah, we are. Are you copying us?
170:59:14|T|CDR|Ain't reading us, are they?
170:59:16|T|LMP|Doesn't sound like it, does it?
170:59:17|T|CDR|Houston, are you reading us? Over.
170:59:20|C|Eng|We copy you 5 by. How us?
170:59:23|T|CDR|Go on and get in. Why don't you go ahead and get in?
170:59:24|T|LMP|You want to get that antenna?
170:59:27|T|CDR|Your antenna?
170:59:28|T|LMP|Yeah.
170:59:29|T|CDR|No. We don't need it anymore, do we?
170:59:30|T|LMP|Okay. No.
170:59:31|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay. I don't know what happened to the comm.
170:59:43|C|Eng|Hello, Orion; this is Houston.
170:59:48|T|CDR|Hi there. We lost you for a while.
170:59:50|C|Eng|Yeah, we sure did. We're getting kind of back on the time line, we'd like to hustle you on in there.
170:59:59|T|CDR|Charlie's climbing through the door right now, Houston.
171:00:01|C|Eng|Okay. And you've got the UV to get yet?
171:00:07|T|CDR|That's right.
171:00:08|C|Eng|Okay.
171:00:10|T|LMP|What happened to the comm, Tony?
171:00:12|C|Eng|I think we had a dropout down here.
171:00:16|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, Tony. I'm inside.
171:00:19|C|Eng|Good show.
171:00:24|T|LMP|With two rock bags.
171:00:35|C|Eng|Okay. And we'll skip the track-light test; and just let you get on in.
171:00:43|T|LMP|It works. Ken saw it during the -
171:00:46|T|CDR|Yeah, we've already tested it once.
171:00:48|C|Eng|Okay, fine. Let's not do it now.
171:01:07|T|LMP|I'm sorry, John, but I brought some dirt in with me.
171:01:23|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I'm going to bring up the - Houston, I'm going to reset the far UV camera.
171:01:34|C|Eng|Okay, reset three times.
171:01:38|T|CDR|And remove the mag.
171:01:41|C|Eng|Okay, and camera off.
171:01:42|T|CDR|One, two, three. Okay, then camera's coming off.  And the can is full, cassette is being removed. It's out.
171:02:07|C|Eng|Good show.
171:02:09|T|CDR|And it and bag 6 are gonna go up the ladder this time, I guess.
171:02:20|C|Eng|Okay. And, Charlie, you're going to get a feedwater flag pretty soon. Just leave it. Don't put on the auxiliary.
171:02:32|T|LMP|Okay.  What's our time, Tony?
171:02:37|C|Eng|Okay, you've been out 05:31.

171:02:49|T|LMP|Boy.
171:02:50|C|Eng|We'll be down about 10 minutes when you get in.
171:02:56|T|LMP|Okay. I forgot to wind my watch, so that's why I was asking.
171:03:10|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie, this bag is coming open. Wait a minute.

171:03:30|T|LMP|I got it.
171:03:32|T|CDR|Okay, here's the UV cassette.
171:03:36|T|LMP|I got it. I hope that baby worked.
171:03:42|T|CDR|I'm gonna bring the ETB up now.
171:03:44|T|LMP|Okay, and you got a big rock bag on your left.

171:04:16|T|CDR|That's verified.
171:04:18|C|Eng|Okay, and the UV cassette is in the ETB?
171:04:24|T|CDR|No. The UV cassette is in the spacecraft.
171:04:27|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
171:04:30|T|CDR|I brought it up separately.
171:04:34|C|Eng|Okay. We're all for that.
171:04:41|T|CDR|I'll go down and get the big rock bag now, Charlie.
171:04:43|T|LMP|Okay.  Well, that's the last of the old orange juice junk. Just finished it.
171:05:25|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
171:05:37|T|CDR|Can't make the ETB stay closed.
171:05:42|T|LMP|Huh?
171:05:44|T|CDR|Have to take it up open.
171:05:46|T|LMP|What, the big rock bag?
171:05:47|T|CDR|Yeah.
171:05:48|T|LMP|It won't - There's no - There's some snaps on it, but don't worry about that. We'll get that later if you can bring it up open.
171:05:54|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay. I'm disconnecting the LEC and dropping it under the LM.
171:06:52|T|LMP|Okay, John. After I bring this in, wait 2 seconds and let me get behind the hatch and -  I got it.
171:07:09|T|CDR|Okay.
171:07:10|T|LMP|Man, that's a big rock right there. Thanks, babe.  Okay.

171:09:26|T|LMP|Yeah.
171:09:31|T|CDR|&quot;Probably a good idea.&quot;  Okay, feedwater's off.
171:09:42|T|LMP|Okay. Start with the post-EVA , John. I think -
171:09:47|T|CDR|Okay, Primary Water's off; that's Closed. Front hatch closed and locked.

Let me turn the -  Ooh, that feels good. Turn the &quot;Pump, Off, and the Fan, Off&quot;. Okay, &quot;disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA, connect LM H2O&quot;.
171:18:20|T|CDR|There goes yours. Okay, your water hose -  Here it is. What a ball of spaghetti.
171:18:35|T|LMP|That thing's about 95 feet long, John.

171:19:16|T|CDR|Okay.
171:19:17|T|LMP|Okay. &quot;Disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA.&quot; &quot;Connect - &quot;  &quot;PLSS mode, both, to off -  O&quot;, rather. We open the CB s and connect to LM comm. Okay.
171:19:26|T|CDR|Okay.
171:19:27|T|LMP|Tony, we're going off comm for a second.
171:19:29|C|Eng|Okay.
171:20:36|C|Eng|Okay, and, Charlie, when you get a chance, could you pull that MESA circuit breaker?
171:21:10|T|CDR|VHF A to Receive; B to Off; ICS/PTT.&quot;
171:21:42|C|Eng|And, when you get a chance up there, the MESA circuit breaker, open.
171:22:13|T|LMP|Tony, y'all want high-bit-rate? Over.
171:22:17|C|Eng|Stand by one. Did you catch that about MESA circuit breaker?
171:22:27|T|LMP|It is open.
171:22:28|C|Eng|Okay, good show. No, we can't handle high-bit-rate now.
171:32:50|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Orion. We've performed the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A15-17EMUv2Sec4.2.1.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">OPS checkout</a> and they are both good. John's OPS is reading 6000 ; mine's 6200 . Over.
171:33:03|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that.
171:38:35|T|LMP|What are you doing with such a mess of spaghetti, there?  Yeah, the PLSS. Just for now.
171:38:59|T|LMP|Well, we've got to get these return items out of here. &quot;Stow in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#ISA" target="alsj">ISA</a> big pocket&quot;.  -
171:39:17|T|LMP|There's really not anything in there but the shovel.
171:39:32|T|LMP|Yeah, I don't think it's necessary to put that back in the sack. All they're doing it for is weight. You don't have to - . &quot;Unstow scale, weigh Buddy SLSS/rock bag, and collection bags.&quot; Okay, here we go with the -  First, the big rock - .
171:40:11|T|LMP|65 pounds max, supposed to be.  35 .
171:40:30|T|LMP|John. Yeah, number 7.
171:40:45|T|LMP|We can get one rock in there, I think.
171:40:56|T|LMP|Yeah? One that's been in the shade. Get that one in there, that one will go in, too.
171:41:11|T|LMP|That one will go. Try it now. That's all that's in there?
171:41:32|T|LMP|Baby rocks. Well, let's call it 40, and see what they say. They'll let us go with that, I'll bet you. Buddy SLSS bag is 40 . Bag 7, - . Huh?
171:43:23|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. Over.
171:43:25|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
171:43:30|T|LMP|Okay. We've got some weights for you, if you're ready to copy.
171:43:33|C|Eng|All set.
171:43:37|T|LMP|Okay. The BSLSS rock bag, the big rocks, will weigh 40 pounds; bag 7, SCB number 7, is 33; SCB number 4 is 25; SCB number 6 is 20. I get a total out of that of about 118 . Over.
171:44:01|C|Eng|Okay, we concur.
171:45:06|C|Eng|Okay. We're working those numbers over here.
171:45:20|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we've got a weight-saver for you. The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#ISA" target="alsj">ISA</a> only weighs 10 .
171:45:26|C|Eng|Okay. ISA weighs 10.
171:45:29|T|LMP|Actually, it weighs 8 pounds.
171:45:31|C|Eng|Okay, 8.
171:45:33|T|LMP|Make that 8.
171:49:52|C|Eng|Hey, fellows, you have 245 pounds of rocks.  That's not including the weights of the SRCs.
171:50:05|T|CDR|Okay, has some got to go back?
171:50:09|C|Eng|No, I think we're going to be able to find a way. You got an in-plane launch, so things look pretty good. But we're working it here.</blockquote>
171:50:20|T|Slayton|Probably have to throw that big one away, John.
171:50:22|T|CDR|Okay, we're getting - We're getting to the point where we got to know -   Say again?
171:50:29|T|Slayton|We'll probably have to throw away that big one.
171:50:39|T|CDR|Okay. Well, we don't want to throw away any that don't need to be throwed away. That's for sure.  I tell you, there's a couple more tons up here we missed.
171:51:02|C|Eng|Say again, John.
171:51:07|T|CDR|I say, there's a couple of tons up here that we didn't pick up.
171:56:14|T|CDR|Houston, we're about to the point we're -  the jettison bag.
171:56:19|C|Eng|I'm sorry, Charlie - John, say again?
171:56:25|T|CDR|Roger. We're ready to tie up the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="alsj">jett bag</a>.
171:56:28|C|Eng|Okay. We're still trying to get a decision on these rocks down here, if you could hold on one.
171:56:38|T|CDR|Don't want to miss the launch.  I'm just kidding, Tony. Take as long as you need to, to get it right. I know how that is.
171:57:08|T|LMP|Tony, if it helps you out, this morning we jettisoned the CWG s, the LCGs, all of the sleep restraints, everything like that. That was a pretty big bag.
171:57:20|C|Eng|Okay.
172:05:59|C|Eng|Okay, Orion. We're go with the rocks you've got.
172:06:07|T|CDR|Outstanding. Thank you very much. Okay. We're going to press on with the old integrity check now .
172:06:55|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. We're on VOX. How do you read?

172:08:48|T|LMP|Twist it over.  Unhook it and see if it -  Material caught or something.
172:09:07|T|CDR|Take my hat and blow in it.
172:09:17|T|LMP|Why don't - Let's try it now.  That sounded like it was gonna go.
172:09:19|T|CDR|I'm sure I went last time.
172:09:44|T|CDR|Take your hat off before you -
172:09:46|T|LMP|Yeah.
172:09:48|T|CDR|- I'll -
172:09:50|T|LMP|I'll do it. You're all suited up. Let me -
172:09:54|T|CDR|You'll never get your hat back on.  Push the button.
172:10:04|T|LMP|I'll hold that down.
172:10:57|T|CDR|Okay; Houston.
172:10:58|T|LMP|Give me a towel.

172:30:35|C|Eng|Yeah, we read you fine, Charlie.
172:30:40|T|LMP|Okay. We had one heck of a time getting our helmets off. It turns out that this orange juice is the best cement you've ever seen. It seeped down in between the seals and the helmet and the ring, and we couldn't get the thing unlocked without a great effort, but we managed. We're both out now.
172:31:04|C|Eng|Well, we may have a new market for orange juice - glue.
172:31:09|T|LMP|Yeah, we'll clean them off before we re-dock here.

173:08:30|C|Irw|Okay, Orion; this is Houston.
173:08:36|T|LMP|Go ahead, Jim.
173:08:37|C|Irw|Roger. For your reference, if you can just add 4 hours to all the times listed in your checklist there, you will be very close - within 1 minute - for your timing purposes.
173:08:52|T|CDR|Okay. Just as soon as we get a clock running, we'll be more than happy to do that.
173:08:59|C|Irw|Okay. The only thing we're anxious to have you do now is the LGC/IMU power-up.
173:09:07|T|CDR|That's in work.
173:09:08|C|Irw|Roger.
173:09:13|T|CDR|Okay. You want your E-memory dump?
173:09:16|C|Irw|Stand by.  We don't have data yet; so stand by.
173:09:36|T|CDR|Okay. The computer test is successful. And we're holding for your dump.

173:09:50|T|CDR|Okay.
173:10:42|T|CDR|You must have a big dish of some kind. You're clear as a bell.
173:11:55|T|CDR|Hey, Jim. Don't feel - We don't have any idea what time it is. Be our guest on helping us out with where we should be in the time line.
173:12:07|C|Irw|Okay. We're at about 173:23, and we're ready for your E-memory dump.
173:12:19|T|CDR|on the way.
173:13:32|C|Irw|Okay. If you'll go to Data, we'll send an up-link.
173:13:42|T|LMP|You have it.
173:13:44|C|Irw|Roger.
173:14:45|C|Irw|And, Orion; this is Houston. I have some changes to the range and range rate after insertion whenever y'all want to copy it.
173:15:01|T|CDR|That's for the Timeline Book? Right, Jim?
173:15:06|C|Irw|Yeah, that's the first portion there, you know, after insertion. That little graph or box up on the left-hand corner?
173:15:16|T|CDR|Yeah, know it well.
173:16:05|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, go ahead.
173:16:07|C|Irw|Okay, at insertion. I'll read range and then range rate. Insertion, 171.0, minus 492. At one minute, 166, minus 490; two minutes, 161, minus 486; three minutes, 156, minus 482; four minutes, 152, minus 478; five minutes, 147, minus 472; six minutes, 142, minus 467; seven minutes, 138, minus 461; eight minutes, 133, minus 454; nine minutes, 129, minus 447; ten minutes, 124, minus 439; and at TPI minus 10 minutes, should be 44, and minus 155. Over.
173:17:42|T|LMP|Okay, we copy. Starting at insertion, 171, minus 492; 166, minus 490; 161, minus 486; 156, minus 482; 152, minus 478; 147, minus 472; 142, minus 467; 138, minus 461; 133, minus 454; 129, minus 447; 124, minus 439; TPI minus 10, 44, minus 155.
173:18:15|C|Irw|Good readback, Charlie.
173:20:12|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. The computer is yours.
173:20:24|T|LMP|Okay.
173:20:30|T|CDR|Boy, that's nice. That's the first time in 3 days we've known what time it is. 153:32:24, huh?
173:20:42|C|Irw|Roger. We're glad to see you guys get on time. You've done pretty good without a clock.  Okay, Orion. This is Houston. I have the lift-off time for your P57.
173:21:23|T|CDR|Okay. Just a second, Jim.
173:21:25|C|Irw|Okay.
173:21:37|T|CDR|Okay, go ahead with it.
173:21:38|C|Irw|Okay. Lift-off time, 175:43:35.18. Over.
173:21:52|T|CDR|175:43:35.18.
173:21:56|C|Irw|Good readback.
173:22:29|C|Irw|And, Orion, we're just standing by for your P57.
173:22:38|T|CDR|Okay. Is that a good T-ephem?
173:22:41|C|Irw|Stand by.  Okay. T-ephem looks good.
173:22:51|T|CDR|Okay.
173:28:44|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Casper  is going to try a VHF check here shortly.
173:28:52|T|CDR|Okay.  Okay, we're on VHF A to Receive.
173:29:02|C|Irw|Roger.
173:29:10|T|CDR|Is he on A Simplex, Jim?
173:29:14|C|Irw|Stand by.  Okay, John. The configuration for -
173:30:08|T|CDR|You guys copy those angles?
173:30:12|C|Irw|Stand by. Casper's trying to call you now. And the configuration is on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf7-12_13.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">7-12</a>, on your checklist.  Okay, we copied the angles.
173:30:41|T|CDR|Okay, Casper. This is Orion. How do you read? Over.
173:30:47|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. Casper is reading you.
173:31:04|T|CDR|Okay, I'm not reading him.
173:31:12|C|Irw|Orion, verify that your B Receiver's On.
173:31:26|T|CDR|Okay, Casper. How do you read? Over.
173:31:35|T|LMP|Rog. We read you 5 by, Ken. With a little squeal.
173:31:46|T|CDR|How's things up there?
173:31:52|T|CDR|Good show.
173:36:54|T|CDR|Houston, how do you like those torquing angles?
173:36:59|C|Irw|Stand by.  Okay, we've copied the angles.
173:37:32|T|CDR|Okay, they're parked at 153:49:15.
173:37:37|C|Irw|Roger.  Orion, let's go low-bit-rate.
173:39:48|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Verify rendezvous radar breakers are closed. For the antenna positioning.
173:39:59|T|CDR|Yeah, it's in work.
173:40:00|C|Irw|Roger.  Orion, this is Houston, with a change for your Surface Checklist.
173:40:49|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead, Houston.
173:40:51|C|Irw|Okay, it's on page 8-16. We want you to close System A Main SOV prior to System A Ascent Feed, 2, open. Over.
173:41:18|T|CDR|Okay, understand. Say again what page it's on.
173:41:25|C|Irw|That's 8-16. Just before you open the Ascent Feeds, we want you to close System A Main SOV .
173:41:50|T|CDR|Okay, close System A Shut-Off Valve, just before opening the Ascent Feeds.
173:41:57|C|Irw|Roger.
173:42:08|T|LMP|Jim, can you give us some words about Main - System A?
173:42:13|C|Irw|Stand by, Charlie. We'll get a story for you.
173:42:16|C|Irw|In the meantime, perhaps while you're grabbing a bite to eat, I've got a lot of time line book changes, if you'd like to eat while I read them up to you.
173:42:31|T|LMP|Could you stand by a minute? We've got a couple of more stowage items to do.
173:42:36|C|Irw|Okay, just let me know when you're ready.
173:43:51|C|Irw|And, Orion, I have the ascent pads also, when you all are ready to copy.
173:44:06|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, it'll be - You can hold off for 10 minutes or so. I'm putting the OPSs on the floor now.
173:44:13|C|Irw|Okay.
173:55:15|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, I'm ready for the ascent pads. Over.
173:55:19|C|Irw|175:43:35.18. I'll verify that one. Next line, 5525.2, 0032.0, plus 000.2; plus 37762; minus 76550; plus 58556; plus 57018; plus 0032.0; plus 0397.9; 176:37:52.00; LM weight, 10945; Tig , one rev late, 177:42:06; and the CSM orbit is 65 by 55. Over.
173:56:41|T|LMP|175:43:43.18 ; 5525.2, 0032.0, plus 0000.2; 37762; 36550; 58556; 57018 - and the 053 was a minus 76550. 231, 57018; 0032.0; 0397.9; 176:37:52.00; LM weight, 10945; CSM orbit 65.0, 55.0; one rev late, 177:42:06. Over.
173:57:36|C|Irw|Okay, the seconds on Tig is 35.18 and DEDA 53 is minus 76550. Over.
173:57:50|T|LMP|Yeah, I got that, minus 76550 and Tig is 43:35.18.
173:57:57|C|Irw|Good readback. And now I'm ready for the coelliptic .
173:58:05|T|LMP|Go ahead.
173:58:06|C|Irw|Will you give us high-bit-rate first, Charlie?
173:58:12|T|LMP|You got it.
173:58:14|C|Irw|175:46:09.37; 5523.5. 0039.0, plus 000.2; plus 37762; minus 76550; plus 58519; plus 57018; plus 00390; plus 0404.6; TPI, NA. Over.
173:59:07|T|LMP|Okay, copy. 175:46:09.37; 5523.5, 0039.0, 000.2; 37762; minus 76550; 58519; 57018, 0039.0; 0404.6; TPI and the rest is NA.
173:59:34|C|Irw|176:44:33.91; 178:37 all zeros; 057.1, plus all zeros; 0404.6, 0517.0; plus 057.1, plus all zeros, plus 001.3. Over.
174:00:17|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, I need the Noun 11 CSI Tig seconds and everything after Delta-VY.
174:00:27|C|Irw|Okay, Noun 11 seconds is 33.91. Over.
174:00:35|T|LMP|Rog. And start with Delta-VY and read the rest of the pad.
174:00:40|C|Irw|plus all zeros; 0404.6, 0517.0; plus 057.1, plus all zeros, plus 001.3. Over.
174:01:04|T|LMP|Okay, I got it that time. 176:44:33.91; 178:37:00.00; plus 057.1, plus all balls; plus 0404.6, plus 0517.0; plus 057.1, plus all balls, plus 001.3. Over.
174:01:28|C|Irw|Good readback.
174:01:33|T|LMP|Okay, we're ready for the time line update.
174:01:36|C|Irw|Okay, I'll read it. Most all of these items occur after docking, so if we run into any time problem, why, we'll just break it off and pick it up when y'all come around the corner
174:01:52|T|LMP|Okay. Jim, we got all our stuff stowed. We're sitting here getting a bite to eat. And as we can gather, we're at lift-off minus 1:15 in the checklist.
174:02:03|C|Irw|Okay. We're showing about 1:29 here, so you've got about 15 minutes if you want to spend that time copying these changes.
174:02:14|T|LMP|I'd rather spend it eating. I haven't even started yet. If you can hold off on that.
174:02:18|C|Irw|Okay, why don't y'all get something to eat. And, Charlie, we can read these things to you real-time after docking.
174:02:31|T|LMP|That sounds best. Thank you.
174:02:39|T|CDR|Yeah, Jim, it doesn't look like - You can't quite do all of that stowage as fast as we planned it.  You probably know what I mean.
174:03:01|T|LMP|We look pretty presentable now though, Jim. An hour ago, I wouldn't have given two shakes though.
174:03:10|C|Irw|In other words, you're on time now, and you're all stowed.
174:03:16|T|LMP|Yeah, we're all stowed. We're grabbing a quick bite.
174:04:17|T|LMP|Right, sounds great. Thank you.
174:06:55|T|LMP|Jim, pass on to the backroom that that Muley rock weighs 40 pounds.
174:07:01|C|Irw|Understand, 40 pounds.
174:07:04|T|Slayton|Hate to tell you, but the backroom has all disappeared.
174:07:12|T|CDR|Either that or 140 . It was a big rock.
174:12:37|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. I have a basic plan here for post-docking that y'all can listen to while you're eating.
174:12:49|T|CDR|Okay, Jim. Go ahead.
174:12:51|C|Irw|you will need the LM Timeline Book and LM Contingency Checklist at docking to accomplish deactivation. Over.
174:13:56|T|CDR|Okay, understand.
174:13:58|C|Irw|Okay, and at AOS there , we have about 25 minutes to read you the changes if we don't get them to you while you're on the surface.
174:14:14|T|LMP|Okay.
174:14:44|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, we're starting in on the launch prep .
174:14:48|C|Irw|Roger. Understand launch prep.
174:17:41|C|Irw|And Orion, this is Houston. When you power up <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a>, we have a couple of more quantities that we'll be asking you to read out for verification.
174:17:58|T|LMP|Okay.
174:21:56|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, I've got the AGS up. I'm on page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">8-4</a>.
174:22:04|C|Irw|Okay, we see it.  Before you do the 400 plus 6 at the bottom of the page, we'd like you to read out address 537 and 640.
174:22:24|T|LMP|Okay, 537 is minus 77752.
174:22:29|C|Irw|That's good.
174:22:30|T|LMP|And say again the other one?
174:22:32|C|Irw|640.
174:22:40|T|LMP|640 is plus 00004.
174:22:44|C|Irw|Roger. That's a good entry.
174:23:00|T|CDR|Okay, Houston.  - the temperature is reading 95. Want to go ahead and do the radar test?
174:23:06|C|Irw|Stand by. Roger. Let's go ahead.
174:23:29|T|CDR|Okay, you got 1.4 on the AGC; transmitter power is 3.4, shaft error is 2.1 to 2.65; trunnion error is 2.2 to 2.65.
174:24:49|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston with a late change to your time line at Tig minus 2 .
174:25:00|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
174:25:02|C|Irw|Roger. We want you to eliminate the line there &quot;Audio Mode to Vox.&quot; We want you to stay ICS/PTT for the ascent. Stay in your present comm configuration of Down-Voice Backup.
174:25:21|T|LMP|Okay.
174:29:40|T|CDR|Okay; it passed the gyro test okay.
174:29:48|C|Irw|Say again, John?
174:29:53|T|CDR|Vehicle passed the gyro test. You got a new LM weight for us?
174:30:00|C|Irw|Yeah, I thought I gave you one on the ascent pad.
174:30:01|T|LMP|We have it.  We got it.
174:30:57|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We're standing by for your hot-fire check if you want to move on.
174:31:04|T|CDR|Okay, that's what we're doing.
174:31:11|C|Irw|And we're showing about an hour from lift-off.
174:31:17|T|CDR|Rog.
174:31:59|C|Irw|Charlie, when you get a chance, we need your 554 through 6 readouts .  I see you got them now.
174:32:15|T|LMP|minus 113, minus 064, minus 064. Over.
174:32:40|C|Irw|Copied. The start values are minus 116, plus 052, minus 068; and afterwards, they are minus 113, minus 064, and minus 064?
174:32:56|T|LMP|That affirmative.
174:33:15|C|Irw|Okay, Charlie, will you read out 545 again for us?
174:33:24|T|LMP|Rog. Minus 0 - Okay, wait a minute.  Okay, it's plus 060. Excuse me.
174:33:38|C|Irw|Okay, we have it.
174:33:44|T|LMP|Okay, Verb 11 now?
174:34:30|C|Irw|And, Orion, I have a K factor for you whenever you're ready.
174:34:48|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, ready for the K factor.
174:34:52|C|Irw|Roger. Plus 00170, plus all zeros, plus 00004. Over.
174:35:04|T|LMP|Rog. 170, 00, plus 00004.
174:35:09|C|Irw|Roger.
174:35:10|T|LMP|And do you have an up-link for us before we start in the P57 ?
174:35:15|C|Irw|Stand by.  Okay, if you'll go to Data, we'll send you an up-link.
174:35:39|T|LMP|Okay, you have it.
174:35:40|C|Irw|Roger.
174:37:12|C|Irw|Okay, Orion, we're finished with your computer.
174:37:19|T|LMP|Roger.
174:40:52|C|Irw|Okay, Orion; this is Houston. Hot-fire check looked good down here.
174:40:59|T|CDR|Yeah, looked good up here, too.
174:41:00|C|Irw|Roger.
174:41:03|T|LMP|Yeah, those beauties rocked this whole spacecraft, Jim.
174:41:09|C|Irw|Very good.
174:45:55|T|LMP|Can you see our torquing angles, Jim?
174:45:56|C|Irw|Roger. We have then.
174:46:01|T|LMP|Okay, we're going to torque.
174:46:04|C|Irw|Roger.
174:46:05|T|LMP|Mark at 174:57:52.
174:46:51|T|LMP|Jim, you want us to bring ascent batts on or wait until about 35 minutes ?
174:46:56|C|Irw|Stand by. Okay, you can go ahead and bring them on, Charlie.
174:47:02|T|LMP|Okay.
174:48:02|C|Irw|Okay, Orion, I have an 047, 053 value for you .
174:48:09|T|LMP|Okay, stand by. Go ahead.
174:48:12|C|Irw|minus 76552. Over.
174:48:26|T|LMP|Plus 37762, minus 76552.
174:48:31|C|Irw|Good readback.  And, Orion, this is Houston. As far as we can tell, there'll be no PIPA or gyro updates for you.
174:48:47|T|LMP|Excellent.
174:50:16|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. On that rendezvous radar position, we saw a plus 33 instead of 33300 </a>. Over.
174:51:09|T|LMP|Hey, Jim, I slewed the thing up through the optics all the way so it's looking at me. Is that all right?
174:51:20|C|Irw|Okay, it's fine, Charlie. Thank you.
174:51:55|T|LMP|Jim, we loaded your LM ascent weight , but I think the DAP 's limited to 10900 because it comes back up 10900 every time.
174:52:07|C|Irw|Roger.
174:54:07|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. For your information, your total EVA time was 20 hours 14 minutes and 55 seconds. Over.
174:54:20|T|CDR|Gee whiz. That's not bad for a three-rev slip, huh?
174:54:32|C|Irw|Very good, John.
174:55:22|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. 10900 is the max that you can load into the DAP.
174:55:28|T|CDR|Roger.
174:55:55|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, we selected Suit Fan 1 .
174:56:02|C|Irw|Thank you.
174:57:31|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, we're on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-12_13.jpg" title="image" target="alsj">8-12</a> waiting to don our helmets and gloves in about 20 minutes.
174:57:38|C|Irw|Roger. We're following you.
174:58:24|C|Irw|Roger. You look great on consumables. Actually, you have about 18 hours left on your electrical and about 10 more pounds of water. Over.  Would you like to do a fourth EVA?
174:58:38|T|LMP|Roger. Thank you.  If you'd let me sleep, I wouldn't mind.
174:58:38|T|LMP|Houston, our <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="alsj">AGS</a> lunar align appears to be about a quarter or a half degree off the PGNS.
174:59:42|C|Irw|Roger; we copy.  What axis is that, Charlie?
174:59:53|T|LMP|It's in pitch. I'm reading about - in AGS - almost two degrees . When I switched to PGNS, it slipped down about one . Take that back; it's only about a quarter degree, Jim; between about 1-3/4 and 1-1/2.
175:00:19|C|Irw|Okay, it's normal, Charlie. And it'll be in agreement at lift-off.
175:00:26|T|LMP|Thank you. Oh, that's right. I forgot about that.
175:01:11|C|Irw|Casper, this is Houston. How do you read?
175:01:16|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
175:01:17|C|Irw|Okay, the LM is right on the time line; in fact, quite a bit ahead. You can terminate your cabin buildup at the present time.
175:01:29|T|CMP|Okay. I've already done that.
175:02:08|T|LMP|Jim, - 500 feet to go on terminating the ascent feed. Do you want that just done nominally?
175:02:22|C|Irw|Yes, it's nominal except for that change we read up to you about closing System A Main SOV before you open the Ascent Feeds.
175:02:34|T|LMP|Okay, fine. Thank you.
175:03:38|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. You can expect a roll moment offset due to the CG change and the loss of RCS System A. And then at 500 feet to go, when you open the Main Shut-Off valve, you can expect an RCS warning at that time; otherwise, it'll be nominal procedures during ascent.
175:04:05|T|CDR|Orion. Roger.
175:04:15|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, we got an RCS caution light and RCS A Reg light on right now.
175:04:21|C|Irw|Roger.
175:04:27|T|LMP|Our quantity in System A reads zero.
175:04:31|C|Irw|Okay, it shouldn't read that.
175:04:39|T|LMP|That's what we figured. Thank you.
175:05:29|C|Irw|Orion, let's go Biomed, Left.
175:05:42|T|LMP|Rog. You have it.
175:09:45|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. We're suited. We're going to get on the Ascent O2 H2O.
175:09:51|C|Irw|Roger.   Casper, we want you to go Wide Beamwidth.
