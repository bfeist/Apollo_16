<b>140:17:43</b> Duke: Houston, 16.<p>

<b>140:17:46</b> England: Go ahead, Charlie.<p>

<b>140:17:50</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, we're going to pick up the ETB (tasks), and try to get a handle on going through this procedure.  We're on (Surface Checklist page) 3-7 and the eat period.  We're going to pick up on 3-7.  Do you want us to top off the PLSS (with) O2?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Because of the six-hour landing delay, John and Charlie had a rest period before doing the first EVA.  The handwritten notes on Page 3-7 - which are in Charlie's hand - represent procedure changes made prior to that first rest period.  At the bottom of the left-hand column, they had deleted the oxygen top-off after the first rest period because, of course, the PLSSs had not yet been used and still had their pre-flight charges.]</i></blockquote>

<b>140:18:21</b> England: Stand by one.  (Pause)<p>

<b>140:18:30</b> Duke: (Very Faint) And how do we look right now on your timeline (garbled)?<p>

<b>140:18:42</b> England: Okay, go ahead on 3-7 there and top off the PLSS O2, and say that last comment again.<p>

<b>140:18:53</b> Duke: Okay, how are we on the timeline?  We're just about through eating.<p>

<b>140:19:02</b> England: Okay, stand by one.<p>

<b>140:19:03</b> Young: It's a one-minute (oxygen) top off, is it not? 
(Long Pause)<p>

<b>140:19:30</b> England: Okay, Charlie, you're in good shape.  You look like you're about on it.

<blockquote><i>[They had planned to finish the eat period 70 minutes after wake-up.  John's first call of the morning was at 
<a href="a16.eva2wake.html#1390743" target="new">139:07:43</a> and, consequently, they are virtually on schedule.]<p>

( <a href="a16a1402012.mp3" target="new">4 min 53 sec</a> )<br>
There is no comm during the first 53 seconds of this clip.<p>

<b>140:21:06</b> Young: Charlie will be off comm for a while.<p>

<b>140:21:09</b> England: Okay, fine.  And, John, if you have a minute there, you might consider attaching a lanyard to your (Red) Apple on the purge key and attaching the lanyard to one of the fittings on the front of the suit so that if that key comes out, you won't have to go looking for it.  (Pause)  But that's a crew preference; whatever you think's necessary.

<blockquote><i>[Three times during EVA-1, the locking pin on John's purge valve pulled out when he climbed out of the Rover and caught the pin, probably on his seat belt.  The Red Apple is simply a red ball attached to the pin by a cord so that the pin is easy to pull in an emergency.  On all three occasions, they found the pin - primarily because the Red Apple was easy to spot on the gray lunar surface - and Charlie re-installed it.  See
the discussion following <a href="a16.debrief1.html#1284606"
target="new">128:46:06</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>140:21:34</b> Young: Okay.  (To Charlie) Attach a lanyard so the purge key doesn't get away from us.<p>

<b>140:21:45</b> Duke: Huh?<p>

<b>140:21:46</b> Young: Attach a lanyard so the purge key doesn't get away from us.  (Garbled)

<blockquote><i>[Although the discussion between John and Charlie is difficult to make out, it is clear they don't think much of the
idea.  Based on the conversation Tony had with them during the EVA-1 debreifing and his emphasis, here, that they should do 'whatever you think's necessary, he doesn't think much of the idea, either.]</i></blockquote>

<b>140:21:54</b> England: We just aim to please, John.<p>

<b>140:21:59</b> Young: Say again.<p>

<b>140:22:01</b> England: We just aim to please, John.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break.  During the next several minutes, we hear fragments of unintentional transmissions from John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>140:23:23</b> Young: No, we're not supposed to bring it back!  (Brief Pause) Huh?  (Unintelligible)

(The clip starts with 50 seconds of static.  Charlie can be heard faintly, but indistinctly, throughout the following.)<p>

<b>140:26:22</b> Young: I don't know, Charlie.  I can't remember where it comes in the Flight Plan.  I think it's right at 130 hours.  (Pause)  (Garbled)  Yeah.  (Pause)  No, what?  (Garbled) what?  (Pause)<p>

<b>140:27:16</b> Young: Look at that!  If anybody ever said, &quot;you'll be sitting in a spacecraft naked with a 134-pound backpack on your knees charging it&quot;, I'd have said &quot;Aw, get serious&quot;.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>140:27:47</b> Young: It all depends on if you have your mags changed right, Charlie.  You've gotta sort of sit up above the ground.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[&quot;Mags&quot; is probably a reference to the ETB stowage on Surface 3-7.  In his second statement, John may be referring to the considerable amount of dust on the LM floor.  See the discussion following <a href="a16.eva1post.html#1263737"

</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1402820">140:28:20</a></b> Young: Yeah.  (Long Pause)  (Garbled).  (Long Pause)  I'm going to leave my protective cover on my gloves this time, in case Houston gets some wild ideas (garbled)  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Here, John is referring to the fingerless cover gloves - much like a golf glove - they wore over their <a href="A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new">EVA gloves</a> to protect them from abrasion during the ALSEP deployment.  They had planned to  discard the cover gloves after the first EVA because they add bulk to the hands and reduce finger dexterity.  John is concerned about working on the cosmic ray experiment and/or the heat flow connector without the added protection the cover gloves provide.]</i></blockquote>

<b>140:29:33</b> Young: Is that yours?  Is this yours right here?  (Pause)  (Garbled)  (Long Pause)  (Garbled) one more time.  Make sure.  (Pause)  Really need those things (possibly the cover gloves).  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>140:40:30</b> Mitchell: Roger, Orion.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]<p>

[I am not absolutely certain that John said &quot;LCG&quot; in his
last transmission.  Charlie will report that they are <a href="../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new">donning</a> their suits in just a couple of minutes and it is possible that John is checking his over before donning it.]<p>

[Tony could be taking a toilet break or, more likely, getting the final word on any last minute changes to the checklists or plans for the upcoming EVA.  He returns as CapCom at 140:43:56.] </i></blockquote>

<b>140:42:32</b> Young: Houston, Orion.<p>

<b>140:42:34</b> Peterson: Go ahead, Orion.<p>

<b>140:42:40</b> Duke: Right.  Do we have any updates to the EVA-2
checklist?<p>

<b>140:42:49</b> Peterson: Orion, you're very garbled there.  We don't have the updates yet, I guess.<p>

<b>140:43:01</b> Duke: Okay; be advised that we're starting to put on our suits right now (as per Surface 3-8).  Over.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break.  During this comm break, there is a receiving-site handover from Honeysuckle to <a href="../MDSCC.html" target="new">Madrid</a>.  At Madrid, only the 85-foot dish is operational.  The comm during the upcoming EVA will not be quite as good as was possible during the first EVA when the 210-foot dish at Goldstone was in use.

<b>141:22:22</b> England: That's okay.  You've got a good long day today.<p>

<b>141:22:30</b> Duke: Where does this 2 hours come in, Tony?  Is that supposed to be at the end?<p>

<b>141:22:34</b> England: Rog.  That'll be after the EVA.<p>

<b>141:22:42</b> Duke: Okay, so we could eat into that and not affect our sleep period.  Is that right?  (No answer)

<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break.  Charlie's question about the &quot;2 hours&quot; is a reference to a discussion they had with Tony before the rest period at  <a href="a16.debrief1.html#1281833" target="new">128:18:33</a>.  At that time, Tony told them that the EVA-2 day - from wake-up to &quot;good night&quot; - would be longer than planned by one two-hour Command Module orbit.]<p>

<b>141:37:12</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  (Making the report called out on Surface 4-1)  Charlie's <a href="../ApolloPRD.jpg" title="image" target="new">PRD</a> is 21118.<p>

<b>141:37:18</b> England: Okay, 21118.<p>

<b>141:37:25</b> Young: Mine is 22054...(correcting himself, 220)56.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>141:37:48</b> Young: Houston, do you want us to go to Normal Voice like we've got in the checklist (at the bottom of the right-hand column on page 3-8)?<p>

<b>141:40:04</b> Young: Go ahead.  Over.<p>

<b>141:40:06</b> England: Okay, I got this result on the quick look on the X-ray (fluorescence experiment in the CSM SIM Bay).  I just thought I'd pass it up to you.  The Descartes area is higher in aluminum/silicon (ratio) than mare, but it's not as high as the highlands east of Smythii.<p>

<b>141:40:26</b> Young: Well, we can't land there.<p>

<b>141:40:29</b> England: You're right.<p>

<b>141:40:30</b> Young: (Laughing)  Okay, thank you.  What you're saying is the back side is where the action is?  (Pause)  Hang in there, Tony.  We'll give you a little action today.<p>

<b>141:40:44</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Long Comm Break]<p>

[The x-ray fluorescence experiment uses the intensity and energy distribution of secondary x-rays emitted by the lunar surface as a result of illumination by solar x-rays.  The instrument produces maps of the abundance ratios of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon.]<p>

[Journal Contributor David Harland notes &quot;As can be seen in <a href="a16psr-t19-1.jpg" title="table" target="new">table 19-1</a> in the Apollo 16 <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the highlands are generally rich in aluminum while the mare are rich in magnesium.  This is the lunar equivalent of the terrestrial distinction between the continental crust and the ocean floor.  The continental crust can be thought of as a silicon-aluminum rich scum floating on silicon-magnesium rich silicate mantle.&quot;]<p>

[Mare Smythii is on the eastern limb of the Moon.  In Table 19-1 in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the Al/Si  and Mg/Si ratios for the East Smythii highlands are 0.61 and 0.20, respectively, while the values for Mare Foecunditatis are 0.41 and 0.26.]<p>

[John's comment about not being able to land in the East Smythii highlands is a reference to the fact that a crew who wanted to land there would have to do so without the benefit of communications and guidance from Earth unless a comm relay satellite was put in lunar orbit in conjunction with the mission.  See the discussion in the Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal about a proposed landing on the lunar Farside.]</i></blockquote>

<b>141:46:19</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  We're down to PLSS donning (on Surface 4-2).<p>

<b>141:46:26</b> England: Okay; and you're right back on the timeline.<p>

[Jones - &quot;Can you describe for me how you get the PLSSs on or off?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;If I remember what we did, John would hold mine and I'd turn backwards and I could reach back and get the straps and pull them over and hook the two up here, at the sternum, on that little hook that we had up there.  And then I'd take the waist strap and hook it up.  And then, I'd hold John's - I've forgotten who went first - and, in one-sixth gravity, it was real easy to hold them up there.  To get 'em off, first we unbuckled the waist strap.  If I remember, just unbuckle one of the upper straps and then undid the other one and just let it slide off your back.  Then, you know, you could hold it with one strap, easy, and bring it around.  I mean, doing that in 1 g in training was awful.  We struggled and puffed and grunted and cussed; but, up there, it didn't turn out to be any problem.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;How did the <a href="../alsj-RCU.html" target="new">RCU</a> hook on?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;If I remember, it was a clamp and you just pushed it
down...It was a spring-loaded clamp, if you will, that fit next to the body of the RCU and you just pushed it over the hook and it forced the clamp open and, when it got over center, then it clicked back again.  And that held it.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Were there any particular problems because of the lack of room in there?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh well, yeah.  It was awful.  We had rock boxes out and we had ETBs and we had helmet bags and we had gloves everywhere.  You know, it just got real crowded in there.  And oxygen hoses going everywhere.  Two sets.  If you didn't really watch it, you could lose things,
easy.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Kind of like trying to get dressed in a coat
closet.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Right.&quot;]<p>

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;Tony must have had to go make a pit stop.&quot;]<p>

[England, from a 1997 e-mail message - &quot;It seems unlikely that
this was a pit stop so early in the shift.  It may have been a visit to the science room to get something clarified or to suggest some options that they might want to consider.  Generally, it wasn't a good idea to ask hypothetical questions on the loop.  You tended to get hysterical responses and start 'what-if' examinations that were premature.   I may have been concerned that my idea was dumb and preferred to find out about it quietly.&quot;]<p>

[I asked Tony if it was normal to have someone sitting with him at the CapCom console, because during many of the missions it is clear from the dialog at various points that the backup Commander or someone else was sitting with the CapCom.]<p>

[England, from a 1997 e-mail message - &quot;As you know there were CSM and LM CapComs (starting with Apollo 14) when the vehicles were separate.  While there were two seats at each station, I remember only one person at each position most of the time.  I am sure that there were pit stops, but there weren't many - and, frankly, I can't remember how we did them.  Generally, I would not have hesitated to let the Flight Director handle comm during EVA prep or post if there were no systems issues being worked.  There would be many people in the MOCR who understood what was going on.  During the EVA, I would have been very reluctant to leave for any reason.  It is possible that this was a precautionary pit stop to lessen the likelihood of having to leave during the EVA.  I am sure that I drank fluids sparingly to reduce the risk.&quot;]<p>

[My thanks to Journal Contributor Cathy James who suggested that I ask Tony about this procedural issue.]<p>

Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso.  In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. <a href="../A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif" title="image" target="new">Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.]</i></blockquote>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The first thing that
happened to us that really slowed us down on EVA-1 was that Charlie's tool harness fell off, and we both had PLSSs on.  It was really tough to get the tool harness up off the floor, or off the side and underneath Charlie and put (it) back on with both PLSSs on.  We should be able to belt that tool harness on so it wouldn't fall off until such time as somebody makes a positive motion to get it off.  That's really a drag, that tool harness.  Not only could we never keep it from falling off, but we could never keep it on once we got it put on.  We could never keep it on in the vehicle; we always had to tighten it down.  We tightened it down repeatedly inside the vehicle.  Once we got outside the vehicle, we'd have to tighten it down for the last time.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:23:43</b> Young: Go ahead.  Over.<p>

<b>142:23:45</b> England: Okay.  We understand you put your purge valve in so that the apple's outbound.  Are you pretty confident you can operate it out there?<p>

pull, you're pulling 180 (degrees) against the direction you're supposed to go.&quot;]<p>

<b>142:25:29</b> Duke: I'm against the roof.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[<a href="../LMHandbkf1-6.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 1-6 from the LM Operations Handbook</a> shows various cross-sections of the LM cabin.  The inner diameter of the cabin is 92 inches or 2.34 meters.  Directly in front of the hatch, the distance from the floor to the roof is about 2.03 meters and, where Charlie is standing, there is even less headroom.  The astronauts in the figure are each 6 feet 0 inches or 1.83 meters tall.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Could you have stood on the <a href="../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new">midstep</a>?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  I don't know anybody short enough to do that.  You couldn't stand up straight in the normal position, where you stood when you were flying the machine.  Well, you could without the OPS and the PLSS on; but when you put the PLSS on and the OPS, (gesturing) it stuck up here.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Three or four inches above your head.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Or so.  I don't remember; but it was high.  So you had
to move inboard and it put you almost shoulder to shoulder.  When he said 'stand up', you know, I was bumping the top already with the
OPS.&quot;]<p>

[Note added in August 2006:  I asked Charlie about standing on the midstep because I didn't properly understand what the <a href="../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new">midstep</a> was.  I had thought that the flooring on which the astronauts stood was at the same level throughout the cabin and that the midstep was a small step of a few inches on the front of the ascent engine cover.  I didn't understand that there was an eighteen-inch rise from the floor at the front of the cabin up to decking that surrounds the ascent engine cover and extends to the back of the cabin.  The 'midstep' is that eighteen-inch rise.  Even at the centerline of the cabin where the ceiling is about 203 cm above the floor in the front of the cabin, the 18-inch (46 cm) midstep reduces the standing room to 157 cm (5 feet 2 inches).  As Charlie says, none of the astronauts is short enough to be able to stand upright on the midstep, even in street clothes.]</i></blockquote>

We had some wet wipes and we wiped out the connectors and all the seals and the neckring and wiped out the ring around the helmet and the gloves.

<b>142:41:24</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>142:41:25</b> Young: Mark.  (Pause)<p>

<b>142:41:40</b> Young: There it is.  Man!<p> 

<b>142:41:42</b> Duke: Now, go out, dust and
everything.<p>

<b>142:41:46</b> Young: I'll tell you why you can't open it is on account of there's air behind it.<p>

<b><a name="1424149">142:41:49</a></b> Duke: You can tell that.  Look at the particles flying out of here.<p>

<b>142:41:54</b> England: Maybe it'll clean some of that dirt out.<p>

<b>142:41:56</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>142:41:56</b> Duke: You got it?  (Responding to Tony)  It does a pretty good job at that.  (To John)  Hey, John, you're gonna have to turn around and get over next to your circuit breaker panel for me to get any (PLSS sublimator feed) water on or anything.<p>

<b>142:42:12</b> Young: Okay.  Which way?<p>

<b>142:42:16</b> Duke: Turn to your right.  (Pause)<p>

<b>142:42:25</b> Young: Can you get it?<p>

<b>142:42:26</b> Duke: Well, I can;  my darn...(Pause)  Both hands are
all...<p>

<b>142:42:34</b> Young: Okay, let me get yours.<p>

<b>142:42:36</b> Duke: Can you reach it?<p>

<b>142:42:39</b> Young: Watch it that that hatch don't fall shut.  Can you turn around?<p>

<b>142:42:43</b> Duke: That's where I'm gonna head.  Wait a minute.  Okay, there we go.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is trying to turn enough toward the rear of the cabin so John can reach the feedwater switch on the bottom right front corner of Charlie's PLSS.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;We were almost face-to-face most of this time, 'cause we were helping one another with the connectors and gloves and stuff.  The only time you had to turn around is when...When I was facing John, of course, my circuit breaker panel was behind me and the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a> controls - which faced forward - it was right over here to the right rear; and so you had to turn around.  If you didn't watch it you'd keep wrapping yourself up in the hoses.  I had a lot of hoses over on my side and it was crowded.  But, in this case, I think I'm just turning towards the aft so John can get my water on.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:42:55</b> Young: Can you raise up?<p>

<b>142:42:56</b> Duke: Not much more;  I'm hitting the ceiling.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>142:43:18</b> Young: There you are.<p>

<b>142:43:19</b> Duke: Okay.  Water's On.<p>

<b>142:43:21</b> Young: Water is On!<p>

<b>142:43:22</b> Duke: Okay.  Turn back around, I think.  I hope.  Okay, let me have the hatch.<p>

<b>142:43:30</b> Young: Okay.  Going to hand me the jettison thing
and...<p>

<b>142:43:34</b> Duke: Yeah, when you get out on the porch, I'll hand you everything.  Okay?<p>

<b>142:43:37</b> Young: All right.  (Pause)  Okay, (garbled).  (Long Pause)

Okay, I don't have any flags.  That thing (meaning the PLSS sublimator)
must be working like a champ.<p>

<b>142:44:03</b> Duke: I've still got a water flag.  I can see yours is
sublimating.  You can really see it.  Or you can see some ice building up
back there anyway.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The sublimator plates are positioned horizontally at the
top of the PLSS, just below the OPS.  There is an opening in the PLSS
thermal cover just behind the astronaut's neck where the water vapor given off by the sublimator escapes to the lunar vacuum.]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:44:27</b> Duke: I'm getting good cooling.  I can feel it.<p>

<b>142:44:29</b> Young: Yeah, so do I.<p>

<b>142:44:31</b> Duke: Okay, let's go.<p>

<b>142:44:32</b> Young: Okay.<p>
