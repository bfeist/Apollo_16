<blockquote><i>[Charlie's &quot;four-oh&quot; is the indicated 4.0 km range to the LM and &quot;five-two&quot; is the 5.2 km distance they drove to reach Station 4.

<b>145:04:54</b> Duke: (To Houston)  Okay, what should our bearing and range be back to the LM, Tony, when we hit that crater?<p>

<b>145:05:03</b> England: Okay, it'll be 3...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>145:05:05</b> Duke: The one we came...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>145:05:07</b> England: Right; it'll be 354 at 3.4.<p>

<b><a name="1450516">145:05:16</a></b> Duke: Okay.  We're headed 354 and going...That thing (meaning the LRV Nav system) is taking us straight for the LM, John. (Pause)  Downslope is easy!

<b>145:05:25</b> Young: As long as the brakes hold out...<p>

<b>145:05:26</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>145:05:27</b> Young: ...it's going to be easy, Charlie.<p>

<b>145:05:28</b> Duke: Have you got the brakes on?<p>

<b>145:05:29</b> Young: Partially.<p>

<b>145:05:31</b> Duke: Isn't that something?<p>

<b>145:05:32</b> Young: Have to.<p>

<b>145:05:33</b> Duke: Yeah.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Travel to Station 5 was downhill all the way with the brake on.  Driving downhill, I did it with idle power and sometimes put on the brakes.  That's all we had to use.  I wasn't going too fast, maybe 4 or 5 kilometers (per hour).  On a straight stretch (meaning 'level'), (we) might get up to 10.  But coming up to a ridge, I'd slow back down 'cause I had no idea what kind of slope was on the other side of that ridge.  You sure can tell that, if you let that rascal loose, she'd go down that hill in a big hurry.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;When you got the Rover up to about 10 clicks going down a hill, it's just like riding a sled on ice.  No matter which way you turn the wheel, the thing's going straight.  I mean, it'd be sideways, but still going in a straight line downhill.  Lot of mass there.&quot;]<p>

<b>145:05:52</b> Young: Okay.  What was the heading and distance to that...<p>

<b>145:05:54</b> Duke: 354 for 3.4.  (Pause)  You know, it was really not apparent we were climbing this steep a slope.<p>

<b>145:06:14</b> Young: 354 for 0.4?<p>

<b>145:06:33</b> Duke: Okay, we've got a 354 bearing back to the LM right now, so we'll just keep on that.<p>

<b>145:06:38</b> England: Okay.  Sounds good.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>145:06:58</b> Duke: Man, John.  You're doing a great job!  Okay, Tony, coming back downslope 354 at 3.8 is about the same stuff.<p>

<b>145:07:13</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1450717">145:07:17</a></b> Duke: Okay.  We're about to cross our tracks.  (Long Pause)

<b>145:07:39</b> Young: Charlie, you said you were going to see some other tracks on the Moon.<p>

<b>145:07:43</b> Duke: Yeah.

<b>145:08:07</b> Duke: Oh, this machine is super.<p>

<b>145:08:08</b> Duke: Yeah.  (Pause)<p>

<b>145:08:13</b> England: Probably a good idea you couldn't see how steep it was going up.<p>

<b>145:08:18</b> Young: Darn right it was.  (Pause)  Okay.  I've got the power off, and we're making 10 kilometers an hour.  Just falling down our own tracks.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As can be determined from <a href="a16ppD4f23.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 23</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of <a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">USGS Professional Paper 1048</a>, John and Charlie are not going straight downhill but, even so, they drop in elevation about 100 meters over a distance of 600 meters.  This corresponds to an average descent slope of 9.5 degrees.  Parts of the traverse are, of course, steeper than this average.  In comparison, the average downhill slope of Stone Mountain in this area is 12.3 degrees.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1450841">145:08:41</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  I'm keeping my eye out for a blocky rim one.  (Pause)<p>

<b>145:08:50</b> Young: Uh-oh.  (Pause)<p>

<b>145:08:59</b> Duke: Almost spun out.<p>

<b>145:09:03</b> Young: How about this one right here, Charlie?<p>

<b>145:09:04</b> Duke: Yep, that's it, John.  That's a good one.<p>

<b>145:09:13</b> Duke: Okay.  It's Stop 5.  We're supposed to park at...<p>

<b>145:09:18</b> Duke: (Reading <a href="a16eva2LMP-10.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-10</a>) 180.  (Hearing Tony)  Say again, Tony.<p>

<b>145:09:23</b> England: Roger.  I was just saying 180. <p>

<b>145:09:38</b> Young: It doesn't look like one to me either.  Well...<p>

<b>145:09:41</b> Duke: It might be a primary impact, but I think those blocks - the rocks there - are from South Ray.  I think we ought to get a rake sample here.<p>

<b>145:09:50</b> England: How big is that crater?<p>

<b>145:09:55</b> Duke: About 15 meters across.<p>

<b>145:09:58</b> England: Okay.  Understand 15 meters.<p>

<b>145:10:03</b> Duke: That's affirm.<p>

<b>145:10:05</b> Young: Okay.  Well, we're parked right on the rim of it.  We'll let you see.<p>

<b>145:10:11</b> Duke: The biggest blocks we see, Tony, are about 50 centimeters, or bigger.  And they're in the bottom and all over the crater (with) no preferred orientation.  Okay.  We're parked at (heading) 174, (bearing to the LM) 353, (distance driven) 5.9, (range to the LM) 3.5, 100, 100...Okay.  Excuse me, John.  65, 65, 100...(correcting himself)  90, 105; off-scale low, and off-scale low.  (Pause)  Wow!<p>

<b>145:10:58</b> Young: In a hole?<p>

<b>145:11:01</b> Duke: Well, it's downslope for me over here.<p>

<b>145:11:03</b> Young: It is?<p>

<b><a name="1451104">145:11:04</a></b> Duke: Yeah.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The bearing to the LM of 353 and the range of 3.5 puts them near <a href="a16.lsp269.jpg" title="image" target="new">BH.7/82.7</a>.  As indicated above, I believe they are 500 meters north of Station 4 and near <a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">BJ.4/82.3</a>.  The difference is about 160 meters.  Figure 1 in the <a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">USGS Professional Paper</a> shows a Station 5 location about 750 meters north of Station 4 and I believe that this is an error.  My main reason for this conclusion is the simple fact that the range to the LM indicated by the LRV Nav System has only decreased by 0.5 km and, although there are clearly errors in the bearing and range, there are no indications of changes this large over so short a distance during any of the Rover missions.  If my conjecture is correct, then the Station 5 crater is more likely to be the one at the bottom of Figure 13 in the Professional Paper, the crater which is bisected by the bottom of the image about 30 meters left of center.  Readers should note that I have assumed that Station 4 is, indeed, about 80 meters west of the center of Cinco A.  <a href="a16ppD4f23.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 23</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of the USGS Apollo 16 Professional Paper places Station 5 about 580 meters north of Station 4.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1451116">145:11:16</a></b> Young: Me too, Charlie.  Fact is, let's bring the Rover back up here.<p>

<b>145:11:23</b> Duke: Well, I'm out.  I'm not getting out again, and getting back in.<p>

<b>145:11:26</b> Young: No, I don't mean that.  I mean let's bring the Rover back up here.<p>

<b>145:11:29</b> Duke: Oh, you want to pick it up, huh?<p>

<b>145:11:30</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>145:11:31</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>145:11:36</b> Young: Okay, now.  We've got to swing it around.  (Pause)  There we go.<p>

<b>145:11:50</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>145:11:51</b> Young: That's more like it.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As indicated above John parked on a heading of 174.  Frame AS16-110-<a href="images16.html#18010" target="new">18010</a> suggests that they may have put it on a somewhat easterly heading.  Because they don't re-initialize the Rover Nav system before the leave for Station 6, the indicated Rover heading and the bearing to the LM will be off by the difference between the initial heading of 174 and whatever the heading was after they moved the Rover.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Like I always say, 'If you don't like your parking place, you just pick it up and walk off with it.'  It was easy to pick up.  I don't remember the details.  I'm trying to picture it in my mind; but, apparently, we parked and it was pointed down a slope and there was a little bench behind us, so we just picked it up and hauled it back.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;One at either side at the midpoint?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  You just get out, right where your seat was, and there was a handle on the frame.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Both hands on the handle?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember exactly, but I think both hands on the handle.  It was sort of like you could reach up and...There was a handle down there and, also, you could reach up under the chassis and pick it up - spread your hands apart a little bit, that gave you a little balance on the thing.  It was easy to do.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:16:39</b> Duke: Okay.  Our little note here in the checklist (on
<a href="a16eva2LMP-10.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-10</a>), Tony, doesn't mean too much.  We seem to be on a bench here that's
about 50 meters wide, and the slope here on the bench is only about 2
degrees - maybe 3 or 4 degrees - maybe 10.  No, about 5 degrees, I'd say. 
And...

<blockquote><i>[Fendell begins a counter-clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:17:02</b> Young: Houston, here's about a foot-and-a-half across
secondary...(correcting himself)  looks like a primary - that cut into the
upper rim of this 10- or 20-meter - yeah - this 20-meter secondary.  How
about sampling out of the wall of that one?<p>

<b>145:17:27</b> Duke: John, I don't think this big crater is a
secondary.<p>

<b>145:17:31</b> Young: That's what I mean.  But this...<p>

<b>145:17:33</b> Duke: That little one is.<p>

<b>145:17:34</b> Young: This little bitty one is probably a primary, too,
because look at the glass on the bottom.  Man, you've got to have velocity
to do that.<p>

<b>145:17:42</b> Duke: Yeah, I agree.

<blockquote><i>[Ejecta from South Ray would impact at too low a velocity to
create glass, although it could deposit glass created in the South Ray
impact itself.  John and Charlie have commented on several rocks with glass
coatings, which was probably acquired as the rocks were being dug out of
South Ray.  A primary impact, on the other hand, usually will involve an
impactor traveling 20 km/s or more and that is more than enough velocity to
vaporize the impactor and melt some of the target material.  Most of the crews found and commented on small fresh craters with a puddle of glass in the bottom.]<p>

[Fendell finds John and Charlie.  As indicated in <a href="a16ppD4f14.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 14</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of the

<b>145:17:43</b> England: Okay, does it look like it knocked out any rocks?

<blockquote><i>[Even on the lunar mare, the regolith layer is 4 to 5 meters thick and a typical 0.5 meter crater will have dug down only 10 to 15 centimeters and will not have brought up bedrock.  It could, however, have punched through the South Ray ejecta blanket and have brought up samples of Descartes that were already buried in the regolith at the time of South Ray
- if this small crater formed more recently than South
Ray.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:17:50</b> Young: Yeah.  I don't think the rocks that are there were

<b>145:18:16</b> England: Okay.  Sounds like a good plan.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has hopped up to the crater rim about ten meters beyond the gnomon and turns to face the Rover.  His locator is AS16-110-<a href="images16.html#18020" target="new">18020</a>.  In the foreground, John has done one swath with the rake and is shaking the dirt

<b><a name="1452011">145:20:11</a></b> Young: (Returning to his description

on the plains.<p>

<b>145:20:22</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John pours a second rakeful of soil.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:20:24</b> Duke: That's good, John.  It's about a kilo.<p>

<b>145:20:25</b> Young: It's somewhere between the gray of the surface and
the white material that we picked up out on the plains.  And we got a
bagful of most of that from scooping underneath the rock sample.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie spins the bag, folds the tabs, and puts the bag in

</i></blockquote>

<b>145:20:40</b> England: Okay.  And, after this, we'd like you to move to the rim of the main crater, and spend some time just describing the rocks you see, and then sample the rim.

<blockquote><i>[Clearly, Houston thinks they have not yet sampled the main crater at this site.  Charlie's prior description of it being a
&quot;blocky rim&quot; crater at <a href="#1450841" target="new">145:08:41</a> probably led people in Houston to believe there
is something more like the Station 4 crater in the immediate vicinity.]<p>

[Charlie hops backwards up to the crater rim.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1452052">145:20:52</a></b> Young: Okay.  I

<b>145:21:10</b> Duke: I don't see it.<p>

<b>145:21:11</b> England: Okay.  We'd like a documented glass sample, if
you have a chance.

<blockquote><i>[After examining the glass sample, John drops it to the

<b>145:21:17</b> Young: That wasn't big enough to document.<p>

<b>145:21:19</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>145:21:20</b> Duke: Okay; we'll look for a rock that's glass-coated,
Tony.<p>

<b>145:21:22</b> England: Okay, fine.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John has turned to look at the south wall of the
crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:21:27</b> Young: If we were to sample on the upslope side of this
crater where it's shielded...I mean, shielded toward South Ray...(If we
sampled) in the (shielded) wall...If it (meaning the crater) wasn't caused
by South Ray, then we ought to be looking at the real Descartes.<p>

<b>145:21:51</b> England: Okay.  That sounds like a good idea.<p>

<b>145:21:52</b> Duke: That's a good plan.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[What John may be saying is that, if the main Station 5
crater is older than South Ray, the south wall would not have been struck
by much South Ray ejecta, having been shielded by the rim.  However, during
the Technical Debrief, he voiced a different hypothesis.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It became apparent after we
were at Station 4 that we weren't going to get what everybody thought was
true Descartes, because we kept picking up what looked like South Ray
ejecta.  The only way we could think to do it was to sample towards the
South Ray side of the secondaries, or find a primary and sample there.  It
just wasn't clear that any of those things (meaning the small craters they
saw on the side of Stone Mountain) were primaries, because of the way those
blocks were distributed in them.  They (meaning the blocks)'re all on the
side away from South Ray.  Maybe there were a few primaries up there, but
we sure didn't see any, did we?&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;No.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It makes you think that there's a lot of craters on the Moon that must be secondaries.  This is the first time that we've had a clear-cut example of it.  A lot of those craters on the Moon must be secondaries - as opposed to (high-velocity primary) impact craters, because they don't look any different except for the block distribution.  As many secondaries as the South Ray must have made in that region, it is sure clear there must be a lot of craters that are not primary impact craters.  I mean a lot.&quot;]<p>

[Because this is a highlands site, the problem is distinguishing secondaries dug by South Ray ejecta and very old, eroded, primaries and secondaries.  All would be expected to have pieces of South Ray ejecta on the side away from South Ray.  The Apollo 14 crew also landed at a highlands site, but one without the complication of a young, nearby crater on the scale of South Ray.  Shepard and Mitchell encountered countless eroded craters that literally overlapped each other and most of these were probably very old.  I expect that many of the craters Young and Duke saw are also very old.]<p>

[John walks around the inside of the crater to the west wall while Charlie walks toward the south, angling away from the rim, and then stops to look at a rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:22:02</b> Duke: Okay, Tony...Here's a glass-covered one, John, right here.<p>

<b>145:22:08</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>145:22:09</b> Duke: Remember that right by this...Right by that footprint.  (Pause)  Right where I stopped walking.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie starts down into the crater to join John.  Before doing so, he reached forward with his right foot and planted a prominent footprint to mark the galls-covered rock.  He then moved sideways down onto the inner crater wall so that there would be no doubt about where he 'stopped walking'.  From the following dialog, I infer that John is not at the bottom of the crater but is on the wall, still well up from the bottom, although that fact is not obvious from the TV picture.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:22:17</b> Duke: Man, you're going to get me down in that crater.<p>

<b><a name="1452219">145:22:19</a></b> Young: No, I'm not.<p>

<b>145:22:20</b> Duke: I'm not going to get a down-Sun of that.

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;We're inside the crater.  We're inside the rim and, to the left, it went way down, deeper.  It just seemed too dangerous to try to get down there so we could get a down-Sun picture.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:22:23</b> Young: I don't think you ought to.<p>

<b>145:22:24</b> England: No, let's forget the down-Sun.<p>

<b>145:22:25</b> Duke: I'll get the cross-Sun, okay?<p>

<b>145:22:27</b> Young: Yeah.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes a cross-Sun &quot;before&quot; from the north and then hops to his right - upslope - to get a stereo companion.  These are AS16-110-
<a href="images16.html#18021" target="new">18021</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18022" target="new">18022</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>145:22:31</b> Young: (Facing south) Now, the only rocks we see are
really angular, and they're on this rim.  And I guess the problem is it was
a cratering event was probably so long ago.  There's just not even a hint
of any ledges or bedrock in this rascal.

<blockquote><i>[A fresh Crater which has penetrated through the regolith to bedrock will show a bench partway down the wall at a depth that corresponds to the base of the regolith.  The Apollo 12 and 15 crews saw a number of craters with benches on the mare.  As a crater is eroded by the constant rain of small impactors, the benches are worn away and covered.  Here, however, the lack of a bench is probably due to the fact that the crater is not large enough to have reached the regolith base.  Analyses present in USGS Professional Paper 1048 indicates that typical regolith thicknesses at the Apollo 16 site are 5 to 10 m, with the 12 meter depth determined with the active seismic (thumper) experiment being at the high end of the range.

The 25-m Station 5 crater would have penetrated to a depth of about 6
meters and probably did not reach bedrock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:22:56</b> Duke: John, why don't you take the rake right here in
front of the gnomon.  I've already documented that area.  And see what you
get?

<blockquote><i>[John turns to his left, going halfway around to face
Charlie.  As he turns, he stumbles slightly and his movements suggest he
standing on a slope.  In addition, the soil he kicks in the general
direction of the Rover clearly falls down a slope.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:23:04</b> Young: Take the rake (and) what, Charlie?<p>

<b>145:23:06</b> Duke: And just right here in front the gnomon and see what
you get.  One scoop and it might be...<p>

<b>145:23:12</b> Young: Okay.

<b>145:23:18</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  I don't think you're going to get
anything but soil.<p>

<b>145:23:29</b> Duke: I don't (think so), too.

<blockquote><i>[John stands with his left side slightly upslope, bends his
left knee until it is almost touching the ground and drags the rake through
the soil.  Both this swath and the next one are below the gnomon and run in
a north-south direction.  John then stands partway up and shakes the dirt
out.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:23:31</b> Duke: No, there's some rocks.  Two.<p>

<b>145:23:35</b> Young: Yeah.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John does another swath, this time without changing
position.  He shakes the soil out.  Charlie comes downslope, diagonally, to

[Jones - &quot;One thing I am always aware of in listening to the missions is constant stream of chatter at the geology station, really in all the missions, although particularly so in the J missions.  The notable exceptions are the 11 and 14 crews, so personality may play a big role; but I've wondered, too, if a factor in the talkativeness could have been the fact that your field-of-view was somewhat restricted in the helmet and you couldn't  always see each other.  Would there have been a tendency to talk
more as a result of that?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, I'm not conscious of that being the reason.  You're right; we had not only the normal visor - the <a href="../alsj-LEVA.html" target="new">LEVA</a> - that restricted some of the view, but then we pulled down these opaque sides on the helmet.  We had one that came down from the top and ones that came out from the side; and those were like putting blinders on!  I think the reason we talked so much is because we were just getting better at geology and we wanted to make good descriptions of what we were seeing.  To me it was just normal to
talk.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I'm glad you did!&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:23:51</b> Duke: Okay, there we go.  Why don't you hold the bag and let me pour it in?  Okay.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Apparently, John does not take a picture.]<p>

[England, from a 1996 letter - &quot;We planned to use the camera to help
guide the sampling.  We had seen features in the Apollo 14 pictures that we
would have liked to have had sampled and hoped that we could use the TV to
reduce the number of these misses.  In fact, we saw a few features that we
asked about and that sometimes led to changes in sampling, but John and
Charlie were such good observers that they didn't miss much.  The biggest
advantage was that John and Charlie didn't have to spend much time
explaining what they were doing.  I could stay ahead of them and have
information ready when they needed it.  Using the TV, I could also prod the
Backroom to think about some alternative strategies before the crew got to
the point where a decision had to be made.  It also aided the
thinking-out-loud periods when the crew and the ground were trying to
interpret what the crew was seeing.  We didn't do too much of that, but
there was some.  We were aware that if we proposed too strong of an idea
about what they were seeing, we might bias their sampling too much toward a
new hypothesis.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;While we wanted to take advantage of what was found to guide some of the
sampling, we also wanted to ensure that they sampled systematically.  In
the heat of the surface activities, it is easy to become captive of a new
idea that wouldn't stand up too well under more careful thought.&quot;]<p>

[Charlie is standing far enough down the slope that the gnomon is at about
waist level.  He reaches up with the rake and drags it a short distance
through the soil near the gnomon.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:28:52</b> Young: (That) was an old rock, wasn't it?<p>

<b>145:28:54</b> Duke: It was; it crumbled to pieces.  (Pause)

got any rocks.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1452802">145:28:02</a></b> Duke: That was fruitless there.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is hopping upslope sideways, leading with his right
foot.  He makes only slow progress.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Had you done any walking like this at a place like 
<a href="../alsj_whtsands.gif" title="image" target="new">White Sands</a> (National Monument near Alamogordo, New Mexico)?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Not in the suit.  We did, just in shirtsleeves.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;This looks very much like sidehill walking in that kind of
stuff.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Well, you can see we're having a real problem here,
maintaining our balance, getting started, and walking in a...You tended to
go downhill, tend to slide down.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was there any particular problem in the inflated suit with having one leg lower than the other one?  Did it produce any stress on the legs?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  I don't think so.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:29:07</b> Duke: I am.  I'm trying to get upslope on it.<p>

<b>145:29:10</b> Young: Here, let me.  Hand me the rake, I can get it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie steps on a little mound of soil, which crumbles under his weight.  He starts to fall forward and starts running in place, trying to get his feet under his center of gravity.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:29:14</b> Young: Careful, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets the rake planted on the ground and, using it for support, finally gets his body under control.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:29:16</b> Duke: There we go.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie scoops up the rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:29:28</b> Duke: Uh-oh.  Okay.  I got it.

<blockquote><i>[Although Charlie was blocking our view, it appears that, when they tried to get the rock out of the rake, it started to fall and Charlie had to do a little juggling act - rather like the ones he did at Station 1 and 2 - before he could catch it.]</i></blockquote>

any crystals in it?

<blockquote><i>[John gets an individual sample bag off his

<b>145:29:40</b> Duke: Yes, sir.  I sure can.  It's a bluish crystal, a
couple of millimeters size.<p>

<b>145:29:49</b> Young: Bluish?<p>

<b>145:29:51</b> Duke: Well, that's what it looked...Grayish maybe.  And
one corner of it's got a glass rind on it about half a centimeter thick.<p>

authors of the Professional Paper, is believed to be a piece of the
Descartes formation, primarily for the reason advanced by the crew.

collected at Station 4.]</i></blockquote>

anyway, the part that we can see.  The particles in it are millimeter size,
though.  I see some millimeter-size sparklies flashing at me.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie completes a long rake swath and then shakes the
dirt out.]<p>

[A breccia can, of course, contain crystalline
inclusions.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:30:30</b> Young: That's going in bag 403.<p>

<b>145:30:33</b> England: Okay, 403.

side, so John can stow sample bag 403.]</i></blockquote>

sliding downhill about 2 inches every time you...I can't get going, here. 
(Laughs; Pause)

Charlie plants the rake on the surface just to the left of the rock and then, holding the top of the rake handle in his left hand, leans forward, almost to the point where his right knee touches the ground, and grabs the rock.  At this point, John takes up-Sun photo AS16-107-

[Facing upslope, John starts digging into the crater wall at a point about
two meters clockwise and slightly upslope from the last gnomon position as

<blockquote><i>[It takes a bit of effort to get a sample from the bottom of the hole but, after several seconds, John stands and shakes the soil out.  Apparently he doesn't get many rocks.  He then runs the rake through the pile of dirt he removed from the hole.

<b>145:37:20</b> Young: Uh-huh.<p>

<b>145:37:21</b> Duke: Don't see any rocks.  Here let me do this.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has a bag out and takes up a position down slope of the hole so that John can pour the samples easily when he is
ready.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:37:35</b> Young: There's one.<p>

<b>145:37:42</b> Young: There's some.<p>

<b>145:37:44</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause as John pours)  Yeah, they're rocks
all right.  Going in bag 335.  Three little ones, Tony.<p>

<b>145:37:54</b> England: Okay.  We copy that.

rocks in the sample, 65925 to 927, which are shown in Figure 53B in

<b>145:37:56</b> Duke: No, they aren't; they're clods.  And they're clods,
not rocks.<p>

<b>145:38:03</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>145:38:05</b> Duke: But, anyway, 335.  Did I say 331?  335.<p>

<b>145:38:10</b> England: You said 335.<p>

<b>145:38:11</b> Duke: John, let me have the rake a minute.  Let me try
something.  Here you go.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie hands the bag to John and takes the
rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:38:16</b> England: Well, you think the rock concentration near the
surface is a lag surface, then?<p>

<b>145:38:27</b> Duke: Apparently so because, in this wall here, we're not
getting a thing.

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to the fact that, while they have found
rocks on the surface and down to a few inches, they haven't found many at
depth.]<p>

[Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message - &quot;My understanding of this (part of the dialog) is based on the common scene in a desert setting.  The usual gravel-covered surface in the desert is a lag gravel - meaning that the infrequent rains have washed away all the fine particles (sand or finer) leaving an 'armor' of gravel at the surface.  This is sometimes called 'desert pavement'.  Someday, when you are on one of these surfaces, get out a shovel and dig through it. You will find a surface layer of coarse material covering a layer of fine material with the occasional rock. I assume that is what Tony was asking the crew.&quot;]<p>

[England, from a 1996 e-mail message - &quot;Bill captured the meaning of my question, of course.  On Earth, if you have coarse material on a surface and fine material beneath, it got that way by winnowing - removal of the fine material.  To make a &quot;lag surface&quot; (most places) on the Moon, the coarse material was probably tossed in on top of the fine material.  Because the location (where John was digging) was on a slope, I was probably looking for a way that the fine material had worked its way down slope.  I was probably reaching a bit to even ask the question.  I might have done that as an hypothesis to get them to examine what they were seeing a little more closely.  It might also have been just a dumb question.&quot;]<p>

[Charlie makes his way upslope to the south side of the hole.  He turns and goes up backwards the last step or two.]<p>

about 6 inches down...<p>

<b>145:40:12</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>145:40:13</b> Duke: ...out of this crater.  (Pause)  You know, John, I
think if we got a running start straight at the Rover (across the crater),
we'd make it up the other side.<p>

<b>145:40:20</b> England: Ah, let's go the other way.<p>

<b>145:40:22</b> Young: Let's go around the rim.<p>

<b>145:40:23</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie presents his SCB and John stows the soil
sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:40:25</b> England: Okay, the plan back at the Rover is now we'd like
John to take an <a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">LPM</a> (Lunar
Portable Magnetometer) measurement and, Charlie, if you could sample around
the rim there near the Rover; and take both angular and round, whatever you
find.<p>

<b>145:40:38</b> Duke: Okay.  Sure will.

<blockquote><i>[John takes AS16-107-

<a href="images16.html#17509" target="new">17509</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>145:40:41</b> Young: (To Houston)  (Do you) really want...Okay.<p>

<b>145:40:46</b> England: Yep, we'd like an LPM.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie grabs the gnomon and starts counter-clockwise around the crater.  After a few steps, however, he decides to cut across the center of the crater to the Rover.  John continues around the wall.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>145:40:49</b> England: Incidentally, your magnetic field there is about 130 gammas back at the LSM (Lunar Surface Magnetometer, which is one of the ALSEP instruments).

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes down the slope with his body turned to his
right, leading with his left leg.  He makes five steps with his left foot. 
Once he reaches the bottom of the crater, he switches to his skipping
stride and is making good speed across the crater when he goes out of view to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:40:56</b> Young: How is it at the (Station 2) site measurement. 
Does it agree with that?<p>

<b>145:40:58</b> England: Okay.  I believe it was about 20 gammas less,
something like that 110 gammas.  It's...<p>

<b>145:41:02</b> Duke: (Laughs, probably as he heads up the near slope)<p>

<b>145:41:03</b> England: ...plunging pretty steeply.

<blockquote><i>[Tony's phrase, 'plunging pretty steeply', could be a reference to possible geographic variations in steady state magnetic field or to possible time variations due to interactions with the solar wind. 
According to the Apollo 16 <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the field strength
was 231 gammas at the ALSEP, 180 at Station 2, 125 gammas here at Station 5, 313 at Station 13 near North Ray Crater, and 121 at the final Rover parking place east of the LM.  Variations due to the solar wind were, in fact, less than about 5 gammas.  The field strength values Tony quotes here are the results of the first, rough analysis of the available data. 
Readers should note that, although the field orientation was similar at the
three sites near the LM (ALSEP, Station 2, and Rover parking place), the
field orientation at Stations 5 and 13 was dramatically different.  See
Table <a href="a16psrt12-ii.jpg" title="image" target="new">12-II</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:41:07</b> Duke: Hey, John.  It's easier to go straight across. That was fun.

<b>145:41:11</b> Young: Well, I haven't had any trouble.<p>

<b>145:41:12</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>145:41:13</b> Duke: I had a tough time walking up there, on the side
like that.<p>

<b>145:41:16</b> Young: I've got big feet today, Charlie.<p>

<b>145:41:18</b> Duke: Ah, so.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is referring, of course, to the size of his Lunar
boots.]<p>

[John reaches the Rover and goes out of view on the right side.  Fendell is
looking more or less southeast toward the summit of Stone Mountain and
starts panning left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:41:27</b> Young: Of course, 45 feet on an LPM (laughing) is gonna put me over the edge here.  I'm gonna go out at right angles to the Rover, around this crater rim, for this measurement, Houston.  It may not be exactly 45 feet, but it'll be close.<p>

<b>145:41:39</b> England: Okay.  That sounds good, John.

<blockquote><i>[John had not planned to do an LPM measurement at this site but, as shown on cuff checklist page 
<a href="a16eva3CDR44-45.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-45</a>, he would normally take the LPM sensor out 48 feet on the right side of the Rover.  As shown in <a href="a16ppD4f14.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 14</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of

<blockquote><i>[Fendell resumes his pan, just as Charlie goes out of view
to the left.  Fendell stops his leftward pan and pans right to follow. 
Most likely, he had hit the button to do another three-degree, leftward pan increment just before seeing Charlie move and, although he responded quickly, the inherent delays in the system meant that Charlie was out of view before the camera started moving to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:42:56</b> Duke: About 10 feet to the 4 o'clock position of the Rover.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell is now panning clockwise.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:43:01</b> England: Okay, John.  I guess we won't need a pan, if you can just get the LPM (locator photo).<p>

<b>145:43:09</b> Young: All right.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>145:43:31</b> England: Okay, John.  A minute (has elapsed).

<b><a name="1454932">145:49:32</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  I've got two more documented samples in bag 33...Two more rocks documented in 337.

<blockquote><i>[The first rock Charlie collected is sample 65056, a 75 gram &quot;glassy agglutinate&quot; with crystalline clasts.  It is shown in
Figure 47E in <a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">Professional Paper 1048</a>.  The second rock is 65055, a 500
gram crystalline rock shown in Figure 47D.  Both are believed to have been
ejecta from South Ray.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Charlie grabs the scoop and puts it in his right hand with the SCB.  He then uses the scoop as a cane as he tries to get down low enough to retrieve the tongs.  He doesn't make it on his first try and stands.  He then drops to his knees and his momentum takes him low enough that he grabs the tongs before the suit can force him up.]

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Do you have any comment about the length of these stations?  Were they long enough that you were feeling forearm fatigue or, maybe, feeling it in the legs?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  These were some of the longest stops we had.  Except up around North Ray.  That was a long one.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;That was an hour up there.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, we were an hour up at Cinco, almost.  You know,
watching this, it looks like we didn't get much done.  But the science guys
were real pleased.  I think you need to plan an hour or so at each stop
because, by the time you get off and get all the equipment ready and, you
know, talk back and forth and describe and just sit there and think, for a
few minutes, about what you're going to do, anything less than forty-five
minutes or an hour is short-sighted.  You just can't get it all done.  You
can't do a good job.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Is the efficiency starting to go down after an
hour?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Most places you could go longer?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah.  In a way, you get better because you get used to
the terrain and what you're walking on.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So you'd suggest at least forty-five minutes or an hour at a stop.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That's right.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:52:20</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  The samples are complete here.  I'm leaving with frame count number...(Pause)  Looks like about 170, Tony.  I'd better change mags before we start out here.  Over.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat with the extra SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:52:43</b> England: Okay.  Sounds good.  (Pause)  Okay.  And, while you're up there, you might adjust the DAC.  Maybe you can get it running.<p>

<b>145:52:55</b> Duke: I already did; and it'll be running (during the drive to Station 6).<p>

<b>145:52:57</b> England: Okay.  Good show.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds John at the back of the Rover where he is stowing the magnetometer cable.  Charlie reaches into the LMP seat pan and pulls out sample 65015 for examination.]

<b>145:53:04</b> Duke: John?<p>

<b>145:53:05</b> Young: Yes, sir.<p>

<b>145:53:06</b> Duke: That is the best sample we got.<p>

<b>145:53:07</b> Young: I know it.<p>

<b>145:53:10</b> Duke: I'll tell you.  That is a crystalline rock if I've ever seen a crystalline rock.<p>

<b>145:53:14</b> Young: First one today!<p>

<b>145:53:16</b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie re-stows the sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:53:17</b> Young: (Laughing) At least the first one you could say was one, maybe.  (Lost under Charlie)<p>

<b>145:53:19</b> Duke: That is a great rock.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie puts his seat down and then removes his used film magazine.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:53:25</b> Duke: Okay, John, when you get around there (to the CDR seat), could you give me a film mag?  Black and white?<p>

<b>145:53:30</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>145:53:31</b> England: I guess we could...<p>

<b>145:53:31</b> Duke: Which one do you want me to use, Tony?<p>

<b>145:53:32</b> England: Call that one the &quot;Great Young.&quot;

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to Apollo 15 sample 15555, a 9.6 kg basalt known as Great Scott that Dave Scott collected at the edge of Hadley Rille.  Great Scott is the second largest rock returned by the Apollo astronauts.  Only Big Muley, the 11.6 kg breccia Charlie collected at Flag Crater is larger.  For reference, the largest Apollo 14 rock is a 9.0 kg breccia known as Big Bertha.  It was collected by Al Shepard near the rim of Cone Crater at Station C1; and the largest Apollo 17 rock is 70215, an 8.1 kilogram basalt Jack Schmitt collected near the LM.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>145:53:37</b> Young: (Responding to Tony)  Oh, come on.<p>

<b>145:53:40</b> Duke: It's not very big, but it's just a nice rock.<p>

<b>145:53:44</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie raises his seat again to stow the film magazine and John goes to the CDR seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:53:46</b> Young: Yeah, it was made about...It looks like it's about 3 days old (pause) though it must be on the order of 4 billion.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie lowers his seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:53:57</b> Young: Which one do you want, Charlie?<p>

<b>145:53:59</b> Duke: Any black and white.  It doesn't matter.  Wrong (underseat) pocket.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie leans across his seat to watch what John is doing.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:54:06</b> Young: Any black and white?<p>

<b>145:54:07</b> Duke: Yeah, ain't but one...<p>

<b>145:54:24</b> Duke: There you go.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Do you have any comments on the detailed finger-work that was involved in manipulating the dark slide?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Practice.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Never having worn those <a href="A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new">gloves</a>, it seems almost amazing to me that you can manipulate that dark slide.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Big objects you could handle, like those film mags.  You could hold the magazine with fingertips at each side, and it had a little slide at the bottom.  You just dropped it in and held it forward and then there was a lock at the top.  I had to practice, but it was pretty easy to do.  We didn't have any trouble.  It took me a little bit to get that one locked - two or three tries - but no more than normal.  You get much smaller than that, though, and that was the hard part - trying to manipulate little, small objects with those gloves.  Threading a needle would be almost impossible in those gloves.  The bigger the object, with the bulky gloves, the easier it was to get a purchase on them and do what you've got to do.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;That film magazine looked like it was maybe fist-sized or a little bit smaller.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It's fist-sized; yeah.&quot;]

[It wasn't until March 2006 that I realized that the <a href="../alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="new">dark slide</a> had a wire handle large enough to accomodate the glove fingers.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:54:27</b> Young: Okay.  Dark slide is in the camera box (under the seat).  (Pause)<p>

<b>145:54:35</b> Duke: (Examining the magazine)  Hope it runs;  I got dust on it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie installs the magazine.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1455442">145:54:42</a></b> Young: (Garbled)  (Pause)  (Garbled)

useful.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:54:51</b> England: Okay, we can...<p>

<b>145:54:52</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>145:54:53</b> England: ...see it works.<p>

<b>145:54:55</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  (Stops to listen)  Yeah, magazine India (which is also known as AS16-108).<p>

<b>145:54:59</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>145:55:01</b> Duke: And starting with frame count number about 3.  I guess I fired off a couple.<p>

<b>145:55:07</b> England: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie appears to examine his checklist, probably looking
at either <a href="a16eva2LMP-10.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-10</a>, the Station 5 page, or <a href="a16eva2LMP-11.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-11</a>, the Station 6 page.  He then reaches to turn on the 16-mm camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:55:24</b> Young: Okay, we're ready to press here.<p>

<b>145:55:27</b> England: Okay, and just to make sure you didn't get any dust on that LCRU while you're working around there, we would like you to brush it off again.  We're really heating up on that.<p>

<b>145:55:36</b> Young: It's clean!<p>

<b>145:55:38</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>145:55:40</b> Duke: (Looking at the LCRU) It is clean.<p>

<b>145:55:43</b> Young: Yeah, it's clean.  Honest!<p>

<b>145:55:46</b> England: Okay.  That's okay.<p>

<b>145:55:49</b> Young: Want to shut it down for a while?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The LRV shakes, possibly as John does some dusting at the front of the vehicle.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:55:55</b> England: No.  That's all right.  And, Charlie, on your LRV readouts, we won't be needing Volts, so why don't we just leave that switch in Amps?<p>

<b>145:56:05</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause as he reaches across to change the switch)  Got it in Amps.<p>

<b>145:56:14</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>145:56:16</b> Young: Okay.  It's dusted.  Going downhill (from Station 4), it doesn't get near as much dust as it did coming up, for some reason.  (Pause) Maybe that's because (chuckles) it was 4 kilometers one way (from the LM to Station 4) and half of one the other (from Station 4 to 5).  That's probably the reason.<p>

<b>145:56:37</b> Duke: (Grabbing the inboard handhold) I hope I can get back in this beauty here now.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie was standing beside his seat, facing directly forward, but now turns slightly so that, when he pushes up and back, he will be moving toward the seat back.  He jumps and, possibly, pulls himself inboard with his left arm.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:56:42</b> Young: You're in!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[When Charlie lands, he isn't squarely in the seat but quickly gets himself settled by planting his feet, lifting his rear off the seat and sliding sideways.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you do any training in the one-sixth-g airplane for getting on the Rover.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  We did that.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;What was involved in an aircraft exercise?  You'd be up for several hours, right?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh.  Well, it depended on how many parabolas you could take before you got sick.  I could go a couple of hours.  Some guys, you know, two or three hours the airplane'd run out of gas and they never got sick.  Nobody actually got sick, at least in the crew, 'cause you'd stop before you actually throw up.  But you'd start feeling woozy - at least I would - and then I'd just stop and then we'd go back and land.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;How big an area did you  have in the back of the
aircraft.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was a 707.  Thirty or forty feet.  We could get a Rover back there and a pallet or so.  There was just plenty of room.  You couldn't do much walking.  I mean, you couldn't take the cables out to the ends, of course; you just practiced putting the experiments down.  And getting in and out of the Rover and setting up the Rover and putting on the LCRU and getting the TV mounted and all the plugs and all of that stuff.  It was pretty good training, really.  You just had to do it in short spurts.  You couldn't build a good timeline from that, is one
problem.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Would you have several support people in there with
you?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  'Cause they'd have to help you get up and get you down.  When you start to pull out (of the dive that gives one-sixth g), it's a 2 1/2-g pull-out and, you know, 360 pounds is a lot of weight and your legs couldn't support it.  So, as the airplane started out, they'd ring a big bell and, if you couldn't get down, two guys'd would slam you to the floor and you just sort spread-eagled on the floor while doing this 2 1/2 gs.  Then, when you were ready to push over the next parabola, the guys would help you get up so you'd be ready to go when you got to the right g level.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Boy, that sounds tiring for them.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, it wasn't too bad.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Spread eagle face down?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Generally face down.  Sometimes you'd be face up; it didn't matter.  And when I say spread-eagle, your arms might be down by your side or you might be on your elbows; but you were on the floor so you didn't have to stand 2 1/2 gs in that suit.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You had 30 seconds of one-sixth g...?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;30 to 40...&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And then how long to climb up the other side of the parabola?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Maybe a minute or two.  They had to dive and accelerate and get up to speed, and then he had to make that turn and then he had to establish climbing up at the right kind of pitch attitude.  And then he'd push over.  It was probably twice the time, or more, doing that
part.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;NASA aircraft?  NASA crew?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Used to be an Air Force aircraft, but now it belongs to NASA.  And I think they provide the crew and everything.  In fact, I know they do, now.  Back then, I think it was an Air Force crew.  They'd fly it down from Wright-Pat(terson AFB) to Houston or Kennedy.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you do those exercises frequently?  Or just a few of them?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember.  We didn't do that many.  In 2 1/2 years, ten times, maybe.  It was pretty good training for, you know, balance and experiments and getting in and out of the Rover and stuff like that.  Like I say, for building timelines, it wasn't very good.  So we'd build a timeline out behind the MSOB (Manned Spacecraft Operations Building), at our training site.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
