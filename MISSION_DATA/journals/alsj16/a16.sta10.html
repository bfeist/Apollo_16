<b>148:57:33</b> Duke: Okay, lets see.  There's the core.  I need the (garbled).  Okay;  we got them.<p>

<b><a name="1485747">148:57:47</a></b> Duke: And I'm starting on the double
core, Tony.<p>

<b>148:57:50</b> England: Okay, that sounds good.  (Pause)  And, John, since we're running behind here, I wonder if you can operate the penetrometer.<p>

<b><a name="1485807">148:58:07</a></b> Duke: (Possibly while he assembles the double core) A piece of cake.<p>

<b>148:58:10</b> Young: (Responding to Tony) Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[The TV image moves up and down as John dusts.  He then swings the TV around to the right and dusts the lens with the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">big dustbrush</a>.  Once John finishes, <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pans left, probably to get to the counter-clockwise stop so he can start a full pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1485817">148:58:17</a></b> Young: Why don't you just give us an extension?<p>

<b>148:58:23</b> Duke: Tony, how about an extension, you guys?  We're feeling good.<p>

<b>148:58:26</b> England: Oh, we understand and we can understand why you wouldn't want to get back in, but we'd like you to get back in on time.  And you've got a lot of science (done) there, so don't worry about it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reaches the CCW limit and promptly starts a clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:58:47</b> Young: You said all we was gonna do tonight is sit around and talk!<p>

<b>148:58:52</b> England: Well, we like to hear you talk. <p>

<b>148:58:57</b> Duke: Tony, we could really...<p>

<b>148:58:59</b> Young: (Responding to Tony)  Yeah, especially on a hot mike, huh?  (Laughs)<p>

<b>148:59:01</b> England: That just makes it more interesting.<p>

<b>148:59:05</b> Duke: Ten minutes (extension) and we could get all this done, Tony.  How about 10 minutes, Tony?  Please.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[In Houston, TELMU informs Flight that the current record for an EVA is 7 hours 12 minutes.  Clearly, Houston understands the crew's interest in staying out a little longer.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:59:14</b> Duke: John, you got the shovel...Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[John crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left, headed for the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1485916">148:59:16</a></b> Young: Look at that, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[John has just noticed that his SCB had fallen off his PLSS sometime during the drive from Station 9 but ended up wedged on the inside of the left-rear fender.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:59:17</b> Duke: What?  I don't see.  What?  What?  (Pause)  What?<p>

<b>148:59:23</b> Young: Somebody up there likes us.  That bag number 4, see where it is?<p>

<b>148:59:29</b> Duke: Came off, huh?<p>

<b>148:59:30</b> Young: Came off, (incredulous) and it's hanging between the fender and the frame.<p>

<b>148:59:36</b> Duke: That is amazing.<p>

<b>148:59:37</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b><a name="1485941">148:59:41</a></b> Duke: Okay, can I have your hammer?  (Looking at <a href="a16eva2LMP-18.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-18</a>
and <a href="a16eva2LMP-19.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-19</a>) &quot;Double core&quot;...Okay, can be anywhere out in front of the Rover.  I'll go out in front of the Rover and do (garbled)  (Pause)<p>

<b>148:59:55</b> Young: (Garbled)

<blockquote><i>[In Houston, Flight has been talking to the Surgeon about a 10-minute extension.  The Surgeon says that his only concern is that it not shorten the sleep period.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:00:00</b> Duke: Come on, Tony.  Pretty please?<p>

<b>149:00:01</b> England: We're working it!  (Getting the go-ahead from Flight) Okay, we'll go ahead and give you 10 minutes.<p>

<b>149:00:06</b> Young: Tony, is...<p>

<b>149:00:07</b> England: How's that?  Just shows that we love you.<p>

<b>149:00:10</b> Duke: Atta boy.  Let's hear it for old Flight. An

<b>149:00:26</b> Duke: (To Tony)  Okay.

<blockquote><i>[After scanning across the South Ray ejecta blanket.  Fendell is not looking at the ALSEP array.  Charlie crosses the field-of-view from right to left carrying the double core.  As shown in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-13</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, he will take the double core 10 meters south of the Rover at the spot marked &quot;DT (Drive Tube) 60010/60009.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:00:29</b> Young: Want me to help you with the penetrometer?<p>

<b>149:00:32</b> Duke: Well, I've got the double core right now.

<blockquote><i>[John's Station 10 tasks were the trenching and a
pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:00:36</b> England: Okay, we'll still drop the trench...<p>

<b>149:00:38</b> Young: Okay;  well, this would be an opportunity for me...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>149:00:39</b> England: ...and do everything else as nominal.

<blockquote><i>[John may have decided to start with the pan or, possibly, to do some sampling.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:00:46</b> Duke: I bet you I don't get this (double core) in here, but I'll try it.<p>

<b>149:00:49</b> Young: I think you will.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is concerned that the number of rocks on the surface indicates a high probability of running into subsurface rocks with the core tube.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:00:55</b> Duke: (Straining) I don't know.  Okay, that's pushed in.<p>

<b>149:00:59</b> Young: Let me do that, and you do the penetrometer because I know how to do that one.<p>

<b>149:01:02</b> Duke: Okay.  That's a good swap.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is saying that he hadn't done much, if any, training with the penetrometer but had done some coring.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:01:10</b> Duke: Gummit.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has probably backed up to take a cross-Sun &quot;before&quot;.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:01:14</b> Duke: John, see if I got the red dot on my camera.  It stopped running.<p>

<b>149:01:22</b> Young: Sure do.<p>

<b>149:01:23</b> Duke: Okay, how about spinning it once for me.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;The red dot is something to do with the winding mechanism.  When it was winding, if I remember, there was a red dot (showing).  And if that stayed there, it hadn't wound all the way, and so it wouldn't work.  But you could manually wind it to the next frame, and that would generally reset the thing and then you could pull the trigger and then it would work.  But you couldn't do it yourself.  So the other fellow had to wind it for you.  And it was like a manual wind on the top of the electric one.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;On the film cassette.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I think.  I don't really remember where it was, but I
think it was.&quot;]<p>

[Journal Contributor Markus Mehring suggests that the &quot;red dot  is a readout on the right side of each magazine, right between the top reel and the bottom indicator for 'frames shot/remaining'. It must be hard - if not impossible - to observe if the camera is attached to the RCU, unless you use the wrist-mirror.  See a discussion of the wrist mirrors following <a href="../a17/a17.eva3prep.html#1631953" target="new">163:19:53</a> in the A17LSJ.  Parenthetically, I wonder if the astronauts could feel the vibrations of the motor through their suit, validating proper film transport?. With regard to the manual film transport Charlie describes, I have absolutely no idea of how that would have been accomplished, and why an astronaut couldn't have done that himself. There's no mechanism for manual film transport on this generation of Hasselblads, so this might have been an improvised workaround, maybe by pressing your finger(s) or thumb flat onto the reel attachment and then turning it. That would indeed be quite difficult with the <a href="A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new">gloves</a> on in a pressurized suit, and you'd possibly need a helping hand, especially if the camera is still attached to the RCU.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell reaches the clockwise stop and is looking north, over the
back of the Rover.  John and Charlie are both at the core tube
site.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:01:37</b> Young: (Garbled) I went to...There you go.<p>

<b><a name="1490143">149:01:43</a></b> Duke: That got it, though.<p>

<b>149:01:45</b> Young: Got it.<p>

<b>149:01:46</b> Duke: Super.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[After John advanced the film - which caused frame
AS16-115-18554 to be blank - Charlie took two test pictures, AS16-115-
<a href="images16.html#18555" target="new">18555</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18556" target="new">18556</a>.  In <a href="images16.html#18555" target="new">18555</a>, note that the rock that is just right and below center, with a smaller rock in front of it, is at the upper left in 
<a href="images16.html#18557" target="new">18557</a>, which is the cross-Sun.]<p>

[Fendell starts panning left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:01:50</b> Duke: I'll get it, (meaning a) cross-Sun (of the core tube) as far you (meaning Charlie, himself) can push it in.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-115-
<a href="images16.html#18557" target="new">18557</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18558" target="new">18558</a>.  In 
<a href="images16.html#18557" target="new">18557</a>, we see that he has pushed the first section of the core in about 2/3rds of the way by hand.  The rock at the upper left may be the one below center and to the right in <a href="images16.html#18555" target="new">18555</a>.  John is in the background.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:01:54</b> Duke: Okay.  You want to hammer on this?<p>

<b>149:01:55</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>149:01:58</b> Duke: Okay; now the stuff to...(Brief Pause while Charlie searches for a word) <p>

<b>149:02:01</b> Young: (Finishing the thought) Take it apart with.<p>

<b>149:02:02</b> Duke: ...take it apart with, it's back in the back (of the Rover).<p>

<b>149:02:03</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<blockquote><i>[My thanks to Ken Glover for sorting out Charlie's meaning.  A comma after 'with' and an apostrophe in 'it's' makes all the difference.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:02:04</b> Duke: They want you to take both of them (meaning the coupled core sections) off (the extension handle) together and then ram it home before you separate the two.<p>

<b>149:02:12</b> Young: Understand.<p>

<b>149:02:13</b> Duke: And the top of the bottom one is back here next to the LSM (Lunar Surface Magnetometer).<p>

<b>149:02:17</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie crosses the field-of-view from left to right.  He is going to get the penetrometer, which is mounted on the back of the Rover.]<p>

[The &quot;top of the bottom one&quot; is the top end closure of the bottom core tube as shown at the left in 
<a href="../tools/judy15.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 15</a> in Judy Allton's <a href="../tools/Welcome.html" target="new">Tool Book</a>.  Had this lower section been used by itself, Charlie would have left the top end closure on the tube so he could fit it into the extension handle.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:02:20</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, which...You want me to start with the 0.5?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is asking Tony which of the cone-shaped tips he should use on the penetrometer.  See Figure <a href="a16psrf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new">8-1</a> in the Preliminary Science Report and the Station 4 discussion following <a
href="a16.sta4.html#1442438" target="new">144:24:38</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:02:27</b> England: Right, it will be the 0.5...Well, actually you have the 0.2 on there.  Why don't you do the string of 0.2 (as shown in <a href="a16eva2LMP-19.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-19</a>) and then we'll come back and get the 0.5 near the double core.<p>

<b><a name="1490238">Video Clip</a></b>

<b>149:02:38</b> Duke: Well;  no, I took the 0.2 off. <p>

<b>149:02:41</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>149:02:42</b> Duke: I don't have anything on here now.<p>

<b>149:02:44</b> England: Fine, let's press for the 0.5.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds John south of the Rover, where he is
hammering on the double core.  Stone Mountain is behind him and the South Ray ejecta blanket is visible on the right edge of the picture.  John stops hammering for a moment and re-adjusts his grip.  He then resumes hammering.  We can see that there is no SCB on the left side of his PLSS and that an attachment strap is hanging down.  NASA photo <a href="a16.s72_33898.jpg" title="image" target="new">S72-33898</a> shows Charlie driving a double core during training at the Kennedy Space Center on 22 March 1972.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:02:49</b> Duke: Okay.  It gets hard down there, doesn't it, John?

<blockquote><i>[John delivers five more blows and then stops to re-adjust his grip.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:02:54</b> Young: Yeah, I don't think it's going to go.  (To Tony) , "How many hits you want me to give it, Houston, before I quit.

<blockquote><i>[While talking to Tony, John delivered three more blows and then stopped and transferred the hammer to his left hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:03:05</b> England: Okay, it's not going down at all?

<blockquote><i>[John delivers three left-handed blows.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:03:15</b> Duke: Yeah, you're getting it a little bit, John.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John transfers the hammer back to his right hand and positions the head so he can hit the extension handle with the head rather than the flat.  The surface area of the head is only about a quarter of the area of the flat.  See <a href="../tools/judy34.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 34</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Book.  For scale, the total length of the hammer is 39 cm.  The extension handle is shown in <a href="../tools/judy29.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure
29</a>.  For scale, the extension handle is 76 cm long and the T handle is 15.5 cm long.]<p>

[John delivers five accurate blows and then stops to rest.  A
comparison with video of Charlie and others using the flat of the hammer to drive core tubes into the ground is another indication of John's incredible ability to work effectively in the suit.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:03:21</b> Duke: It's going in, John;  about a quarter inch a
stroke.<p>

<b>149:03:23</b> Young: That figures.

<blockquote><i>[John resumes hammering, righthanded, with the head.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1490328">149:03:28</a></b> Duke: No, a little bit more than that.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[After delivering eight more blows, John stops briefly and then, on the next blow, loses his grip on the down stroke.  The hammer hits the ground at his feet with considerable force.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:03:38</b> Young: Ohhh!<p>

<b>149:03:40</b> Duke: I did the same...<p>

<b>149:03:41</b> Young: Whoa!

<blockquote><i>[The hammer bounces and almost ends up upright with the handle sticking up in easy reach.  John tries to get it to stop rotating - with his &quot;Whoa!&quot; - but, after a tantalizing moment of hesitation, it finally falls.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:03:42</b> Duke: I did the same thing.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John circles the hammer and gets into position east of it
so he can bob down to his right knee and grab it.  He does so with ease
and, as he rises, he takes a couple of small steps forward to get his feet
under his center of gravity.  This is a classic piece of John Young in
action.  See the discussion following <a href="a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new">119:24:37</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:03:59</b> England: John, it's too late to change your mind;  you got
to hammer that one;  no trenches.

<blockquote><i>[John has resumed his hammering, righthanded, and delivers nine blows before stopping for a bit of rest.  This series is not as accurate as the ones he struck before dropping the hammer.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:04:07</b> Young: Crazy.  (Laughs)  Should have kept my mouth shut.<p>

<b>149:04:12</b> Duke: Dadgummit!  That thing came off again.

<blockquote><i>[John switches the hammer to his left hand and delivers two blows with the flat before he stops and  <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">reaches back with his right hand to increase the flow rate of cooling feedwater</a>.]<p>

[Charlie seems to be having some kind of trouble with the penetrometer but made no comment about it in the post-mission Technical Debrief or in the Mission Report.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:04:16</b> England: It may have a bad latch in it. <p>

<b>149:04:23</b> Young: Now I'm on Intermediate cooling, Houston.

<blockquote><i>[John delivers six more left-handed blows with the flat and then stops briefly.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:04:26</b> England: Okay, John, you've probably hammered on that long enough.  Why don't we just call it enough.

<blockquote><i>[John resumes hammering.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:04:32</b> Duke: It's in!  John, it's in.  That's far (enough)...

<blockquote><i>[John stops and steps back.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:04:36</b> Young: How far do you want to drive it, Charlie?<p>

<b>149:04:38</b> Duke: That's far enough!<p>

<b>149:04:39</b> Young: Drive it all the way in?<p>

<b>149:04:41</b> Duke: Yeah, they don't want any more than that.<p>

<b>149:04:42</b> England: Okay, that looks good.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John grabs the extension handle with his right hand and
starts to pull up.  The core resists him and he steps in until he is almost
straddling it.  He jerks the core tube upward a couple of times, leaning to
his left to compensate for the fact that the extension handle is higher off
the ground after each pull.  In a final effort, he pulls the core loose
and, in the process, actually leaves the ground.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:04:51</b> Young: Aghh!

<blockquote><i>[As the core comes out of the ground, a noticeable amount of
dirt falls to the surface but, as John reports at <a href="#1490627"
target="new">149:06:27</a>, none of that dirt is actually coming out of the
core but, rather, is material that came out on the outside of the tube
because of friction.]<p>

[John rests the bit end on the surface.  The top of the extension
handle is at about eye level.  The total length is a bit less than the 160
cm sum of the 76 cm of the extension handle plus 42 cm apiece for the core
tubes.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:04:52</b> Young: Gee, it came right back out, too.<p>

<b>149:04:53</b> Duke: Yeah, that's the amazing part.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:05:00</b> Young: That is amazing.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John backs up to take an &quot;after&quot; of the hole from
the south.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:05:09</b> England: Okay, John, you want to turn that over?  That
stuff may come out of that.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>149:05:35</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John inverts the double core while Fendell zooms in on the
core hole.  John is using magazine 114 and, apparently, doesn't actually
take a picture of the hole.  He starts running toward the Rover and goes out of view to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:05:36</b> Duke: Okay, I finally got that five-tenths (tip) back on.  And I got number 6 (position on the recording drum), Tony.  Is that okay?  (Pause; no answer)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie crosses the field-of-view from right to left,
carrying the penetrometer, and John follows.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:05:53</b> Duke: I don't think I've used 6.  (Pause; no answer)<p>

<b>149:06:02</b> Young: Where are the core caps at, Charlie?<p>

<b>149:06:04</b> Duke: In the HTC.  How about an answer, Tony?<p>

<b>149:06:09</b> England: Say again, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has his back to us but he is clearly adjusting the
recording drum.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:06:11</b> Duke: I'll bypass...I'm on 9...<p>

<b>149:06:13</b> England: Yeah, 9's good, Charlie.<p>

<b>149:06:14</b> Duke: I'm going to bypass 9 and go to 10. <p>

<b>149:06:17</b> England: Okay, that's fine, too.<p>

<b>149:06:18</b> Duke: I just passed it on.  I'm going to go to 10. 
(Hearing Tony)  Okay.  (Pause)  Let's see, there's...<p>

<b><a name="1490627">149:06:27</a></b> Young: Okay, it's full in the bottom of it, anyway.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie positions the penetrometer about two meters east of the double-core hole.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:06:31</b> England: Okay.  And that one should be fairly near the double core, Charlie.<p>

<b>149:06:38</b> Duke: It is, within 3 meters...2 meters. <p>

<b>149:06:42</b> England: That's fine.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Charlie positions his left hand on the top of the
penetrometer and then covers that hand with his right.  He then pushes firmly on the penetrometer six times and gets a total penetration of perhaps 30 to 40 cm.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I had to really push.  It didn't go real steady.  It's
supposed to be a real steady push on that penetrometer; but you can see I pushed on it two or three times.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It's tall enough that you couldn't really lean on
it.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, that's what I was trying to do.  You see?  There's a push.  There's another push.  I was trying to get on top of it.  And then another push.  Another one.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So this is mostly arm force, rather than body
weight.&quot;]<p>

[In Octobert 2012, Journal Contributor Keith Hearn called attention to <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunar_data/soil_mech_browse.html" target="new">digitized records</a> from the penetrometers used on Apollos 15 and 16 are now available on the National Space Science Data Center website.  The <a href="A16A_SMSS_72_M016936_008.jpg" title="image" target="new">data recorded here at Station 10</a> shows that Charlie did, indeed, push on the penetrometer six times. &quot;The X (horizontal) dimension is the stress applied, and Y is the depth. Starting from the top, you can see that he pushed it down to around 7.2cm, then let up the force, resulting in the horizontal line there, then pushed down to 10.3cm and let up, and so on. And sure enough, the data shows that he did six pushes&quot;  The final depth he reached was about 22 cm.</i></blockquote>

out of the ground.  He slides the plate to the end of the
rod.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:10:23</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  Be advised I'm sorry that I'm spiking
this thing out occasionally (by using a number of discrete pushes), but
this is the only way we can do it.<p>

<b>149:10:30</b> England: That's fine, Charlie.  We see the problem.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie hops sideways toward the drill
holes.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:10:34</b> Duke: Okay, I'm moving.  I've got two more to do, cycling

Rover to the deep core site).  Right here.  Okay.  (Pause)  Okay, number
12.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie positions the penetrometer, puts both hands on the

<b><a name="1491149">149:11:49</a></b> England: Good show.  (Telling a small fib) I told them you were.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie puts his weight on the penetrometer, which slides all the way into the ground.  As it gets near full depth, Charlie loses his balance and starts rotating slowly to his right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:11:53</b> Duke: Oop!

<blockquote><i>[Charlie catches himself with his right hand and, with his
weight supported, kicks his feet around to his right to stop his
rotation.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:11:58</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>149:11:59</b> England: We see that one went all the way in.<p>

<b><a name="1491203">149:12:03</a></b> Duke: Not quite.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie sounds quite relaxed.  He gets into a push-up
position, with his weight on his hands and toes and his knees slightly off
the ground.  He pushes back but, with his knees elevated, doesn't get much
rotation at the waist and, consequently, doesn't get his center-of-gravity
behind his knees.  His rotation stops and he falls back onto his hands. 
Once his hands are on the ground, he lets himself rotate forward until his
feet are off the ground.  He then kicks his feet up, as they fall, he
pushes up with his hands.  His chest rises a meter or so off the ground
and, at that point, he tries to run forward to catch himself.  He doesn't make it and falls forward.  As his hands touch the ground again, he lets himself rotate all the way down and then pushes back, hard, and jerks his legs forward as his head and shoulders rotate up.  This maneuver gets his knees under his center-of-gravity and, finally, he is able to jump to his feet.  The entire sequence, from his first push back to the time he is on his feet takes just under 10 seconds.  He hops back until he can see the penetrometer.]<p>

[Note that Charlie has not been wearing a camera while taking the
penetrometer measurements.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You couldn't push on the penetrometer with the camera on.  It was impossible.  So I took the camera off; and that's why I was able to get up.  With the camera on, I probably wouldn't have been able to get up - without getting on a slope or without John helping.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:12:49</b> Duke: ...cycling to (drum position) 14.<p>

<b>149:12:52</b> England: Okay, Charlie.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is running toward the deep core site, sometimes loping and sometimes skipping.  The choice of stride may depend on local variations in slope.  He stops a couple of meters south of the drill.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:13:06</b> Duke: And I'm right by the double core.  I mean the deep core.<p>

<b>149:13:12</b> England: Okay.  That sounds good.<p>

Okay, but it's pretty beat up with footprints.  Should I go to a pristine
area or stay here?<p>

<b>149:13:23</b> England: Just move it over out of the footprints.

<blockquote><i>[Tony made this call on his own.  As he speaks, Lovell says that Charlie's first spot was okay.  Charlie hops forward during his next transmission.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1491327">149:13:27</a></b> Duke: Okay.  I've got a good spot.  About 2 meters toward the Central station.<p>

<b>149:13:32</b> England: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie may have moved 3 or 4 meters.  He is now north of the drill and positions the penetrometer.  As he pushes on it, it begins to slide into the ground, albeit not as quickly as at the previous spot.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:13:48</b> Duke: That one's going all the way in, too.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie may be using less force as he feels the
penetrometer slide into the ground, trying not to fall forward this
time.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:13:51</b> Duke: If I didn't lose my balance.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie winds up on his knees, with his PLSS far enough back that his center-of gravity is over his knees.  From that position, he should be able to lean back slightly and then stand.  However, Charlie has not become proficient at this maneuver.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:13:54</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>149:13:56</b> Duke: Bet I can't get up.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie leans back until the bottom of his PLSS is touching his heels.  He is unsure he'll be able to get up from that position but, after a few seconds, decides to give it a try.  He uses his leg muscles to push his torso up and as he rises, kicks his feet forward under his body.  On Earth, the maneuver would be very difficult.  On the Moon, it is relatively easy and was used on numerous occasions by the Apollo 17 crew.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:14:33</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, (with regard to) that (heat flow) connector, the printed circuit on the heat flow is still in.<p>

<b>149:14:40</b> England: Okay.  We understand.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie positions the penetrometer and puts his hands on the top.  He applies steady pressure and the penetrometer sinks a few centimeters into the surface.

<b>149:18:46</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  I collected one sample, which was a sharp, angular (rock).

<b>149:18:57</b> England: Okay.  And we're going to have to pack up and head home.<p>

<b>149:19:03</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>149:19:06</b> Duke: Home is about 50 meters away.

<b>149:19:12</b> Young: Can you put this back there, Charlie?<p>

<b>149:19:13</b> Duke: Yeah.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is probably asking Charlie to stow the tongs on the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:19:18</b> Duke: There, I thought we had lost this rake here for a minute, but there it is.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie had taken the rake off the extension handle so he could assemble the double core and, here, it has taken a minute for him to find it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:19:26</b> Young: And that sample is going in bag sample 381, and I'll shoot the pan here in a second.<p>

<b>149:19:30</b> England: Okay, 381.  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1491942">149:19:42</a></b> Young: And it was a black rock; but I don't think it was vesicular basalt.  I think it was a breccia.<p>

<b>149:19:48</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>149:19:49</b> Young: In a lot of ways, it's the same type as we've been sampling it.  Going into sample bag (means SCB-)4 on top of the sample (means Station) 9 samples.

<blockquote><i>[John goes off-camera to the right.  Fendell is still
looking at the LM.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:20:03</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  I'm up to frame count 91 on magazine Delta.<p>

<b>149:20:08</b> England: Okay; we copy, Charlie.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:20:14</b> Duke: Tony, does the...I can't remember.  Does the <a
href="../tools/judy76.gif" title="image" target="new">CSVC</a> (Core Sample Vacuum Container) go into
the rock box?<p>

<b>149:20:26</b> England: Yes, it does.<p>

<b>149:20:30</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell has pulled back on the zoom and, now, the LM covers
only about 20 percent of the height of the image.]</i></blockquote>

<p>

<b>149:21:21</b> England: Okay.  And, John, when you get inside (means
&quot;get seated&quot;), we have a (switch/circuit breaker) configuration
change in LRV.<p>

<b>149:21:28</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  Charlie's already back at the
LM.<p>

<b>149:21:39</b> England: Rog.  We saw that before you went off (the air,
meaning before John switched off the TV.)<p>

<b>149:21:40</b> Young: He walks a lot faster than I do.  (Pause)  Okay. 
Talk with the (<a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">console</a>) configuration change.<p>

<b>149:21:50</b> England: Okay.  Except for the PWM Select and the Drive
Enables, we would like everything back to nominal.  Circuit breakers in;
and Drive Power on Bus Delta.  (Also),  Steering on Bus Delta.  (Pause) 
That's Rear Steering.<p>

<b><a name="1492206">149:22:06</a></b> Young: Circuit breakers are in,

reset (the nav) before you came.<p>

<b>149:22:20</b> Duke: Tony, looking back up...(Stops to listen)  Yeah, I
did that. <p>
