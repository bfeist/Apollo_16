<blockquote><i>[The EVA started at about <a
href="a16.eva2prep.html#1423925" target="new">142:39:25</a> and, consequently, the elapsed time is about 6 hours 43 minutes.  The Apollo 15 record was 7 hours 12 minutes.  John and Charlie will get the record if they start cabin repress after about 149:52.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:22:44</b> Duke: Okay.  Tony, do we put as many core tubes as we can in the rock box also?<p>

<b>149:22:53</b> England: We'll work that, Charlie.<p>

<b>149:22:56</b> Young: Boy, the speed....<p>

<b>149:22:58</b> Duke: How about the core tubes, do we put all the core tubes in the rock box also?.<p>

<b>149:23:06</b> England: Okay.  Charlie, we can put four...<p>

<b>149:23:08</b> Young: Looks like the bearing (indicator) is working
okay.<p>

<b>149:23:09</b> England: ...core tubes plus the CSVC in the rock box and
then plus what documented samples you can get in there.<p>

<b>149:23:16</b> Duke: Okay;  four core tube, CSVC, documented sample,
gotcha.<p>

<b>149:23:20</b> England: Rog.<p>

<b>149:23:21</b> Duke: Okay.  Looking back towards Stone Mountain,
Tony...<p>

<b>149:23:24</b> Young: Charlie, let me park the LM right there.<p>

<b>149:23:26</b> Duke: Okay.  The LM is already parked; but you sure can
park the Rover.<p>

<b>149:23:30</b> Young: All right.  Fair enough.<p>

<b>149:23:32</b> Duke: Okay.  Looking back towards Stone Mountain, Tony, I
don't see the Rover tracks.

<blockquote><i>[Although there is no mention of looking for Rover tracks on
the mountain, this is probably something Charlie was curious about before
the mission.  The human eye can be a lot better than the Hasselblads in
picking out detail at a distance.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:23:42</b> England: Okay.  That's fine.  We're a little bit behind
the timeline there, Charlie.  I think we better get closed out.<p>

<b>149:23:50</b> Duke: Okay, we're doing that right now, as fast as we can.<p>

<b>149:23:52</b> England: Okay.  I understand.

<b>149:23:55</b> Duke: John's back at the...John's at the Rover (means LM).

I'm going to put you on (<a href="../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="new">LCRU Mode switch</a> position) 3 (FM/TV).  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:24:08</b> Young: Okay, 3.  LRV powerdown...(Burst of static)...(As per <a href="a16eva2CDR20-21.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-21</a>, I have to) reset the Far UV, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[The UV camera has been taking data from a single
field-of-view - just above the summit of Stone Mountain - ever since John
last reset it at <a href="a16.eva2prelim.html#1432303"
target="new">143:23:03</a>, just before he and Charlie started the drive to
Station 4.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1492421">149:24:21</a></b> England: And, John, as you get off
the Rover, we'd like you to take a picture of the UV camera; it should be
about f/5.6 at 250.<p>

<b>149:24:36</b> Young: Roger.<p>

<b>149:24:40</b> England: You don't have to go up to it.<p>

<b>149:24:42</b> Young: From the Rover you want me to take that picture?<p>

<b>149:24:43</b> England: Yeah, just take it anywhere.  As long as we can
see that location, that's all we're looking for.<p>

<b>149:24:50</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>149:24:53</b> Duke: Okay, you're aligned, Tony, with signal strength about 4.<p>

<b>149:24:55</b> England: Okay, we got a good picture.

<blockquote><i>[<a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> is looking toward the block-covered ridge SSW of the LM.  He pans clockwise.  John parked the Rover on a northeasterly heading at the MESA.  If he has followed the procedures on <a href="a16eva2CDR20-21.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-21</a>, his
heading is 351.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:24:56</b> Duke: TV Remote.  (Hearing Tony)  Okay.<p>

<b>149:25:03</b> Young: (Wondering if f/5.6 is the right Hasselblad setting) Actually, just the normal old thing ought to catch it, Houston; because it's not in Sun but there sure is a lot of Sun behind it and on it and all that.  Very strange.  It's in shadow.

<blockquote><i>[As shown in the camera decals in Figure <a href="a16.lsp449.jpg" title="image" target="new">5.3-2</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, f/5.6 was normally used for up-Sun photos taken with either color (HCEX) or black-and-white (HBW) film.]<p>

[Journal Contributor Markus Mehring notes &quot;'HCEX' is a cryptic acronym for </i>the<i> Apollo standard color film emulsion, used both in the Hasselblads ('HCEX') and the 16-mm Maurer cameras ('CEX'). Its full name is 'Ektachrome MS Film, Type SO 368 (19 DIN, 64 ASA)', and amateur and professional photographers worldwide know it as 'Ektachrome X' - hence the 'EX'.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell pans past Charlie, who may be dusting the front of the
Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:25:20</b> England: Okay.  I guess they wanted to see into the shadow
a little bit.<p>

<b>149:25:23</b> Young: (Garbled) that?  (Stops to listen)  Okay.  Well, I
mean the leg...the shadows...You'll be able to see it fine.

<blockquote><i>[John takes three pictures of the UV Camera, AS16-114-
<a href="images16.html#18468" target="new">18468</a>, 
<a href="images16.html#18469" target="new">18469</a>, and 
<a href="images16.html#18470" target="new">18470</a>.  Neither he nor Charlie take any more pictures during this EVA.]<p>

[Charlie goes off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:25:36</b> Young: Okay.  Houston, you want to Reset (the UV camera)?<p>

<b>149:25:38</b> England: Roger.  Reset and I have new setting. <p>

<b>149:25:44</b> Young: Okay.  Let me watch the wheels go around.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:25:53</b> Young: Reset; and it did work.  It's working. <p>

<b>149:25:57</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>149:25:58</b> Young: And what are the new settings, Houston? <p>

<b>149:26:02</b> England: Azimuth, 326.<p>

<b>149:26:05</b> Young: 326.<p>

<b>149:26:06</b> England: And elevation, 16.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:26:18</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie, who is visible beyond the LMP seat
as he packs the rock box at the MESA.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:26:25</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, I'm putting core tubes 29 (pause) 43
(pause) 45, and 54 in the rock box.<p>

<b>149:26:44</b> England: Okay.  We copy that.<p>

<b>149:26:49</b> Duke: CSVC is in the rock box.  Packing it right now. <p>

<b>149:26:53</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans up to look at the Ascent Stage.  In Houston,
Flight tells EVA (the person responsible for keeping track of the timeline
and planned activities) that he thinks John has parked on the wrong
heading.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:26:56</b> Duke: You want an unbagged rock in the rock box, Tony?  I
don't think you do.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is saying that there is an unbagged rock in SCB-2
and wants to know if it should go into the rock box along with the bagged
samples and core tubes.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:27:03</b> Young: Okay, a 326, and what's the elevation, Houston. <p>

<b>149:27:06</b> England: Sixteen.<p>

<b>149:27:10</b> Young: Sixteen.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has probably put the unbagged rock aside on the
MESA and now takes the empty SCB to the Rover.  He tosses it in his foot
pan and reaches under his seat to get another SCB.  He pauses a moment,
possibly to look at his checklist and then bangs the bag against the seat
frame, possibly in an effort to get the top open.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:27:27</b> Young: Okay, Houston, 326 and 16.  (Pause) That's set and
she's going.<p>

<b>149:27:37</b> England: Okay.  Charlie, yeah, you can put unbagged rocks
in the SRC.<p>

<b>149:27:43</b> Duke: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stands the SCB upright in his footpan, gets a core
tube out of his seat pan and inserts it into a stowage sleeve in the SCB. 
During the following conversation, he reaches across the Rover and gets
something - possibly a sample - out of John's seat pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:28:06</b> Young: Got the hammer, Charlie?<p>

<b>149:28:08</b> Duke: It's in the thing here.<p>

<b>149:28:10</b> Young: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>149:28:11</b> Duke: The seat.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:28:18</b> Young: I think this bag here has got so little in it we
can...<p>

<b>149:28:20</b> Duke: Let's empty it into the SRC;  some more will go in
the SRC.<p>

<b>149:28:23</b> Young: Well, okay.  But this has got those two
whatchacallems there.<p>

<b>149:28:27</b> Duke: What you mean?<p>

<b>149:28:29</b> Young: (Garbled)<p>

<b>149:28:29</b> Duke: Oh, those - Yeah;  okay.  They can't go in the
SRC.<p>

<b>149:28:32</b> Young: Where do they go, in the ETB?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes the SCB to the MESA.  Its top is now open.  Fendell pans right and finds John at the CDR seat.  He is working with an SCB that appears to have little, if anything, in it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:28:36</b> Duke: Ah, no; in a rock bag somewhere.  Why don't you put them back here in mine, John.  It's back on the Rover here.<p>

<b>149:28:44</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>149:28:46</b> Duke: Back on the Rover.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John turns the SCB upside down, takes the bottom in his left hand and shakes it to get something out.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:28:59</b> Young: There you go.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John takes the SCB to the back of the Rover.  He then
appears to attach the SCB to the tool carrier.  Fendell pans left to watch
Charlie at the MESA.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:29:26</b> Duke: We're packing up the rock box, Tony. <p>

<b>149:29:29</b> England: Okay, good.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has removed the <a
href="../tools/judy74.jpg" title="image" target="new">Beta-cloth protector</a>, which was covering the seals on the
rock box, and discards it to his left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:29:30</b> Duke: Got the rocks in it.  The liner's coming off.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie removes the Teflon 
&quot;<a href="../tools/judy71.jpg" title="image" target="new">spacer</a>&quot; from the rock box and tosses it off-camera to his left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:29:37</b> Duke: And I put the other core tubes in a...Tell you in a
minute.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie closes the top of the rock box and latches
it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:29:49</b> Young: (Still attaching the SCB to the back of the Rover) 
Beautiful, they just fit right in the top.<p>

<b>149:29:52</b> Duke: Good.  What's the number on that one, John?<p>

<b>149:29:56</b> Young: That's SCB-2.  No.  Yeah, 1.<p>

<b><a name="1493002">149:30:02</a></b> Duke: Okay, and John's crystalline
rock and the two other core tubes go in (SCB) number 3, Tony.<p>

<b>149:30:14</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John goes to the LMP seat.  He doesn't appear to be carrying anything so, whatever it was he shook out of the SCB, it probably wasn't a sample.  John is probably looking in the seat pans to make sure they haven't overlooked any samples.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:30:17</b> Duke: John, have you got...Where'd those two core tubes go that you had?<p>

<b>149:30:20</b> Young: I put them in here.  Four and forty-five are in your seat (lost under Charlie).<p>

<b>149:30:23</b> Duke: Oh, okay, then I got them already. <p>

<b>149:30:25</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes off-camera to the right, probably carrying the
SCB so he can pack the film magazines in it as per <a href="a16eva2LMP-22.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-22</a>.  John goes around the back of the Rover and joins Charlie off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:30:30</b> Duke: (Reading <a href="a16eva2LMP-22.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-22</a>) Okay, my DAC (magazine) goes...<p>

<b>149:30:32</b> Young: Here, let me unload your backpack.<p>

<b>149:30:37</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>149:30:38</b> Young: My backpack's already been unloaded.<p>

<b>149:30:41</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John is referring to the fact that his SCB fell off,
probably while he climbed on the Rover at Station 9, and then wedged
between the fender and the frame of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:30:44</b> Young: We got two bags out that we...<p>

<b>149:30:45</b> Duke: Yeah, extra.<p>

<b>149:30:47</b> Young :  Well, good.

<blockquote><i>[John probably means that they have two unused SCBs which

they previously unstowed from the MESA.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:30:50</b> Duke: Okay, we're going to have three...I don't know how
full mine is.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:31:00</b> Young: Okay, I got it.  (Pause)  (Garbled) (Pause)<p>

<b>149:31:15</b> Duke: Got it.<p>

<b>149:31:17</b> Young: That's got it.  Okay.<p>

<b>149:31:20</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>149:31:21</b> Young: It's hardly got any rocks in it at all.<p>

<b>149:31:22</b> Duke: I know.  I think I can stuff them in this other bag
(meaning SCB-3) over here, John.<p>

<b>149:31:26</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Most of the rocks they collected went into John's SCB.]<p>

[Fendell starts a counter-clockwise pan.  In Houston, Flight is having
a discussion with Experiments, who are pointing out that, at this point,
SCB-3 is supposed to be empty and under the LMP seat for use during EVA-3.  At <a href="#1493002" target="new">149:30:02</a>, they heard Charlie say that he was putting some full core tubes and John's crystalline rock in SCB-3 and, by inference, that he was planning to take it up to the cabin.  Tony joins the SCB discussion in Houston.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:31:27</b> Young: I'll take SCB-1 and put it by the footpad,
Charlie.<p>

<b>149:31:32</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  Yeah, I can stuff them (meaning the samples that were in Charlie's SCB) in here (meaning SCB-3).<p>

<b>149:31:36</b> Young: Let me get these core tube caps out of here.  Out
of (SCB-)1 and put them under the seat pan.  (Pause)  Okay.  (Pause)  I'll
put them on the HTC, how would that be?<p>

<b>149:31:58</b> Young: That's fine, that cap (dispenser) is empty. 
(Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1493204">149:32:04</a></b> England: Okay, Charlie, you called out that you put two
core tubes and John's crystalline rocks in SCB-3; that should have some
empty core tubes and core caps in it (that are planned for use during
EVA-3).  Could you straighten that out?<p>

<b>149:32:18</b> Duke: No, we...It had two core tubes empty that we used. 
We used the bag, Tony, that's true...<p>

<b>149:32:27</b> Young: (Garbled), Charlie.<p>

<b>149:32:28</b> Duke: Excuse me, John.  (To Tony)  That was set...<p>

<b>149:32:29</b> Young: (Lost under Charlie)<p>

<b>149:32:30</b> Duke: ...for EVA-l...(Correcting himself) I mean
EVA-3...(Stops to think)<p>

<b>149:32:40</b> England: There's no problem as long as you took those core tubes and core caps out.<p>

<b>149:32:46</b> Duke: We don't...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>149:32:47</b> Duke: Well, we got the core caps out, but we didn't get the core tubes out and I don't know whether...We must have used them!

<blockquote><i>[Part way through his pan, Fendell raised his aim and continued turning the TV until he found the high-gain antenna on the front of the Rover.  He then raised his aim some more and is now looking at Earth.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:32:57</b> Young: This here has a couple of core caps in it too, Charlie; in (SCB) number 1.<p>

<b>149:33:00</b> Duke: How about core tubes?<p>

<b>149:33:02</b> Young: (Garbled, possibly &quot;Glad they asked&quot;); a couple of core tubes in number 1.<p>

<b>149:33:03</b> Duke: Oh, good, okay, we'll take those out. <p>

<b>149:33:05</b> Young: Are they empty?<p>

<b>149:33:06</b> Duke: Yeah.  They're empty.  Okay, put them under my seat.<p>

<b>149:33:09</b> Young: Sure they're empty?<p>

<b>149:33:10</b> Duke: Yeah, I'm positive, unless they got a cap on, they're empty.  Okay, Tony, we found them.<p>

<b>149:33:15</b> England: Okay, good show.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell has zoomed in on Earth.  At maximum zoom, the apparent diameter of Earth  - which is two degrees - is equivalent to about one third of the vertical height of the TV field-of view.  About one quarter of the Moon-facing hemisphere is sunlit.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:34:29</b> Young: Okay, now you're going to have to change that some because we got a little more than two HDCs, right?.

<blockquote><i>[They have probably dropped the glass ball.  Bailey and Ulrich, in &quot;Apollo 16 Voice Transcript Pertaining to the geology of the landing site&quot; identify this sample as 65016, while, in the caption to Figure 45 of the Professional Paper, sample 65016 is identified as a Station 5 sample, probably the one John examined at <a href="a16.sta5.html#1452052" target="new">145:20:52</a>.  Readers should note that Bailey and Ulrich don't really make a clear decision about 65016; specifically, they identify 65016 as BOTH the 145:20:52 specimen and the glass ball the crew is collecting here at the LM.  However, in the Station
5 TV coverage, we can clearly see John drop the 145:20:52 specimen and,
therefore, I am inclined to believe that 65016 is the glass ball they have
just dropped.]</i></blockquote>

training article that everybody used; and it was just old, and the stuff
was in racks and everything got out of align and it would get twisted a
little bit and you couldn't get it out and it'd stick and they did whatever
they did to it - graphited it.  So it was frustrating.  So, when it worked

elevation was about 28 degrees.  Because of the landing delay and the
decision to have a rest period before doing EVA-1, the Sun's elevation is
currently about 38 degrees.  The LM shadow is only about 9 meters long.

was about 26 meters long.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:49:43</b> Young: Okay, Houston, you want to Reset the UV camera?<p>

<b>149:49:47</b> England: Yep.  We got a setting.<p>

<b>149:49:52</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>149:49:53</b> England: Okay, it's azimuth, 100; and elevation, 77.<p>

<b>149:50:01</b> Young: Okay.  Going to Reset.  That wheel's moved more
than 180?<p>

<b>149:50:12</b> England: That may look pretty close to the LM, but we'll
just take it the way it is.<p>

<b>149:50:19</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>149:50:30</b> Duke: It's going to be pointing right at the LM,
Houston!<p>

<b>149:50:32</b> England: Elevation is 77.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's breathing is audible as he crawls into the
cabin.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:50:34</b> Young: All right.  Maybe it'll be over the top of it. 
(Hears Tony)  Okay.  Azimuth, 100; elevation, 77.<p>

<b>149:50:55</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, I'm inside.<p>

<b>149:50:57</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>149:51:00</b> Young: Standing up, Charlie?<p>

<b>149:51:01</b> Duke: Yeah.  And I got about a ton of dirt from somewhere.

(Pause)<p>

<b>149:51:10</b> Young: (To Tony) Okay, elevation, 100...(Correcting
himself)  Azimuth, 100; elevation, 77, set and pointed.  It misses the LM
okay.  That's straight overhead.  (Lost under Tony) <p>

<b>149:51:19</b> England: Okay.  Good show.  You're looking at the
geo-corona.<p>

<b>149:51:25</b> Young: Oh, the geo-corona.  Hopefully.  (Long Pause) 
Charlie, are you standing up?<p>

<b>149:51:44</b> Duke: Yeah, I'm standing up.<p>

<b>149:51:46</b> Young: You ready for a rock box?<p>

<b>149:51:48</b> Duke: Uh...Yeah.  I'd like to get this pallet (unstowed). 
You can start on up.<p>

<b>149:52:02</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:52:09</b> England: And, John, have you closed the circuit breakers
on the LRV?<p>

<b>149:52:15</b> Young: That's affirmative.<p>

<b>149:52:16</b> England: Okay.  Fine.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John has forgotten to give Houston the readouts they
requested.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:52:26</b> Young: What happens to it if you don't pull those
breakers?  (Does it) run off somewhere?  (Long Pause)  Okay, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[The following dialog indicates that, at this point, Charlie
tosses something small out through the hatch.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:53:07</b> Young: Uh-uh, Charlie.<p>

<b>149:53:08</b> Duke: What?<p>

<b>149:53:11</b> Young: You're too near the (UV) camera to be slinging
stuff out there. <p>

<b>149:53:13</b> Duke: Oh, I'm sorry.  It's just that one little old dinky
thing.  That's all I was going to do.<p>

<b>149:53:15</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>149:53:16</b> Duke: Okay, here comes the (empty) pallet to you.<p>

<b>149:53:25</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>149:53:26</b> Duke: Got it?<p>

<b>149:53:27</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>149:53:28</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>149:53:35</b> Young: I'm going to throw it by the...<p>

<b>149:53:39</b> Duke: Okay, babe, you got two SCBs and an ETB to come up. 
You could probably load the...<p>

<b>149:53:45</b> Young: There the SRC right there, Charlie.<p>

<b>149:53:47</b> Duke: I know it.  Well, you still got two ETBs (means
SCBs).<p>

<b>149:53:50</b> Young: Two ETBs?<p>

<b>149:53:52</b> Duke: Yeah.  I mean one ETB and the...(Pause)  The two
SCBs.<p>

<b>149:54:05</b> Young: Right.<p>

<b><a name="1495406">149:54:06</a></b> Duke: You might put one SCB on that ETB line.  It's real
light.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[From the porch, John will use the lanyard to haul up the
ETB.]<p>

     [Duke - &quot;(I was suggesting that he) just put the SCB on top of
the ETB with the handles, I believe, and it would just come on up, I
think.&quot;]<p>

     [The following dialog suggests that the next thing John does is to
haul up the ETB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:54:17</b> Young: (Passing in the ETB) Okay, here you go, Charlie.<p>

<b>149:54:20</b> Duke: Pass her in.  (Pause)  Okay.  (Pause)  I should have
unhooked it.  I got it.

<blockquote><i>[Apparently, John didn't detach the lanyard before passing
in the ETB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:54:31</b> Young: You want me to unhook it?<p>

<b>149:54:32</b> Duke: Well, I got it now.<p>

<b>149:54:33</b> Young: Okay, don't lock the hook.  Just unhook it.<p>

<b>149:54:36</b> Duke: I'm not.  It's alright.  (Pause)  Okay, there it
comes.<p>

<b>149:54:53</b> Young: Okay, I got the hook.<p>

<b>149:54:57</b> Duke: Okay, two SCBs and we got it.<p>

<b>149:54:58</b> England: Okay, John...(Correcting himself)  Charlie. 
Sounds good.<p>

<b>149:55:09</b> Duke: John, you're not going to believe the dirt on this
floor.<p>

<b>149:55:11</b> Young: Yeah, I am.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John probably goes down the ladder at this point to get the
SCBs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:55:52</b> Duke: What are you doing?<p>

<b>149:55:54</b> Young: Oh, I'm trying to set something up here.<p>

<b>149:55:59</b> Duke: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John may be adjusting the lanyard or, quite simply, he may
be dawdling to make sure he and Charlie surpass the Apollo 15 EVA
record.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:56:40</b> Duke: No.<p>

<b>149:56:41</b> Young: You didn't?<p>

<b>149:56:42</b> Duke: No.  (Burst of static; Long Pause)  (Deadpan) Maybe
we've got visitors.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John brings up the first of the SCBs and tries to put it
into the cabin far enough that Charlie can bend down and grab
it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:57:30</b> Duke: I got it.<p>

<b>149:57:31</b> Young: Got it?<p>

<b>149:57:32</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>149:57:33</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>149:57:34</b> Duke: Yeah.  How do you read, Houston?<p>

<b>149:57:37</b> England: We're copying you, Charlie.<p>

<b>149:57:42</b> Duke: Okay.  I just heard a little squeal back there (and)
I was curious.<p>

<b>149:57:48</b> England: All right.  We had a (site) hand-off.<p>

<b>149:57:53</b> Young: Ah so.  (Pause)

come through the Goldstone station in California.]</i></blockquote>

<b>149:58:01</b> Duke: These bags come open...The SCBs come open when you
don't want them to and you can't get them open when you want them to.<p>

<b>149:58:11</b> England: Okay.  We'll call that Charlie's Law.<p>

<b>149:58:16</b> Duke: Yeah.  (Pause)

can go wrong, it will.&quot; and its many corollaries.  My favorite is

now passing it in.]</i></blockquote>

slide it.<p>

<b>149:58:36</b> Young: Got it?<p>

<b>149:58:37</b> Duke: Okay, now let me get behind the hatch. <p>

<b>149:58:38</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)

turn off their PLSS feedwater before they close the

legs...There we go.  Okay.  PLSS...Okay, wait a minute.<p>

<b>149:59:59</b> Young: (Garbled) are open, Charlie.<p>
