<b>169:17:26</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>169:17:29</b> England: ...And after that, we'll go on with a rake soil at this site.<p>

<b>169:17:40</b> Young: Charlie, where is the Earth?  Should be right straight up.<p>

<b>169:18:01</b> Young: There we go.<p>

<b>169:18:37</b> England: Okay.  And when you're on the console (<a href="AS16-0078-NOID-FlightUnit.jpg" title="image" target="new">6 Mb</a>) there, could you tap that Amp-Hour meter and see if you can get that lower one to come up some?<p>

<b>169:18:50</b> Duke: I banged the control panel hard, Tony, and none of the meters changed.

<blockquote><i>[The TV image jiggles, perhaps as John tries to free the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">dustbrush</a> from its holder on the front of the Rover.  A <a href="a16brush.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> from training photo <a href="images16.html#KSC71PC777" target="new">KSC-71PC-777</a> shows the stowed dustbrush.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:18:56</b> Young: Uh-oh.<p>

<b>169:18:57</b> England: (Responding to Charlie)  Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Apparently, John has dropped the dust brush.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1691900">169:19:00</a></b> Duke: What happened, John?  (Pause)  Let me get the brush ...(Static)

<blockquote><i>[TV off.  As Charlie implies at 169:19:22, John has probably bumped against the high-gain antenna, knocking it out of alignment.]<p>

[I do not believe that Charlie comes over to help John at this point.  As he says in a moment, he is taking his pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:19:12</b> Young: (Do) you believe that?<p>

<b>169:19:14</b> Duke: The one in training never would stay on.<p>

<b>169:19:21</b> Young: Agh.  Okay.<p>

<b>169:19:22</b> Duke: Okay, you moved the (high-gain) antenna, John.  (Pause)<p>

<b>169:19:30</b> England: All right.  We lost our picture.<p>

<b>169:19:34</b> Young: (Garbled)<p>

<b><a name="1691942">169:19:42</b> Duke: Okay.  Just a minute.  I'm halfway through a pan here.  It'll take me 2 seconds.  (Pause)<p>

<blockquote><i>[Journal Contributor Jim Murray has combined frames 18816 and 18818 and has largely removed the effects of sunlight reflected in the lens to produce a <a href="a16mini18816-8.jpg" title="image" target="new">striking up-Sun view of John at the Rover with the LM in the background</a>.]<p>

[Journal Contributor Dominique Caudron notes that Charlie caught Venus just over the eastern horizon in <a href="images16.html#18815" target="new">18815, 16, and 17</a>. Journal Contributor Yuri Krasilnikov has created an <a href="A16yk18815-17.gif" "title="three-frame movie" target="new">animation</a> from details from the three frames.  At the time Charlie took the pan, about 1914 GMT/UTC on 23 April 1972, the Sun's azimuth and elevation were 77.8 and 47.2 degress, respectively and Venus's were 84.4 and 2.9 degrees.  Venus's apparent magnitude was -4.4.  A <a href="a16vert18815.jpg" title="image detail" target="new">vertical slice</a> thru the photo shows shadow orientations in the foreground.  Venus rose at the Descartes site at about 164:05, about an hour and a half before the start of EVA-3.  However, Charlie's Station 10 Prime Pan is the first sequence of EVA-3 photos in which Venus is not hidden by the LM or high ground on the eastern horizon.  Venus was also captured in a number of <a href="../a14/a14Venus.html" target="new">images taken by Al Shepard</a> during Apollo 14.</i></blockquote>

<b>169:19:56</b> Duke: Okay.  Here I come.  No, you've got it pointed up too straight.  (Pause)  Okay.  It needs to come left; left; more left; more, more; okay.  (Static fades) Now down just a skosh.  That's it...Now left.<p>

<b>169:20:23</b> Young: That's beautiful.<p>

<b>169:20:24</b> Duke: Okay.<p>


<b>169:20:26</b> Young: It (meaning the image of Earth in the sighting scope)'s very dim 'til it gets near the center.

<blockquote><i>[TV on.  The TV camera is now pointed north-northeast, over the left-rear Rover wheel.  John may have moved the camera when he was re-aligning the antenna.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:20:33</b> Young: (I'm) such a shrimp, I can't get my head up in there.<p>

<b>169:20:35</b> Duke: Tony, a double core here, too?<p>

<b>169:20:37</b> England: Right.  We'll need a double core.

<blockquote><i>[<a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pans right and, almost immediately, the LM comes into view.  We see a darkened trail leading toward the LM, a trail that Charlie made when he ran from Station 10 to the LM at the end of EVA-2 at <a href="a16.sta10.html#1492040" target="new">149:20:40</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:20:42</b> Duke: You cut out.  Say again?<p>

<b>169:20:44</b> England: Yes, we would like a double core...<p>

<b>169:20:48</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>169:20:48</b> England: The rake soil is first priority and then the double core.<p>

<b>169:20:52</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1692059">169:20:59</a></b> Young: (To Houston) (I'll) get your eyeball there.

<blockquote><i>[John dusts the TV lens.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:21:01</b> Duke: (Puzzled as to what John meant) Huh?  (Laughing) Oh!<p>

<b>169:21:05</b> Young: Okay.  The Velcro on the side...The glue on the Velcro on the (TV) sunshield is...Whatever it does.  It's probably the same glue you used on the padded bags, because they came loose, too.<p>

<b>169:21:20</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell continues the clockwise pan.]<p>

[Charlie captured the sunshield in a number of traverse photos, such as AS16-106-<a href="images16.html#17381" target="new">17381</a>, taken during the approach to Station 13 and, more clearly, in a <a href="a16det18752.jpg" title="image detail" target="new">detail</a> from AS16-117-<a href="images16.html#18752" target="new">18752</a>, taken during the drive onward to Station 10-Prime.  A close-up photo from the right front of the publically-displayed <a href="../79-832_640LRV Qual.jpg" title="image" target="new">Qualification Unit</a> at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum shows attachment Velcro on the top of the barrel and  surrounding the lens ( <a href="../lrvtv2.jpg" title="image" target="new">1.6 Mb</a> or  <a href="../lrvtv2sm.jpg" title="image" target="new">0.4 Mb</a> ).

In both photos, note the control tabs for 'IRIS' and 'ZOOM'.  In 17381 (linked above), the 'ZOOM' tab is clearly visible.  Photos courtesy Allan Needell, Air and Space Museum.  A <a href="../SCHLRV1sunshield.jpg" title="image detail" target="new">detail</a> from a <a href="../SCHLRV1.jpg" title="image" target="new">photograph of a Training Unit</a> on public display at Space Center Houston shows an attached sunshield from the top.  A Velcro strap is attached to the top of the sunshield and then to the top of the lens barrel.  Photo by Mike Gentry, NASA Johnson, who has also provided a <a href="../SCHLRV2.jpg" title="image" target="new">second view</a>.]<p>

[Finally, Ulli Lotzmann has provided a relevant extract from the NASA document &quot;AP16 Problem and Discrepancy List&quot;, dated 26 June 1972:  &quot;The sun shade is secured in place by Velcro hooks on the sun shade and Velcro pile on the camera. The Velcro pile is sewn in place on the television blanket. The Velcro hooks are held to the sun shade with an adhesive. A discrepancy report was written during qualification testing of the sun shade because the adhesive would not hold during pull test.
Lunar surface photographs verified separation occurred between the sunshade and Velcro cemented to the sunshade. For Apollo 17 it is directed that stiching or brads be added to prevent this occurence&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:21:21</b> Young: You want this sunshield on there, or do you want us to take it off and throw it away?<p>

<b>169:21:25</b> England: Well, if it's doing any good at all, let's just leave it on.  It doesn't seem to be in the picture.<p>

<b>169:21:32</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)  Okay, I'm gonna put the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">dustbrush</a> under my seat.  I don't want to go through that again.

<blockquote><i>[John doesn't tell us if he actually removed the sunshield and saw that the Velcro adhesive had failed or if the sunshield was merely loose.  The fact that Charlie dropped the sunshield into the dust at <a href="a16.lrvload.html#1201819" target="new">120:18:19</a>, just prior to installing it on the camera, may be relevant. This incident is not discussed in the Apollo 16 Mission Report.]<p>

[After John parks the Rover at the VIP site, at <a href="a16.vip.html#1703052" target="new">170:30:52</a> Tony asks him to remove the sunshield and throw it away.]<p>

[The ALSEP Central Station comes into view.  Stone Mountain is in the background.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:21:58</b> Duke: Oh, rats!  I dropped the (gnomon)...<p>

<b>169:22:02</b> Young: I'll come help you, Charlie.<p>

<b>169:22:03</b> Duke: Dropped the gnomon right where I wanted to sample.  (Pause)  There we go.  (Doing his W.C. <a href="a16_wcfields.html" target="new">Fields</a> voice)  Ah, the big eye is looking the wrong way.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell is now centered on the 2-meter boulder.  Note the foreground Rover track.  Here, we can see the edges on the shallow impression made by the Rover wheels.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:22:18</b> Duke: Okay.  Boy, I just can't see anything when I get this camera in my shadow.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is trying to read his camera settings to take &quot;before&quot; photos of the rake site but, because he is already in position to take a down-Sun and is facing west, the camera is in his own shadow.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:22:24</b> Young: That's a good place (to sample), Charlie.<p>

<b><a name="1692229">169:22:29</a></b> Duke: There's the &quot;down-Sun&quot;.

<blockquote><i>[During the following transmission, Charlie changes his camera settings because, after taking the down-Sun, he is about to take a cross-Sun &quot;locator&quot; of the Rover.  As shown in the &quot;Standard Sampling Photos&quot; part of Figure <a href="a16.lsp192.jpg" title="image" target="new">3.3-1</a> in the Apollo 16 Final Lunar Surface Procedures, the down-Suns were taken at f/11 and the cross-Suns were taken at f/8.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:22:31</b> Duke:  f/4; f/8 for the cross-Sun.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's down-Sun is  AS16-117-
<a href="images16.html#18824" target="new">18824</a>.]<p>

[John's cross-Sun stereopair from the south is AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18681" target="new">18681</a>and 
<a href="images16.html#18682" target="new">18682</a>.]<p>

[Charlie's &quot;locator&quot; of the Rover is AS16-117-
<a href="images16.html#18825" target="new">18825</a>, which is also an excellent picture of John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:22:36</b> Duke: How long is this stop, Tony?<p>

<b>169:22:38</b> England: Okay.  This is a 30-minute stop.<p>

<b>169:22:43</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  Home again, home again!  (Pause)  Look at that regolith.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As Fendell continues to pan, John and Charlie come into view northwest of the Rover.  John has his back to us and is undoubtedly holding a sample bag open.  Charlie is standing north of him and has the rake head up at waist height.  He is examining the fruits of his first swath.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:22:11</b> Duke: We've got some glass-coated frags here, Tony...<p>

<b>169:23:13</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>169:23:14</b> Duke: ...in the rake.  I don't see anything that looks like (basalt)...<p>

<b>169:23:19</b> Young: Get another...<p>

<b>169:23:20</b> Duke: Okay.  That was about a half a bagful (in) one scoop (meaning one rake swath).  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie pours the samples into the bag.  Fendell continues the TV pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:23:30</b> Young: Bag's full.  All right.<p>

<b>169:23:33</b> Duke: Uh-oh!  Uh-oh!  (To Houston) Okay, Tony.  Out of that scoop, we lost the two biggest rocks.  I poured too fast.<p>

<b>169:23:46</b> Young: I didn't bag fast enough, Charlie.  (Pause)<p>

<b>169:23:53</b> Duke: They just don't stop in this gravity field once they get moving.  Okay.  There we go, John.<p>

<b>169:24:01</b> Young: (Will you) hold the bags for a second?<p>

<b>169:24:03</b> Duke: Yeah.  I got bags on my camera here we could have used.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[They have been having trouble with the sample bag holders on the cameras and John has been holding a pack in his hand.  Here, he needs to seal the rake-sample bag and needs to have Charlie hold the unused bags.]<p>

[Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:24:10</b> Young: (To Houston) Okay.  That's in bag number 347.<p>

<b>169:24:13</b> England: Okay.  Bag 347.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[At this point, John is probably putting the rake sample in Charlie's SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:24:20</b> Duke: Okay.  (Will you) get an &quot;after&quot;, John?<p>

<b>169:24:23</b> Young: Yeah, I'll get it.<p>

<b><a name="1692425">169:24:25</a></b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>169:24:30</b> Young: Okay.  7 (foot focus).  &quot;After.&quot;<p>

<b>169:24:37</b> Duke: Old &quot;after&quot;!

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie as he backs up to get his shadow off the sample area.  John takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; from the south, AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18683" target="new">18683</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>169:24:38</b> England: Right.  We're going to want a rake soil, over in the area of the old (meaning &quot;first&quot; or &quot;original&quot;) Station 10, also.  So it's up to you whether it's easiest to go get it now or to get the double core now.  (Pause)  After you're through with this one (meaning the soil sample at this rake site).

<blockquote><i>[As shown in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-13</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, John and Charlie did Station 10 about 30 meters east of the 2-meter boulder.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:24:51</b> Young: Let's get the soil, Charlie.<p>

<b>169:24:52</b> Duke: We'll get the soil.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has been holding a pack of sample bags in his right hand.  He comes over to John and gives him the bags.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:24:54</b> Duke: Okay, I think it would be easier to go get it, John, because I've got to take...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie twists the rake so he can drag the <a href="../tools/judy38.jpg" title="image" target="new">solid, side portion</a> through the soil to get the soil sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:24:58</b> Duke: To do the double core...<p>

<b>169:25:00</b> Young: Right; I agree with you.<p>

<b>169:25:01</b> Duke: ...I got to take this thing apart.  We could...(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie raises the rake and pours the soil sample into a bag John is holding.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:25:09</b> England: That's a good idea, Charlie.  Then you won't need the rake anymore.<p>

<b>169:25:14</b> Duke: Yeah. 

<blockquote><i>[The rake is mounted on the extension handle, which Charlie will need to do the double core.  As Judy Allton indicates in Table 6 of her &quot;Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools and Containers&quot;, John and Charlie have two extension handles.  The scoop is currently attached to the other handle and is probably mounted on the back of the Rover at the present moment.  Charlie could use either extension handle to do the double core, but the point is that, to get a soil sample he will need the rake and there is no point in doing the double core before he finishes with the rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:25:16</b> Duke: Okay.  There's a two...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie steps toward John and takes the unused bags so John can seal the soil sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:25:21</b> Young: Okay, and that's going into bag 348.  (Bag) 348, Houston.<p>

<b>169:25:25</b> England: Okay; 348.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[After spinning the bag closed, John steps to Charlie's right side and puts the soil sample in his SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:25:38</b> Duke: (Pointing past the Rover) That (meaning the first Station 10)'s just right over the ridge there about 50 meters, isn't it?<p>

<b>169:25:41</b> England: Yeah, it should be.<p>

<b>169:25:42</b> Young: What's that, Charlie?<p>

<b>169:25:43</b> Duke: That old Station 10.<p>

<b>169:25:44</b> Young: Yeah.  (Pause)<p>

<b>169:25:50</b> Duke: Ah, the old (French pronounciation) orange (drink).  Okay, get an &quot;after&quot; of that, John...(of the) scoop.

<blockquote><i>[John's cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; of the soil sample is AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18684" target="new">18684</a>, taken from the south.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:25:56</b> Duke: How about swapping; I'll bag, and you rake.<p>

<b>169:25:59</b> Young: Yeah.  Let's do that.

<blockquote><i>[John takes the rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:26:01</b> Duke: Okay, I'll get the gnomon.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets into position to bob down to get the gnomon.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:26:04</b> Young: Why don't you let me get the gnomon.  I'll drop it over there, because I can get down a lot easier. <p>

<b>169:26:06</b> Duke: Okay, go ahead.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie backs away from the gnomon.  Recall that the gnomon staff came off earlier in the mission and, in order to retrieve the gnomon, he would have to get down to within a few inches of the ground and grab the legs.  Throughout the mission, John has had a much easier time getting low to the ground and is confident that he can retrieve the gnomon and then place it at the double core site wherever he wants.  See the discussion following <a href="a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new">119:24:37</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:26:12</b> Young: (Unsure that he's got it) No.<p>

<b>169:26:13</b> Duke: (You) got it.

<blockquote><i>[John bobs down and grabs the gnomon easily with his right hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:26:14</b> Young: It didn't...(Pause)<p>

<b>169:26:18</b> Duke: The old Station 10 ...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes off-camera to the right and John goes off to the left.  Fendell decides to pan left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:26:19</b> England: You got that down smooth, John.<p>

<b>169:26:21</b> Duke: That was...(Stops to listen)  Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[In Houston, Flight is being told that telemetry is indicating that roll indicator on the ALSEP mortar package is off-scale.  Experiments wants the crew to make sure the mortar package is actually level.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:26:29</b> Young: See these neat little craters?  You just run right through them.  (Pause)  There's a lot of tracks around there, Charlie.  That must be the old Station 10 right there.<p>

<b>169:26:47</b> Duke: It's right over here.  It is, yeah.  Here's where we took the double...You want it where we had the double core, Tony?<p>

<b>169:26:55</b> England: Say again, Charlie?  The double core will be at this rake site, but while you've got the rake out there...<p>

[Fendell pans farther right and gets the magnetometer at the left edge of the TV picture.  Realizing that he isn't going to find the mortar package at maximum zoom, he pulls back.

[Fendell pans left and stops with the Central Station at right center.  The mortar package is the white object left of center.  The question is: does anyone in Houston recognize it?  Flight asks Lovell if the Backroom really wants to delete the double core and Lovell says that they would rather not but that it may be necessary if they &quot;can't satisfy ALSEP with the TV camera.&quot;  Tony chimes in and points out that, while Charlie does the double core, John can go over to examine the mortar package, particularly since he was the one who deployed it.  Of all the people in Houston, Tony and backup Commander Fred Haise probably understand the situation and the possibilities better than anyone.]</i></blockquote>

[In Houston, someone realizes that the white object left of center in the TV picture is the mortar package and Fendell zooms in.  As he does so, the mortar package antenna becomes obvious.  After just a moment, we hear, &quot;Flight, (this is) ALSEP.  We're happy.  We've had a transducer failure.&quot;  This is one of several instances during the J missions when the TV was successfully used as a mission tool beyond its intended role as a means of gathering geologic information and documentation.  A sensor on the mortar package was telling the experimenters that the package was rolled 12 degrees away from vertical - enough to jeopardize the experiment - but the TV clearly indicates that the package is still sitting level the way John left it.]<p>

[Fendell now pulls back on the zoom and pans right, looking for the crew.]<p>

[Charlie steps up to the double core and hits it three times, left-handed.  The hammer turns in his hand and he stops to adjust his grip.  He then hits it seven more times before having to adjust his grip once again.

<b>169:39:48</b> Young: Well, Houston, I'm looking, but I'm not seeing any vesicular basalts.<p>

<b>169:39:52</b> England: Okay.  After you get this core packed up, why don't you drive on back to the LM to the normal closeout position, and we'll let you sample around there.  See if you can find one around there.  You described something in a crater behind the LM.<p>

<b>169:40:10</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[No where in the transcript does Charlie mention any rocks in the crater behind the LM as being vesicular basalts.  His mention of a rock he thought might be a vesicular basalt under the engine bell is at <a href="a16.lrvdep.html#1191736" target="new">119:17:36</a>.]<p>

<b>169:43:56</b> England: Okay.  Fine.

<blockquote><i>[In the interest of saving time, Flight had asked <a href="../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new">Fendell</a> if it would be okay for John to drive back to the LM without switching the LCRU off.  Fendell said that wouldn't be a problem.]</i></blockquote>

<b>169:43:58</b> England: And, John, when you drive over we don't have to reconfigure the LCRU.  Just drive it the way it is and then re-align (the high-gain antenna) and brush it (meaning the top  of the LCRU) off when you got there.<p>

<b>169:44:07</b> Young: All right, (I) will.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie comes into view at the left side of the TV picture. As he gets close to the LM, he angles around the south side of the spacecraft, passing close to the UV camera.  If Charlie left the Rover at 169:43:51, he makes his turn to the right 49 seconds later at 169:44:40, he covered  about 70 meters at a speed of about 5.1 km/hr.  His 48-m run back to the LM from Station 10, starting shortly after <a href="a16.sta10.html#1492040" target="new">149:20:40</a>, has much more complete TV coverage than this one.  The estimated speed for that run is 4.8 km/s.  He did both runs using his loping stride and seemed to run with similar ease both times.]</i></blockquote>

After a brief examination, Charlie moves farther right, probably having dropped the sample because it was a breccia.  After moving several meters, Charlie stops and moves a rock with the scoop, but then moves on again without bothering to pick it up.  Clearly, he is having no trouble recognizing breccias once he gets close enough to see the clasts.]</i></blockquote>

I just picked up one, that is (now) in bag 15, that has a black matrix - bluish-black matrix - with lath-like either clasts or phenocrysts in it.  And it's right behind the LM here.  I don't know whether that's what we're looking for or not.<p>

<b>169:47:50</b> England: Okay.  That sounds good, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[This sample is 60235, a 70-gram breccia with crystalline clasts, which are the features he described as being &quot;lath-like&quot;.
