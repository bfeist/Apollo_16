<blockquote><i>[The planned EVA-3 traverse is shown in the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp265.jpg" title="image" target="new">EVA-I-III 2 of 2 Contour Map</a>&quot; and in the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp266-s.jpg" title="image" target="new">Descartes EVA-I, III 2 of 2</a>&quot; map.  Because of the delayed landing, John and Charlie will drive, as planned, to the rim of North Ray Crater and spend one hour in the general vicinity of the planned locations of Stations 11 and 12.  They will then head back to the LM and make a single stop somewhere on the North Ray ejecta blanket.  Readers may wish to note that Cat Crater, the planned location of Station 14, was named for Charlie's sons, <b>C</b>harles <b>A</b>nd <b>T</b>homas, while Dot Crater, the planned location of Station 16, was named for Charlie's wife, Dotty.]<p>

[Details of the first part of the traverse are shown in the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3</a>&quot; map.  The LM is near CB.1/80.6 and, as indicated on the map, the first leg of the planned traverse is a drive of 0.8 km on a heading of 030.]<p>

[A <a href="AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new">labeled detail from Pan Camera frame 4618</a> shows the area covered during EVA-3 and the locations that coincide with the Nav system readouts Charlie gives during the drive to North Ray.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1660913">166:09:13</a></b> Duke: Okay.  We're all set to go.  And off we go. <p>

<b>166:09:16</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>166:09:18</b> Duke: Okay.  First heading out of here, John, is 030. 030 supposedly.  Okay.  The DAC is On.<p>

<b>166:09:33</b> Young: Shoot, that thing (possibly the DAC) drifts.<p>

<b><a name="1660951">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b> ( <a href="a16a1660951.mp3" target="new">10 min 01 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>166:09:51</b> England: Charlie, can you turn that DAC off for another 19 minutes?

<blockquote><i>[Evidently Houston wants to make sure that the DAC doesn't run out of film during the approach to North Ray Crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:09:54</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  I'm going to be spending...(Stops to listen).

<blockquote><i>[Charlie may be saying that he will have to hold the DAC to keep it from moving.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:09:57</b> England: I'll give you a mark (when to turn the DAC on).<p>

<b>166:09:58</b> Duke: Okay.  (Listens to Tony)  Okay, it's Off.<p>

<b>166:10:06</b> Young: I'll tell you, this ridge up here (north of the LM) would be a good place to park the Rover, Houston, if you want (to watch the launch from the north)....We're reading...I think it (meaning the Rover Nav system)'s working.  It's reading 162 and 0.1 now.  And that's how far away we are.<p>

<b>166:10:20</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>166:10:21</b> Young: This ridge would be a good place to park the Rover. Up north of it (that is, north of the LM).  I don't know if you (meaning the LRV electronics package and associated radiators) can stand it thermally.<p>

<b><a name="1661028">166:10:28</a></b> Duke: I don't think they can pan the camera like that, when we lift off.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[At the end of the EVA, John will park the Rover about 100 meters east of the LM so Houston can watch the lift-off.  With the Rover in that position, <a href="../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new">Ed Fendell</a> only has to pan the camera up to follow the LM. Charlie is saying that, while the ridge might be a good vantage point, Fendell would have trouble panning left to right to follow the LM once it pitched over at an altitude of 800 feet.  John's concern was the increased thermal load on the front of the Rover with it parked facing south rather than west.]<p>

[The following is taken from a conversation I had with Ed Fendell at his Houston office on August 13, 1996.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;My reason for being here, Ed, is to ask you to talk about how you got prepared for doing the J-mission TV and anything you think readers of the Journal need to know about how the Apollo TV system evolved.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;Well, let me give it to you this way.  I'll tell you what I can remember; because I've got a good friend of mine who was one of the senior flight directors at that time - Pete Frank.  Pete and I are pretty good friends and we worked on Habitat for Humanity together and different things.  And he just retired from Loral.  And we were talking about remembering things and he says, 'It's not only the point that you forget things, it's the point that you remember certain things and then somebody else says something and you find out that you remembered it wrong.'  And this conversation went on yesterday; it had nothing to do with you.  A good friend of ours passed away and we had a funeral we had to go to.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;Anyways, let me see if I can kinda go back and start with the right place and see what I can help you with.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;Prior to Apollo 10, all the communications equipment was spread out in the Control Center in different areas.  For example, the Lunar Module communications equipment belonged to the Lunar Module guys.  You know, the TELMU guys.  And the Command Module equipment belonged to the Command Module guys.  And the erectable antenna we had to go on the Moon and the backpack stuff and all that belonged to the experiments people.  On 10, we tried to separate (meaning undock) the two vehicles but we couldn't get a Go on the comm between the Lunar Module and the CSM.  We couldn't make it work.  And we fooled around for two or three hours - I can't remember how long - and, finally, we got it to work and found out that we were just configured wrong.  The Lunar Module guys (at Mission Control) were not talking correctly to the Command Module guys and vice versa.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;This was pre-flight?&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;This was during the mission.  We were out of configuration.  The switches were not matched up between the two vehicles. So we got that straightened out and we separated and went on to do the mission.  When the mission was over, Kranz came up to me - and I go way back; I'm an ex-Capsule Communicator back at the Cape and I'm an ex-air traffic controller.  Anyway, Kranz came up to me said 'We're going to form a communications section, and you're going to run it.'  See, I was an assistant Flight Director in those days.  And I said, 'Yeah'.  And he said, 'We're going to take all this gear out of all the different areas and we're going to put it all into one section and you're going to run it.'  And I said, 'Who am I going to run it with?' And he said, 'the following people.' and there was only three guys who knew communications out of the twelve or so people.  Anyways, we took it over and we started doing it on 11 and then it progressed down the line and we built this thing up and we started coming along.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;We flew 11, we flew 12, and we got to 13...And, in the meantime, a guy by the name of Bill Perry, an engineer over in the telecommunications division, came up with a design for actually controlling a (TV) camera - from the ground or remotely.  It (meaning Perry's concept) went through a PRCB (Program Review Control Board) to decide whether or not the program wanted to do this.  And each directorate had to come in and make their pitch.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;When was this?&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;I can't remember exactly when this was; but it's kind of an interesting story.  Anyways, I, being a communications guy, went up to make the pitch for Flight Operations Directorate.  At that time, Kraft had just moved from the head of Flight Operations to the head of the Center and he was there at the Board.  And I had a 'one chart'.  My pitch was one slide.  'FOD has no requirement for remote TV.'  That is what it said. That was it.  Well, we got going on this thing and just ahead of me was a fellow by the name of Tony Calio, who later on ended up becoming a director up at NASA Headquarters.  Well, Tony headed up Science and Applications Division, which were the guys who controlled the geologists and everything else.  And he got up there and started making the pitch for them; and he was saying how they had no requirement for this thing.  Well, Kraft got a hold of him and ate him a new butt hole.  I mean, he was chewing him...'What do you mean?  This is stupid.  This is your chance...This is no foresight...'  And he was eating him alive; and I'm sliding down in this chair, trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;There was a guy by the name of Mel Brooks, who's over in Europe now, and he was the Assistant Director of Flight Operations and he comes running back to me and he says, 'Get rid of your slide!  Get rid of your slide!'  And I said, 'I can't; it's already up with the projectionist.'&quot;]<p>

[&quot;So, anyways, he ate on Tony for about forty-five minutes.  I don't know how well you know Chris, but Chris can just eat you alive.  He's a good friend of mine; but he's the most outstanding person I've ever met in my life.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;Well, he gets all done with him (meaning Calio) and I walk up there and the guy throws up my slide.  And the place just came apart. Everybody just started hollering and I thought Kraft was going to die.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;Well, that's how it all started.  The end result is we were directed to go off and do this.  They put together what they called a Tiger Team and it works out that the guy who did the actual procurement job - he was the procurement officer - is running this building (that houses Ed's 1996 office).  And there was this guy Bill Perry, and another guy by the name of Olin Graham out of telecommunications, who was his boss.  And there was - oh - about eight of us.  And it was sole-sourced to RCA-Camden (New Jersey) to build the LCRU.  It (meaning the development of the TV and the LCRU) was a two-pronged thing: they (RCA-Camden) were going to build the LCRU and then, (for construction of the TV camera), a procurement went out and an RFP (Request for Proposal).  We had two bidders (on the camera) - RCA-Hightstown (New Jersey) and Westinghouse - and, after doing the Source Board, RCA-Hightstown was picked over Westinghouse.  Westinghouse had the Command Module camera.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;We started traveling back and forth and working it.  And we worked it a little different from normally;  they basically took Bill Perry's design on the camera controls (TCU) and implemented the whole thing together.  Both companies bid, basically, on Bill Perry's control design (for) the camera and the motors and the gears.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I know the setup from a crew operations perspective where they mount the LCRU on the front of the Rover and then they mount the TCU and then the camera.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;So, that was all put together and we started training.  And the real question came about: 'Well, how are we going to do this?'  One, we had to put in commands in the Control Center to operate it.

And what we did in the Control Center was we build two types of commands. Pan Right was a command; Pan Left was a command; Pan Stop was a command. Tilt Up; Tilt Down; Tilt Stop.  Zoom In; Zoom Out; Zoom Stop.  The other thing we did was we built what we called Three-Degree commands.  'Cause the way we did that was, underneath each one of the depressions of the PBI (Push Button Indicator) was a Pan Right Increment command.  So, when you send Pan Right Increment, the control went up to turn the camera to the right (and then) it waited the appropriate amount of time, and then automatically sent Pan Stop.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And it's called a 'three-degree command' because that's how far it goes, about half the width of the six-degree field-of-view (at minimum zoom).&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;Yeah.  So we had increments for left and right (and) zoom in and out.  So that you could tweak (the pointing and zoom).  See, you've got to understand you had that delay time on the camera (response).&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Absolutely.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;So we built the commands to do that.  (For example), on the thing you saw when the Lunar Module lifted off, those commands were not sent by watching the Lunar Module.  They were sent on time (that is, at pre-planned times relative to the instant of lift-off), because we were moving the camera to where the Lunar Module was supposed to be. (There was) a fellow named Harley Weyer (pronounced 'wire'), who worked for me and is now retired from NASA,  and Harley had figured all that out.  And that's the way that worked.  We watched it going up (in elevation), then opened up (on the zoom), and then (watched it) going down (as the apparent elevation decreased with increasing LM range from the TV).   And we only got to do it right once (on Apollo 17), because the (TCU TV) motors froze the first time (on Apollo 15), etc.&quot;]<p>

[As usual, Charlie has been taking pictures.  The frames covering the first part of the traverse begin with AS16-111-
<a href="images16.html#18034" target="new">18034</a>.  He takes <a href="images16.html#18036" target="new">18036</a> - with the summit of Smoky Mountain just visible - as they are about to reach the ridge summit.  A rough indication of the intervals in which various photos were taking is given in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-6LPI.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-6</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>.]<p>

[Charlie's next <a href="a16trv18034-40.jpg" title="strip of images" target="new">seven traverse photos</a> are AS16-111-<a href="images16.html#18034" target="new">18034</a> to <a href="images16.html#18040" target="new">18040</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1661034">166:10:34</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony. We're topping out of the little ridge. We can now see Dome and Smoky.  On top of the ridge, there are boulders much like we seen yesterday.  (The boulders are) half a meter or so. Cobbles (cover) about 5 percent of the surface.  Looks like a lot of secondaries though.  The boulder population is really concentrated around the secondaries;  and we'll get some pictures of that.  The regolith up here is identical (to that around the LM).  You can see these little lineations which is, I think, a function of Sun angle.

<blockquote><i>[The formal definition of 'cobble' is a piece of rock between about 64 mm and 256 mm; a 'boulder is anything bigger than about 256 mm = 0.26 m.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:11:25</b> Young: I think the boulder population is starting to thin, Charlie.<p>

<b>166:11:27</b> Duke: I do, too.  They're getting smaller, and the cobbles are getting smaller.  Looks like we could be just out of this ray.  We don't see any - maybe one or two - of the half-a-meter-size boulders now, Tony.<p>

<b>166:11:41</b> England: Okay, we copy that.  There are a couple of those mounds mapped about 200 meters off to your left.  We were wondering if you could see those.

<blockquote><i>[Tony may be referring to features similar to the meter-sized conical mounds of soil that Pete Conrad and Al Bean found near the Apollo 12 ALSEP deployment site.  However, to be even marginally visible in the photos available at this time to the geologists in the Backroom, mounds would have to be at least two to three meters tall.  I don't see anything suggestive of mounds on the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3</a>&quot; map in the indicated area.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1661151">166:11:51</a></b> Duke: Nope.  I got 179 - 180 now - at 0.3; and really on top of a ridge here.   And...

<blockquote><i>[A LM <a href="AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new">bearing of 180 and a range of 0.3</a> puts them near <a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="map" target="new">CC.6/80.6</a>]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:12:05</b> Young: Better go over this way more, Charlie.<p>

<b>166:12:07</b> Duke: Yeah.  There's North Ray right up there.  Look at the big rocks (on the rim of North Ray), John.<p>

<b>166:12:10</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b><a name="1661211">166:12:11</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  You got a good view of North Ray here, and as I look at it, there's a northeast-southwest line of boulders that come out from the southwest rim and go up - (correcting himself) the northeast rim - Smoky Mountain.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's next <a href="a16trv18041-47.jpg" title="strip of images" target="new">seven traverse photos</a> are AS16-111-<a href="images16.html#18041" target="new">18041</a> to <a href="images16.html#18047" target="new">18047</a>.]<p>

[Traverse photo AS16-111-<a href="images16.html#18044" target="new">18044</a> shows the view of North Ray Crater and the big boulders on the rim.  The photograph does not capture details that John and Charlie can see with their eyes. House Rock is labeled in a <a href="a16lbldet18045HR.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail from 18045</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:12:33</b> Young: See, there's Palmetto, too.<p>

<b><a name="1661235">166:12:35</a></b> Duke: Yeah, we see Palmetto.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[<a href="AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new">Palmetto Crater</a> has a diameter of about 1000 meters and the southern rim is about 800 meters north of their present position.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1661240">166:12:40</a></b> Duke: Coming down the ridge now.  We look like we're going into a big sag-type area.  It's at 12 o'clock and 300 or 400 meters, and we're now at <a href="AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new">188 at 0.4</a>.

<blockquote><i>[They are near <a href="a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new">CD.1/80.9</a>.  Frame AS16-111-
<a href="images16.html#18052" target="new">18052</a> probably shows the start of the descent.  The &quot;big sag&quot; area may be a shallow feature about 200 meters in diameter which is centered near <a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="map" target="new">CE.1/80.6</a>.  At about this time, John angles his track to the east and goes around it, thinking they have reached Palmetto Crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:12:53</b> Young: We may be into Palmetto right now, Charlie. <p>

<b>166:12:55</b> Duke: Huh?<p>

<b>166:12:57</b> Young: (This) may be Palmetto.<p>

<b>166:12:58</b> Duke: No.  That's over there on the rim, isn't it? <p>

<b>166:12:59</b> Young: Huh?<p>

<b>166:13:00</b> Duke: That big thing right there?

<blockquote><i>[Journal Contributor Thierry Bisiaux notes that the character of Charlie's voice changes here and it seems likely that he lowered his head to look at the map.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:13:04</b> Duke:   No, Palmetto's at...<p>

<b>166:13:05</b> England: You should be about halfway to Palmetto. <p>

<b>166:13:06</b> Duke: ...(a range of) 2.1.<p>

<b>166:13:09</b> England: You're looking (to be) right below (meaning &quot;a bit south of&quot;) <a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="map" target="new">Turtle Mountain</a>, we bet.<p>

<b>166:13:11</b> Young: Yeah.  That's where we are.<p>

<b>166:13:17</b> Duke: Okay.  Up at Station 11 and 12...<p>

<b>166:13:20</b> Young: Any resemblance between this and the topo is going to the devil.

<blockquote><i>[John is probably referring to the site model they used in training.

</i></blockquote>

<b>166:13:23</b> Duke: I'll tell you.  It sure is.  Okay; we're going downslope now, Tony.  (It's) about a 5-degree slope, and we're going to go down perhaps 50 or 60 meters before we start climbing back out again towards Palmetto.  (Pause)  And up around North Ray, we see two tremendous blocks at about Station 11 and 12 that appear to be black in color. Black with white spots.  And we're just about out of the ray material now.  We only see a few cobbles left.<p>

<b>166:14:02</b> England: Okay.  It might be a good idea to try to get there (near the large boulder) for our Station 11.<p>

<b>166:14:10</b> Duke: That's what I thought we were going to pick:  those two big - big rocks.<p>

<b>166:14:14</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>166:14:15</b> Duke: It's right up on that ridge.  (Pause) That might be...That's Palmetto right there, I guess, off to the left there, isn't it, John?  Course, we've only been 0.6 though.  Tony, we're at <a href="AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new">195 at 0.6</a>, and there's a big depression off to our 2 o'clock position on a heading of 030, with some white boulders on the inner rim.  It's a very subdued feature, but it does have stuff, at least around the rim...The south rim...Wow! Great!

<blockquote><i>[John may have just bounced the Rover by hitting a small crater.]<p>

[They are near <a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="map" target="new">CE.0/81.4</a>.  They are driving on a heading of 030 and a 2 o'clock relative azimuth would put the &quot;<a href="AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new">big depression</a>&quot; directly east of them.  This suggests that Charlie is looking at the feature at <a href="a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new">CE.5/84.0</a> which is about five hundred meters from their current location.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:14:52</b> Young: (We're) all right, Charlie.<p>

<b>166:14:53</b> Duke: The east side is a very shallow slope into this pit.

<b>166:14:57</b> Young: How far are we supposed to go this way before we turn back?<p>

<b>166:15:01</b> Duke: Just keep going.  Straight out.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As indicated on the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3</a>&quot; map, once they get to a range of 0.8 and a LM bearing of 210, they will turn to a heading of 356 and drive another 1.4 kilometers until they are past Palmetto.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:15:08</b> England: You should be heading of about 356.<p>

<b>166:15:09</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony) turn...(Stops to listen)  Yeah. Now...At 0.8, you can turn to about 356. <p>

<b>166:15:18</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>166:15:20</b> Duke: Okay.  Tony, this big depression off to the left that I was describing (meaning the 'big sag' he mentioned at 166:12:40)...on the east side it's a very shallow slope into it, about 4 or 5 degrees.  But, on the far end, the west side and the southwest side, it has very steep walls, 20 degrees or so<p>

<b>166:15:36</b> Young: (Garbled)<p>

<b>166:15:37</b> England: Right.  Understand.  You're looking right at the base of Turtle Mountain.<p>

<b>166:15:38</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony) piece of cake, John.  (Hearing Tony)  Okay.<p>

<b>166:15:46</b> Young: Listen, Houston.  (Laughs) I hate to tell you this, but these mountains don't look the same (as they did in the training model).<p>

<b>166:15:53</b> Duke: Which mountain?  Those straight...<p>

<b>166:15:57</b> Young: Where's Turtle Mountain.  Right here?<p>

<b>166:15:58</b> Duke: It's off to the left, way off to the left. We just passed it.  We could do a 360 and get a pan of it.<p>

<b>166:16:03</b> Young: How about that rock there, Charlie?<p>

<b><a name="1661608">166:16:08</a></b> Duke: And it's got some lineations in it, huh?<p>

<b>166:16:09</b> Young: Yeah.  Look at the size of it.<p>

<b>166:16:13</b> Duke: Oh, this big one coming up, you mean? <p>

The black, 10-meter boulder at the right is House Rock, which they will visit just before they leave North Ray.  They will park the Rover near the white boulders straight ahead.  They are looking for crystalline bedrock and the white color of the rocks ahead suggest they are composed of anorthosite.

<b>166:40:07</b> Young: Sure is.<p>

<b>166:40:11</b> Duke: Sure is, Tony.  You were right.  We just climbed...What we thought was the rim of one of these little hummocks.<p>

<b>166:40:17</b> England: Right...<p>

<b>166:40:18</b> Duke: Little hummocks!  It was a pretty steep hummock.<p>

<b>166:40:20</b> England: ...Just like mountain climbing, there's always another ridge.<p>

<b>166:40:27</b> Duke: Okay.  I'm going to pan the DAC around to get to that boulder field that goes up to Smoky Mountain.  It's really tremendous. The boulders are very angular over there.  They're dark gray in color, and some of them are almost solid white.  The most unique ones appear to be solid white.  Up on the rim here, they appear to be almost white;  none of the dark ones.  (Pause)  And we're at <a href="AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new">180 at 4.1</a>.  Smooth regolith.

<b>166:41:09</b> Young: The rim is right there!<p>

<b>166:41:10</b> Duke: No, sir.  I bet it's over there to the left where those rocks are.  But you might be right.  (Pause)  That's too far away. You're right.  That's probably too far west.<p>

<b>166:41:22</b> England: We think the most direct route from where you are...<p>

<b>166:41:23</b> Young: Okay;  we're at one-eighty at four point...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>166:41:24</b> England: ...to the rim would be about a heading of 350.<p>

<b>166:41:33</b> Duke: Okay!  We're headed that way.  And there's some beautiful...Those white rocks are...<p>

<b>166:41:40</b> Young: Right on the rim, Charlie!<p>

<b>166:41:41</b> Duke: ...right on the rim.<p>

<b>166:41:42</b> England: Outstanding.  Can you see on around to see if there are any black rocks around at 3 o'clock in the crater?<p>

<b>166:41:51</b> Duke: Well, we can't see in the crater.  But around at the 3 o'clock position, yeah, there's a biggie.  The biggest one (which is House Rock), Tony, is this 10- to 15-meter boulder that is on the rim;  and it's blackish.

<blockquote><i>[Some geologists had a pre-flight concept of the site as having a variety of volcanic features overlying an anorthositic bedrock. If the North Ray impact was big enough to have penetrated to bedrock, then John and Charlie might have found both black volcanic rocks and white anorthositic rocks.  As it turns out, although House Rock is very dark, it is a breccia and not of volcanic origin.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:42:04</b> England: Okay.  Is there any chance of working around towards that contact?  And if we could get both the white and black in one stop, that would be really fine.<p>

<b>166:42:15</b> Young: It's...No way!<p>

<b>166:42:17</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>166:42:18</b> Duke: Right.  Pretty far.  I think we can do it with a short stop over there.  And when we get up there, Tony, we might be able to find a black rock.<p>

<b>166:42:27</b> England: Okay.  Fine<p>

<b>166:42:28</b> Duke: Okay.  We're going through a...We're definitely on the ejecta blanket here.  And, oh, within 100 meters or so, I think, of the rim.<p>

<b>166:43:20</b> Young: There's the rim.<p>

<b>166:43:22</b> Duke: Yeah.  There it is.  Okay.  I think we can get over there and maybe get them a picture.  We're headed about 360, aren't we?<p>

<b>166:43:31</b> Young: Yep.<p>

<b>166:43:33</b> Duke: That is...That big...I can't believe the size of that big black rock over here.  And I don't think that's a breccia, John, because...Although it might be.  I see some large white clasts.  (Pause)<p>

<blockquote><i>[David Harland notes that, although the drive to North Ray has taken far less time than planned, a recommendation is made to the Flight Director not to spend more time at North Ray than had been planned.  Because of the six-hour landing delay, EVA-3 activities have been dramatically curtailed so as not to eat into planned reserves of LM consumables, and this recommendation is consistent with that general approach to the EVA.]</i></blockquote>
