As shown in Figures <a href="a16ppD2f12.jpg" title="image" target="new">12</a> and <a href="a16ppD2f13.jpg" title="image" target="new">13</a> in the <a href="D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new">North Ray chapter</a> of the <a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">Apollo 16 Professional Paper</a>, John has parked the Rover close to the rim crest at North Ray Crater.  The white boulders are about 55 meters west of the Rover.  As can be seen in the <a href="a16ppD2f3.jpg" title="contour map" target="new">post-mission contour map</a>,  the crater is not perfectly circular and has a maximum diameter of about 1100 meters and a minimum diameter of about 1000 meters.  It is about 230 meters deep.  The inner walls are steep - roughly a 30 to 35 degrees slope - and, from John and Charlie's perspective on the rim, a substantial part of the crater is not visible.]<p>

<b>166:47:14</b> Young: Man, does this thing have steep walls.<p>

<b>166:47:16</b> Duke: They said 60 degrees.<p>

<b>166:47:18</b> Young: Now, I tell you, I can't see to the bottom of it, and I'm just as close to the edge as I'm going to get.  (Charlie laughs) That's the truth.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Meteor Crater (in Arizona) has got really steep walls to it.  Is this that kind of steepness?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That kind of steepness; yeah.  It really was.  I mean, it was really scary, getting up too close.  We kidded about it, but we weren't about to get real close.  And we could never (see the bottom)...even on the far (northwest) side.  You know, you get up on the rim of Meteor Crater and you can see the bottom - it was a little bit bigger, I think.  You could see the bottom on the other side but, here, you couldn't.&quot;]<p>

[Meteor Crater is about 1200 meters in diameter.  As can be seen in an <a href="a16meteorcrtr.gif" title="image" target="new">aerial photo</a> by Dr. David Roddy, the floor of Meteor Crater is flat and covers about half the diameter.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:47:44</b> England: Okay.  Our plan here is to range along the edge of the crater for about 80 meters, if you can do that.  And, Charlie, if you'll start out with your pan 1, then the 500 millimeter.  We'd also like you to shoot some more pictures of Smoky with the 500, and then take your far field stereo.  And then if you range on out as far as you can go, taking the 500 millimeter with you, take - and John with you - take a stereo of the inside of the crater with the 500 millimeter from as far away from the Rover as you can get.  And then stick the 500 millimeter in John's SCB, and then do your other far-field polarimetry, and then, from then on, all we've got is sampling.

<blockquote><i>[TV on.  We are looking at the southernmost white boulder.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:48:41</b> Young: Okay.  I think we probably ought to take all those things one at a time.<p>

<b>166:48:45</b> Duke: I do too.<p>

<b>166:48:46</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>166:48:48</b> Duke: Okay.  Do you want me to start out with the 500?<p>

<b>166:48:50</b> England: Right.  Go ahead and start out with your 500.

<blockquote><i>[Houston actually wanted Charlie to start with a normal pan but Tony's tone of voice suggests that he doesn't think that the order in which Charlie does the photography matters very much.]<p>

[Charlie hops into view.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:48:52</b> Duke: Okay.  You say, I start out with the 500?  (Hearing Tony)  Okay.  Okay, Tony; I have magazine Kilo (with) frame count 1, I think, it was.<p>

<b><a name="1664906">166:49:06</a></b> England: And we've got a picture.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has just put Mag Kilo (magazine 106) on the LMP Hasselblad and will put it to use to take three polarization pans after he finishes with the 500-mm photography.  Charlie undoubtedly looked at the frame counter on Mag Kilo before installing it.]<p>

[Charlie goes to the CDR seat to get the 500mm camera.  <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pans right and the other white boulders come into view.]<p>

[While Charlie gets the 500mm camera, John takes a <a href="a16pan1665537.jpg" title="image" target="new">Station 11 Pan</a> from a point below the Rover and close to a dramatic break in slope down into North Ray.  The pan consists of frames AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18592" target="new">18592</a> to 
<a href="images16.html#18614" target="new">18614</a>.  David Harland has assembled the portion showing <a href="a16.1665537_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new">North Ray and Charlie at the Rover</a>.]<p>

[Frame 
<a href="images16.html#18594" target="new">18594</a> shows the white boulders.  Frame 
<a href="images16.html#18603" target="new">18603</a> shows House Rock and Smoky Mountain.]<p>

[Frame 
<a href="images16.html#18607" target="new">18607</a> shows Charlie getting the 500mm camera from under the CDR seat.  Apollo 12 astronaut Al Bean used this picture as the basis of one of his most striking paintings, adding John at the other side of the Rover.  David Harland has assembled a <a href="a16.sta11lrv.jpg" title="image" target="new">portion</a> of the pan that resembles the Bean painting.]<p>

[The fact that John never mentions this pan led me to think that Charlie took it later, at about, <a href="#1665537" target="new">166:55:37</a>.  However, Journal Contributor Bob Fry pointed out in 1999 that the astronaut in AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18607" target="new">18607</a> does not have <a href="../alsj-CDRStripes.html" target="new">red stripes</a> on his suit and must be Charlie.  In addition, the relevant video record indicates that John has his camera throughout this interval.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:49:13</b> Duke: Okay.  Those rocks you're looking at now, Tony, are white and they look breccious to me.  The big black one (meaning House Rock) is off behind the TV.  And you're going towards the rim on the crater right now (as Fendell pans clockwise).

<blockquote><i>[Charlie runs off-camera to the right, using his skipping stride.  Fendell stops the pan to give the Backroom a chance to get a picture off the monitor.]<p>

[The following is taken from a 1996 conversation with Ed Fendell.  See, also, Fendell's October 2000 interview for the <a href="../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new">JSC Oral History Project</a>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Okay.  The crew pulls up at a geology stop and they
turn on the LCRU.  Then you do a pan of the scene.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;Right.  They pointed the antenna (and) locked the antenna up.  And the first thing we did was what we called a &quot;wrap&quot; for the science guys, for the USGS guys and so on, and that was put together by a guy named Tim Hait.  He was the guy who coordinated that.  What they wanted to do was to take the camera, swing it all the way to one stop (or pan limit) - either left or right - and then what we would do is we would pan it three degrees, sit a spell, and they would snap a Polaroid picture back in the Backroom.  And we would go all the way around and then, when they had all of that, they would tell us (they had all the pictures) and then we'd go get the crew.  And then they would take that (set of Polaroids) and make a mosaic of it and you've probably have seen pictures of that.  They cut and glued together and they used that for their planning in the back.  The Gordon Swann people, the <a href="../lee_silver.html" target="new">Lee Silvers</a>, and Bill Muehlberger and so on.  And then we would swing over and basically follow the crew.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;Now, every once in a while we would get a call from the back(room) saying, 'Hey, can you swing over and take a look at this?'  And two things were going on.  One, there were certain things they were interested in; but, mostly, they were really interested in what the crew was doing, because the crew was pretty well trained and they were doing the things that they wanted them to do.  But, occasionally they wanted some other pictures to try to figure out exactly where they were...A lot of times, they didn't know how close they were to the pre-planned site.  And other times, like on those big boulders, they wanted some extra shots of the rocks and so on.  And like when Dave Scott got the drill stuck, they wanted a real good look at that to try to figure out what to do.  And things like that.  But, in general, the main thing was to stay with the crew.  Pick a crewman and stay with him.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did the calls from the Backroom come to you through Flight?&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;No.  They came to us directly from a guy - I'm trying to remember what he was called.  The Mission Manager.  The Mission Planning Manager.  I forget what it was; but it was one single guy who talked to you.  I think it was a guy named Tim Hait.  He worked for Gordon Swann.  He was a USGS guy.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:49:34</b> Young: The unfortunate thing about it, Houston, is that rascally rim...It goes down...It slopes into it about, say, 10 or 15 degrees, which is the kind of slope I'm standing on right now; and then, all of a sudden, in order to see to the bottom, I've got to walk another 100 yards down a 25- to 30-degree slope, and I don't think I'd better.  Maybe we can drive around to the other side and see down into it.

<blockquote><i>[A <a href="a16.northray.jpg" title="image" target="new"> portion</a> of one of Charlie's pans that was assembled by David Harland shows the scene John is describing.]<p>

[As Fendell continues the clockwise pan, he finds Charlie joining John at the break in slope that John just described.  As shown in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-65</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, they are about 17 meters from the Rover and, if the intervening slope is 10 degrees, they are standing about 3 meters below the TV camera.  Fendell continues the pan and gets a view of the interior of the crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:50:13</b> England: Man, is that a hole in the ground!<p>

<b>166:50:14</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  The inside...(Stops to listen)  It really is.  I see no bedrock, though.  All I see is boulders around the
crater.  There's nothing that reminds me of bedding, just loose boulders.  Though it might very well be that it's so shocked that there could be real boulders...I mean, real bedrock there.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell is now looking at House Rock.  This boulder is 12 meters tall and has lateral dimensions of 16 by 20 meters.  Near the boulder, the surface slopes down toward the north and, consequently, we are not seeing the full vertical extent.  The southwest flank of Smoky Mountain is the background and the slope is littered with boulders ejected from North Ray.]<p>

[By collecting samples from the large rocks near the rim, they are certain of giving the geologists back home a look at material dug out by the impact from the deepest part of the crater.  One use of the samples is to estimate the age of North Ray Crater.  Rock that had been buried deep beneath the surface were not exposed to cosmic rays until dug out by the impact and it is possible to use geochemistry techniques to estimate how long the rocks have been exposed.  In 1975, <a href="../alsj-CosRayExposur.html" target="new">C.J. Morgan</a> was able to determine that North Ray is about 26 million years old.  In turn, good ages for a number of lunar craters permit improved estimates of the ages of other craters for which the only available indication of age is the number of smaller craters per unit area on the ejecta blanket.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:50:37</b> Young: Now, the layering, the boulder layers are
horizontally oriented; and, of course, they are all covered with talus. 
Over on the north wall, in particular, about 1/3 of the way from the top is a line of boulders that you probably ought to be able to see on the TV.  But they're all oriented right in that line, which would lead one to think that it has bedding there.  Don't you see that line right over there, Charlie?

<blockquote><i>[John is probably referring to the line of boulders about halfway down the visible portion of the north wall in AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18599" target="new">18599</a> and in AS16-106-
<a href="images16.html#17259" target="new">17259</a>.  See, also, Figure 23 in the North Ray chapter in the Professional Paper.]<p>

[Fendell is looking east toward Ravine Crater, which is dug into the
southern flank of Smoky Mountain.  Note the inbound Rover tracks in the foreground and the liberal sprinkling of blocks.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:51:11</b> Duke: I don't...I'm worrying about trying to get this crazy (500-mm) camera going here.<p>

<b>166:51:17</b> Young: Okay.  And the...(Pause)<p>

<b>166:51:24</b> England: Okay...<p>

<b>166:51:24</b> Young: The material is just completely different...The wall...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>166:51:25</b> England: ...That line of boulders on the north wall, what color were they?<p>

<b>166:51:30</b> Young: In this light, they appear to be dark boulders.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell is looking over the right-rear fender toward Stone Mountain.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:51:36</b> England: Okay.  Incidentally, the white rocks you see
there.  Do they look like the Cone-Crater-type white rocks?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to a group of very light-colored
boulders - called the White Rocks - that Shepard and Mitchell found near
the rim on Cone Crater during Apollo 14 EVA-2.  See Figures 3-19, -20, -21,
-28, -29 and -30 in the Apollo 14 Preliminary Science
Report.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:51:48</b> Duke: No, not to me.<p>

<b>166:51:51</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>166:51:55</b> Young: Better let me get a piece of one, Charlie.  I don't think...This is definitely a breccia right here, a big foot-and-a-half breccia.  It's a white matrix with dark clasts, and it looks to be a three-rock breccia.  Some of the dark clasts have even darker clasts than those.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[A 'three-rock breccia' consists of a matrix which contain inclusions which, themselves, contain inclusions.  This indicates that, when the three-rock breccia formed, pieces of pre-existing two-rock breccias became the inclusions in the matrix.]<p>

[Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1665224">166:52:24</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  (Before leaving the Rover) I picked up (probably means &quot;loaded into the camera&quot;) magazine Mike; it's on the 500.<p>

<b>166:52:29</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>166:52:30</b> Young: Okay.  Houston, I just picked up a grab sample of a breccia.  It's very friable.  It looks shocked;  it has black clasts in it, black clasts (which are) a couple of millimeters across.  (Pause)  It's so worn down that you know what it really looks like?  It looks like a...If I can use the analogy, (because) I'm not sure what the heck it is.  It looks like a tuff.  It just looks like a rock with a...You see, the clasts are sticking out of it, is what I'm saying.

<blockquote><i>[Tuffs are rocks formed of hot volcanic ash which fuses because of internal heat.  If the ash contains pieces of harder rock that was ejected from the throat of the volcano along with the ash, subsequent weathering will tend to erode the ash material first and leave the pieces of harder rock sticking out of the surface.  John is not suggesting that he has collected a piece of tuff but, rather, that the visual impression of the surface texture is tuff-like.  John's grab sample is 67035, a 245-gram, light-matrix breccia which is shown in Figure 62b in the Professional paper.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1665320">166:53:20</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  What other pictures you want me to get with the 500?  I've done the interior of the crater.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has taken and extensive <a href="a16pan1665320.jpg" title="image" target="new">500-mm partial pan</a> consisting of frames AS16-105- <a href="images16.html#17117" target="new">17117</a> to <a href="images16.html#17181" target="new">17181</a>.]<p>

[Charlie started the 500-mm photos with a left-to-right series along the rim and finished that series with 
<a href="images16.html#17141" target="new">17141</a>.]<p>

[Frames <a href="images16.html#17142" target="new">17142</a> to 
<a href="images16.html#17181" target="new">17181</a> are pictures of the interior of the crater.  Although many of these pictures are blurred, they
contain useful information.  Digital processing could be used
to remove most of the effects of the camera motions that produced the
blurring, although I don't believe that has been done as of March 2002.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:53:24</b> Duke: (At <a href="#1664744" target="new">166:47:44</a>, did) you say you want Smoky or Stone Mountain?<p>

<b>166:53:29</b> England: Okay.  We'd like some more pictures of Smoky.<p>

<b>166:53:38</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie, who is skipping uphill toward the
Rover.  John has just started uphill.  Charlie is carrying the 500mm camera and John is clearly wearing his own Hasselblad.  Charlie goes off-camera to the right, still coming uphill.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:53:41</b> England: And, John,...<p>

<b>166:53:43</b> Duke: Get up here where I can see it (meaning Smoky
Mountain).<p>

<b>166:53:43</b> England: ...in your mineral description there, could you
see a crystal shape?<p>

<b><a name="1665344">166:53:44</a></b> Young: Okay.  While Charlie's doing.. (Stops to listen)

<blockquote><i>[During the following transmission, John starts to examine the grab sample and then comes slowly to a stop so he can devote his full attention to it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:53:46</b> Young: &quot;Can I see a crystal shape?&quot;  I saw one clast.  One...No.  (Pause)  Well, the clasts in there are very angular.  Maybe that's a zap crater; that's probably what that is.

<blockquote><i>[A &quot;zap crater&quot; or &quot;zap pit&quot; is a very small crater blasted into the surface of a rock by a small, high-velocity impactor.]<p>

[John starts walking toward the Rover - still examining the sample -
and, apparently, is heading for his seat.  Fendell
follows.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:54:07</b> Young: I don't see in the...The white matrix doesn't have any crystalline structure that I can recognize.<p>

<b>166:54:17</b> England: Okay, fine.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John goes off-camera to the left and Fendell continues to pan left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:54:35</b> England: (Passing on a question) And, Charlie, verify that you turned the DAC off.<p>

<b>166:54:37</b> Young: Now, Tony, what is it you want me to do here?

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds John at the CDR seat where he is removing a sample bag from the dispenser on his camera.  During Tony's transmission that starts at 54:48, John bags the sample, spins the bag closed, and then folds the metal tabs to seal the bag.  Note that he folds one tab on one side of the bag and the other tab on the opposite side.  This is called &quot;Z-ing&quot;.  This may be the best video of sample bag closure in the Apollo record.  Note that John is still wearing his camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:54:41</b> Duke: Yeah, I think so.  I'll check again.<p>

<b>166:54:44</b> England: Okay.  After the 500 millimeter...<p>

<b>166:54:45</b> Young: What is it you want me to do here, Tony?<p>

<b><a name="1665448">166:54:48</a></b> England: We'd like Charlie, there, to go ahead and take his far-field pan of the crater and go on around and do a full pan.  It looks like you could probably do the thing from one place.

<blockquote><i>[John goes to the back of the Rover, going off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:54:59</b> England: And, John, we'd like you to start ranging out in the best traverse direction for about 80 meters, if you can go that far.  And survey the area as you go out, and Charlie will follow you along, and then sample as you come back.<p>

<b>166:55:17</b> Young: Okay.  That'll be 80 meters to the northeast, here (toward House Rock).<p>

<b>166:55:22</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>166:55:23</b> Young: (It's) no problem to do that, and...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>166:55:29</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  Pan is complete; and I'm up to 165 on magazine Mike.<p>

<b><a name="1665537">166:55:37</a></b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's use of the phrase &quot;pan is complete&quot; contributed to my confusion over the pan that John, in fact, took from below the Rover at <a href="#1664906" target="new">166:49:06</a>.  Here, Charlie is using the word &quot;pan&quot; to loosely describe the sequence of Smoky Mountain 500mm pictures he has just completed.  Those photos are frames AS16-105-
<a href="images16.html#17182" target="new">17182</a> to 
<a href="images16.html#17215" target="new">17215</a>.]<p>

[Fendell pans right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:55:38</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  My description of the crater:  Sixty percent of it is covered with boulders up to 3 meters.  Make that 50 percent of it on the interior;  we cannot see the bottom.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie at the left front of the Rover. He has the has the 500-mm lens, with its own camera body attached, in his right hand.  He is wearing the LMP camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:55:56</b> Duke: The boulders are splayed out from the center in rays that about every eighth to a quarter of a crater (circumference?)...you have a definite ray.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell continues to pan right.  Once the crater comes back into view, we can see the rays on the north and northwest walls.  They show up as streaks of lighter and darker colored material coming up radially out of the bottom of the crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:56:10</b> England: Okay.  And, John, did you get a bag number on that (grab sample)?<p>

<b>166:56:12</b> Duke: (To Tony) You still want me to take the 500 (when he and John go 80 meters to the northeast)?<p>

<b>166:56:16</b> Young: (Answering Tony's question about the sample bag number) Oh, yeah.  Excuse me.  It's 373, I think.<p>

<b>166:56:20</b> England: (To John) Okay; we copy that.<p>

<b>166:56:21</b> Young: It's in the bottom of SCB-7.  Anyway, I can identify that rock for you.<p>

<b>166:56:25</b> England: (To John) Okay, that's fine.  (Answering Charlie's question about taking the 500-mm lens) Yeah, Charlie.  After your 500 millimeter...<p>

<b>166:56:28</b> Duke: Tony, do you still want me to get...(Stops to
listen)<p>

<b>166:56:31</b> England: ...after your 500 millimeter, do the far field

then when you follow John along, take the 500 millimeter with you.

<blockquote><i>[The far-field polarimetry experiment consists of three
partial pans of North Ray Crater, with one taken at each of three settings
of the polarization filter - Left, Center, and Right - taken at two
separate locations.  The near-field polarimetry experiment, which has been
dropped from the station tasks consists of photos taken of selected rocks
at phase angles of 90, 110, and 130 degrees.  See <a href="a16eva3LMP-30.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-30</a>.

<b>166:56:45</b> Young: Okay.  You want me to help Tony to get - I mean
Charlie - to get the rocks?  You want to get the near-field (photos) first,
Charlie?<p>

<blockquote><i>[As Fendell pans past House Rock, John comes into view.  He
is carrying an SCB and starts to run in the general direction of House
Rock, intending to go out about 80 meters and, as Houston suggested, sample
on the way back to the Rover.  Note that John is not carrying either tongs
or a scoop.  Fendell follows him.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;If you look at the footprints, here, you can see we're
not sinking in very far at all.  It was very firm up there; there's not
much dust up on North Ray.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

an SCB) with that 500 millimeter in it, so we won't...<p>

<b>166:57:04</b> Young: Okay, I've got a sample bag, (meaning an SCB),
here.

<blockquote><i>[As John gets farther from the Rover, Fendell changes both
the zoom and the TV pointing.  In the process, he loses John for a few
seconds.  Just before John goes off-camera, we see his sample bag dispenser
on the ground.  We don't actually see it fall but, from the dialog at <a href="#1665755" target="new">166:57:55</a>, we know it falls off at some
point during the run.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1665708">166:57:08</a></b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  Okay, Tony. 
I'm starting this polarimetry from about the 10 o'clock position of the
Rover.

<b>166:57:25</b> England: Okay.  You're starting in the Right position?

<blockquote><i>[Tony is probably asking Charlie if he is at the right-hand
of the two locations from which he will take partial pans, the generic
location shown as a circled &quot;1&quot; on <a href="a16eva3LMP-30.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-30</a> and in Figure <a href="a16.lsp192.jpg" title="image" target="new">3.3-1</a> in
the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  Tony is probably not asking about the
setting of the polarizing filter.  In fact, after Charlie takes this first
trio of pans, he will move counter-clockwise along the crater rim and,
therefore, is currently at the Left position.  See the dialog at <a href="#1665935" target="new">166:59:35</a>.  Although Figure <a href="a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-65</a> in the
<a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a> indicates that he is taking these first partial
pans from about the same place as he took the unfiltered pan and the 500-mm
photos of the interior of North Ray, the TV record following <a href="#1665953" target="new">166:59:53</a> suggests he is actually west of
the Rover.]<p>

[Fendell finds John again.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:57:28</b> Duke: Ah.  (Pause)  Yeah, I'm starting in the Right
position. I've got f/6, 1/25, at 74 (feet focal distance).  And I'll do a
partial pan with each (filter) setting.  It's going to be about an
eight-picture pan.<p>

<b>166:57:46</b> England: Okay, good show.  (Pause)<p>

<blockquote><i>[John gets into position to grab the bags and drops to his knees.  It takes an extra second or so for him to actually grab the bags and, in that second, he starts to lose his balance and, as he rises, he pitches forward onto his hands and knees.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1665834">166:58:35</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  (The filter is) in the Left setting going from right to left.

<b>166:58:40</b> Young: (Having fallen) God damn it!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John has the SCB in his left hand and the bag dispenser in his right.  The most effective technique for getting up from your hands and knees while wearing the Apollo suit on the Moon is to push up and back, forcing your torso and backpack to rotate backwards over the knees and, then once your center of mass is over your feet, jumping up to your feet.  John doesn't try this but, instead, gets all of his weight on his left foreleg and then lifts his right hand and then his right knee off the ground.  He then pushes up with his left hand, brings his right foot forward a few inches and pushes up and forward with it enough that he starts to rise, and then runs forward to regain his balance.  He then heads for the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:58:48</b> Duke: Tony, we can look out at my 12 o'clock position here, I can look down and see a large block that's on this inner flank here that I can't...<p>

<b>166:59:03</b> Duke: It's dust covered, and I can't tell you what type it is.<p>

<b>166:59:09</b> Young: (Turning to look) Huh?

<blockquote><i>[Tony is probably looking at one of several fist-sized rocks near the place where John fell.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:59:10</b> England: We thought we saw something still lying there...<p>

<b>166:59:12</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>166:59:13</b> England: ...where you fell over.  Okay.

<b><a name="1665935">166:59:35</a></b> Duke: And I'm in the Left position; I'm going back to the right.  Now...Now, you want that stereo base, right?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is asking if Houston wants him to move far enough away from the first position that the combination of the two sets of pans will give good stereo of the far wall of the crater.  Our eyes are about 7.5 cm apart and, if the near field-of-view where we get good stereo extends to about one meter range, to get good photographic stereo of the far crater wall, which is about 1000 meters away, Charlie will have to move about 75 meters.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:59:42</b> England: That's right.  We'd like you to leave the
polarizer on and take the 500 millimeter with you, also; and then range out your 80 meters.  You can either take a SCB...<p>

<b>166:59:52</b> Duke: Okay.  We're gonna range...<p>

<blockquote><i>[John crosses the TV field-of-view from left to right.  He is wearing his camera.  As Fendell continues to pan left, Charlie comes into view, running back to the Rover from the west.  This suggests that he did not take the polarimetry pans from the position indicated in Figure

Fifty percent of the clasts in it are...or the clasts...or the matrix is...consist...(Chuckles)  Try that (description) again.  Looks like about 50 percent of the rock is black clasts, which was a lot more than the last rock I picked up, and it sure is friable.

spins the bag so hard that, after wrapping around itself several times, it
reverses direction and starts to come open.  John spins the bag a second
time and then seals it.  He then leans to his right and picks up the SCB. 
Because this is a new bag and is still flattened,  John pulls it into
shape, opens the top, sticks his hand deep into the SCB to complete the
shaping, and then stows the sample.]<p>

<b>167:09:09</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1670911">167:09:11</a></b> Young: Okay, Houston.  The black clasts in this rock are really (pause)  black material.  It's either a very fine-grained black breccia...I'll tell you what it looks like.  It looks like that black breccia, fine-grained (garbled) that had that white clasts in it on Apollo 15.  Although here, the matrix is white, and the clasts are black.<p>

<b>167:09:54</b> England: Okay, understand.  

<blockquote><i>[John is talking about an Apollo 15 sample which, obviously, he and Tony examined in the Lunar Receiving Lab at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.  The sample in question may be 15455, a large sample Dave Scott collected at <a href="../a15/a15.spur.html#1454801" target="new">Spur Crater</a>.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;If I had it to do over again, I don't think we ought to sit there and try to describe rocks to 'em.  I think you just ought to collect rocks.  They have to trust you. See, John's sitting there wasting time trying to describe this rock to 'em.  And he could have just bagged the rock, put it in his box, and gone got another one that was different from that.  And he could have just said, you know, this is a white rock or a breccia.  You know, just a brief description of the rock.  I think all of the flights wasted a lot of time doing that.  We could have done a lot more geology, I think, if we hadn't wasting time describing rocks.  In the future, I think it's going to be important - you know, the long stays on the Moon - that we do it.  (That) we don't try to describe back to mission control.  Be well enough trained geologists to just pick it up; and they just trust you with that.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Especially on this third EVA.  On the first one, where
you were finding stuff that was very different from what the geologists expected, I suppose an argument could be made that they needed to know that you weren't finding basalts.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;To me, just looking at this TV, they could see the
distinct rock types.  There were white ones and the gray one and the black ones.  And then just go collect every one of those, you see.  And then they can write their description done when they get them into the labs.&quot;]<p>

[John has taken four &quot;before&quot; photos of this rock.  AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18619" target="new">18619</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18620" target="new">18620</a> are a down-Sun stereopair and

[Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes that future astronauts will
probably be equipped with helmet-mounted, miniature cameras which would
relay high-quality images back to Earth or the base camp.  This would
reduce the need for verbal descriptions although, obviously, the astronaut
would still need to describe any striking features or samples for
immediate consideration by support personnel.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:09:55</b> England: How large are the clasts?<p>

<b>167:09:56</b> Young: You remember that one, Houston?<p>

follows.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:09:59</b> England: Is this black breccia frothy, too, (like the
Apollo 15 breccia)?<p>

<b>167:10:03</b> Young: (Answering Tony's question about clast size)  Three
centimeters.  (Answering Tony's second question)  No, it's not frothy at
all. It's dense.<p>

<b>167:10:08</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds John, who has the sample in hand for
examination.  This is 67015, a 1.2 kg breccia which is shown in Figures 59A

Charlie gets the scoop, which John had planted to provide scale in his

east of John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:10:10</b> Young: It could be a very dense, basalt-like rock.  It is.

It's cleavaged;  I mean it looks like it has a 90-degree cleavage on it,
and I'm hard put to tell that.  That's just the way it breaks.  But it's
sure shocked.  It's too big to go in the bag, but I'm going to put it in

hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:15:24</b> Young: Or, it did before I picked it up.

rocks, about the various phases that they metamorphose through.  I don't

just changes the whole character of the rock.  He's a German (and has a)
Ph.D.  He's still at NASA, as a matter of fact.  His specialty, I think,
was shocked rocks.&quot;]<p>

<b>167:30:14</b> Duke: Oh, no.  There's some rocks.<p>

<b>167:30:18</b> Young: Lot of rocks there, Charlie!  One rake sample.

<blockquote><i>[While Charlie gets a bag ready, John does two more swaths.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:30:21</b> Duke: Okay.  One rake sample right out here, Tony.<p>

<b>167:30:25</b> England: Sounds good.<p>

<b>167:30:27</b> Duke: You can see us on the tube.<p>

<b>167:30:28</b> England: That's fine.<p>

<b>167:30:36</b> Young: Just hold still.<p>

<b>167:30:39</b> Duke: Oh, he's got some nice ones there.<p>

<b>167:30:42</b> Young: (If I can) see what I'm doing.<p>

<b>167:30:45</b> Duke: That's it.<p>

<b>167:30:46</b> Young: That got them in there?<p>

<b>167:30:47</b> Duke: Yep.<p>

<b>167:30:48</b> Young: Amazing.

</i></blockquote>

<b>167:30:51</b> Duke: And (they're) so dust covered, I can't really see what they are.  I can't believe all those bags dropped off.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John picks up the SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:31:02</b> Duke: Wait a minute;  put that one in.  Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie puts sample bag 420 in the SCB, which John is now holding at waist height.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:31:06</b> Young: (Garbled)<p>

<b>167:31:07</b> Duke: Where you want to go?<p>

<b>167:31:08</b> Young: Go on back to...

<blockquote><i>[They drop something.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:31:09</b> Duke: Oh!  I got it.  I got it, John.<p>

<b>167:31:12</b> Young: Let me get it...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets the tongs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:31:17</b> Duke: (Let me use the tongs and) save you some energy.  It
is hot out here.  (Pause)  Hey, here;  give me my bag;  I'll carry the bag.

(Taking his SCB from John)  Got it.

<blockquote><i>[John starts running toward the Rover and, after a few
seconds, Charlie follows.  They take a circuitous route to avoid the
intervening ridge and probably, a crater which is hidden from our
view.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:31:35</b> Duke: Okay, Tony...Why don't we go down halfway (back to
the Rover), John, and do another rake sample; and then go down to the big,
black rock?<p>

<b>167:31:43</b> Young: All right.   Yeah.<p>

<b><a name="1673146">167:31:46</a></b> Duke: And that'll be about 150-meter radial...(correcting himself) not radial, but concentric sampling.  (Pause)  I'm on Intermediate cooling now, Tony.<p>

<b>167:32:05</b> England: Okay, we copy that.<p>

<b>167:32:08</b> Young: I'm halfway between (Low and Intermediate).<p>

<b>167:32:13</b> England: While you two are working together, you may be
able to put the bag shoe into the core cap holder on the side of Charlie's
PLSS.  You won't be able to run that way, but, at least, it'll be some
place to hang it while you're working.

<blockquote><i>[The &quot;bag shoe&quot; may be the &quot;metal strap on
rear side of bag&quot; indicated in Figure <a href="a16mrf14-62.jpg" title="image" target="new">14-62</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission
Report.]<p>

[John and Charlie stop to do a second rake sample.  They are near the
rake sample site marked &quot;67610&quot; in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-65</a> in the Preliminary
Science Report and are partially obscured by the high-gain antenna
mast.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:32:29</b> Duke: Here, John, let me...I'll take this (pair of tongs)
down, and we'll get down in this little hollow.  If not, we'll use that for
the gnomon.  How's that for the rake sample?  Okay?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie plants the tongs and backs off to the north to take
a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;.  John is at the left side of the picture,
holding the rake.]<p>

[John runs around the tongs to look at the left side of Charlie's
PLSS.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:32:41</b> Young: Yeah.  Let me see if I can stick my bag into your
holder like...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie turns a few degrees to his right to give John a
better view.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:32:44</b> Young: Won't be able to ride with it that way, huh?<p>

<b>167:32:46</b> England: No, it'll probably pop out, but you can look at it.

<blockquote><i>[The following dialog indicates that John thinks that Tony has been talking about the sample bag dispenser and not the SCB.  He adjusts the sample bags on the fingers of his left hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:32:49</b> Duke: I'll just keep it on my...[Stops to listen]<p>

<b>167:32:50</b> Young: Keep it over your...Push it way up on your finger.<p>

<b>167:32:55</b> Duke: Yeah.  If I push it up on my middle finger, it ain't going to fall off.  I won't even know it's there.<p>

<b>167:33:01</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1673303">167:33:03</a></b> Duke: I'm going to get a down-Sun.<p>

on my back?<p>

<b>167:33:29</b> Young: Yep.<p>

<b>167:33:30</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John does a swath with the rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:33:38</b> Duke: (To himself)  (I'll) come around this way.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie moves counter-clockwise around the rake site and
takes up a position north of John.  John does a second
swath.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:33:40</b> Duke: Okay.  John's getting about two rakes; he's done two
rakes.  And he's got about 15 pebbles.

<blockquote><i>[John starts a third swath.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:33:52</b> Young: There's not any there.

<blockquote><i>[John isn't sure he has collected anything but soil and soil
clods.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:33:54</b> Duke: That's a pretty good, little sample.

<blockquote><i>[John starts to shake the dirt out of the
rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:33:57</b> Duke: There you go.  Look at that!  That's a bagful now. 
Third one was really fruitful.  (Pause)  Okay.  Turn it...There you go.

<blockquote><i>[John is using an unusual pouring technique.  He had the
rake handle in his left hand and raised the rake until he could grab the
handle with his right hand just above the rake head.  He then lowered his
right hand until the rake handle was parallel to the ground and, now, with
Charlie holding a bag at about waist height, John rotates the rake to get
the rock fragments to pour into the bag.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:33:14</b> Young: Hey, one of them had...I could see vesicles in one
of them.<p>

<b>167:34:17</b> Duke: Yeah, I could too.  Okay.  That's in 421, Tony.<p>

<b><a name="1673427">167:34:27</a></b> England: Okay, 421.  And we'd like a
soil (sample) here.

<blockquote><i>[While Charlie spins the bag closed, seals it, and stows it
in the SCB he's carrying, John backs up to get a soil sample with the
rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:34:41</b> Duke: Okay.  And getting a soil.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets a sample bag ready for the soil sample and
then sets the SCB down on the ground to his right.  The ground there is a
little higher than where he is standing and, because he doesn't have to
bend his knees while he is getting the SCB placed, he has no trouble
getting it to stand upright. The sample is <a hret="<a href="LunarSampleCompendium67601.pdf" target="new">67600</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1673450">167:34:50</a></b> Duke: My shopping bag idea would
have worked, John.  Those things are sitting right up;  you just plop them
down.<p>

<b>167:35:01</b> Young: Sure, sure it would have worked, Charlie.  That's a
good idea, too.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;You talked about the shopping bag in
</i>Moonwalker<i>, I think.  You wanted to get a bag with a big enough
bottom...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Just like a shopping bag.  You know, like you get to put
your Christmas presents in.   It would have a handle so that, when you pick
it up, it closes up and, when you let it back down, it opens up and, so,
you can just drop your samples into 'em.  It would come up to about
mid-thigh level; and you could just pick it up and off you'd go with
it.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was it a last minute idea before the flight.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, we thought about it earlier, but they didn't pay any
attention to us.  But it would have worked.&quot;]<p>

[John and Charlie discuss the shopping bag concept again at Shadow
Rock at <a href="a16.sta13.html#1683352" target="new">168:33:52</a>.]<p>

[John raises the rake, Charlie lowers the sample bag, and John starts
the pour.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:35:09</b> Duke: Okay, (sample bag) 422 for the soil sample, Tony.<p>

<b>167:35:11</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>167:35:13</b> Duke: That's enough, John.  That's a hundred grams.<p>

<b>167:35:17</b> Young: Okay.  Little bit too...<p>

<b>167:35:21</b> Duke: That's okay.<p>

<b>167:35:23</b> Young: (Joking) 100 kilograms...(Garbled) kilometers.<p>

<b>167:35:29</b> Duke: Okay, get an &quot;after&quot; of that, please,
while I pick this bag up.<p>

<b>167:35:30</b> Young: Some large number.  (Pause)
