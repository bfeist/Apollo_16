<b>167:35:37</b> Duke: How's our time going, Tony?<p>

<b>167:35:38</b> England: Oh, you're doing really fine.  We've got an extension here, and you've got about 25 minutes (remaining).

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets the tongs from John and goes off-camera to the right, around a large, foreground boulder, while John heads directly for the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:35:46</b> Young: Okay, Charlie.  Let's go back to the Rover.  Put
(means &quot;stow&quot;) your bag (meaning the hand-carried SCB) on there
and head out for the big rock.  Because you got a bag on your back, and
we'll use it.<p>

<b>167:35:59</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>167:36:03</b> England: We think that sounds like a great plan.

<blockquote><i>[<a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom and pans
right.]</i></blockquote>


<b>167:36:07</b> Duke: Didn't need...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>167:36:10</b> Young: Look at the size of that biggie (meaning House
Rock)!

<blockquote><i>[Charlie crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left,
headed for the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:36:11</b> Young: It is a biggie, isn't it.  It may be further away
than we think because...<p>

<b>167:36:17</b> Duke: No, it's not very far.  It was just right beyond you
(when he was sampling north of the Rover after <a href="a16.sta11.html#1665658" target="new">166:56:58</a>).<p>

<b>167:36:19</b> Young: Theoretically, huh?<p>

<b>167:36:20</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>167:36:21</b> Young: Like everything else around here, a couple of weeks
later (you still aren't there)...

<blockquote><i>[John is saying that things are always farther away than
they seem and that trips take longer than he expects.  Because there is no
atmospheric haze to give an impression of distance, it is very difficult to
judge the size and distance of distant objects.]<p>

[In 1835, Charles Darwin had a similar problem judging distances while traveling in the Andes east of Santiago, Chile, in March 1835:  &quot;Travelers having observed the difficulty of judging heights and distances amidst lofty mountains, have generally attributed it to the absence of objects of comparison. It appears to me, that it is fully as much owing to the transparency of the air confounding objects at different distances, and likewise partly to the novelty of an unusual degree of fatigue arising from a little exertion,&mdash;habit being thus opposed to the evidence of the senses. I am sure that this extreme clearness of the air gives a peculiar character to the landscape, all objects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane, as in a drawing or panorama. The transparency is, I presume, owing to the equable and high state of atmospheric dryness.&quot; - from The Voyage of the Beagle, p 347.]<p>

[Fendell stops the pan to
give the Backroom another look into North Ray while he waits for John and
Charlie to leave the Rover.]<p>

[House Rock can be seen at <a href="a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new">CZ.2/80.6</a> in the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-III 3
of 3</a>&quot; map in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  As indicated in
Figure <a href="a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-65</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, House Rock is about 12 meters tall, 16 by 20 meters across, and is about <a href="a16NR4618.jpg" title="image" target="new">220 meters from the Rover</a>.  At <a href="a16.sta11.html#1671738" target="new">167:17:38</a>, John only slightly underestimated the distance of House Rock from the Rover as being 150 meters.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:36:23</b> Duke: Okay.  Let's see.  I got the shovel (means
&quot;tongs&quot;).  The rake's best choice (for collecting soil and small
rocks).  And I got some bags and...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie crosses the TV field-of-view from left to right,
carrying the tongs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:36:30</b> Young: You got enough bags?  I'll leave mine here.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stops to do a rough sample bag
count.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:36:33</b> Duke: Well, I've only got...I got about 10 or so.<p>

<b>167:36:37</b> Young: Okay.  That's how many I got.<p>

<b>167:36:39</b> Duke: Okay.  Bring yours, too.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie starts running toward House Rock.  Fendell pans
right to follow but cannot pan fast enough to keep him in
view.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:36:43</b> Young: A rake and a shovel, right?<p>

<b>167:36:44</b> Duke: No, not the shovel.<p>

<b>167:36:45</b> Young: Want the rake?

<blockquote><i>[John comes into view, carrying the rake.  He does a couple
of two-footed hops as he gets up to speed.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:36:46</b> Duke: Yeah, the rake is the best way.<p>

<b>167:36:48</b> Young: That's what I got.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finally gets both John and Charlie in view and gets
a very nice sequence of both of them running at speed.  They are both using
the loping, foot-to-foot stride.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:36:49</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  We'll stop about halfway down here
and do another rake.  How's that?<p>

<b>167:36:57</b> Young: Sounds like a good idea, Charlie.<p>

<b><a name="1673700">167:37:00</a></b> Duke: (Doing his <a href="a16_wcfields.html" target="new">W.C. Fields</a> voice)  Ah, the old
footprints on the crater rim!  (Pause)  That's about halfway.  Maybe. 
(Pause)  Okay. Let me just stab (which he pronounces &quot;staub&quot;) this (pair of tongs) down here somewhere.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stops at the location marked &quot;area of 67710 (rake)&quot; in figure <a href="a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-65</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  He is about
56 meters from the TV camera and the run took about 32 seconds.  His average speed was about 6.3 km/hr.  Only <a href="../a15/a15.spur.html#1455628" target="new">Dave Scott's 7.0 km/hr run</a> back to the Rover from the Station 7 boulder was faster.]<p>

[Charlie plants the tongs to serve as a gnomon.  John arrives at the
sampling site.  The trip took him about 41 seconds and his average speed was 4.9 km/hr.  After he stops, John looks toward House
Rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:37:26</b> Young: Well, I think we'd get permanently shadowed (sample) under that big rock.  Look at that fillet on this side, Charlie.<p>

<b>167:37:31</b> Duke: Okay.  Well, we need the shovel for that.<p>

<b>167:37:33</b> Young: Get it with this here (rake)!

<blockquote><i>[John backs up to take a cross-Sun stereopair,
AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18644" target="new">18644</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18645" target="new">18645</a>.  Charlie goes around the tongs to the north to get into position to take a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:37:35</b> Duke: Okay.  Yeah, we can reach in there if...(Looking at the shadow area under House Rock)  I see what you mean.  Uh-huh.  (Pause)Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John moves in to get the sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1673752">167:37:52</a></b> Duke: Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes the down-Sun, AS16-106-
<a href="images16.html#17339" target="new">17339</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>167:37:55</b> Duke: Don't know why I'm taking that (as a) down-Sun;  (I) don't have the (color/gray-scale) chart in there.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Cross-Sun pictures show far greater detail than down-Suns, but down-Suns can provide fully lit images of the color/gray-scale on the gnomon so that the true color and albedo of the rocks can be determined.  John and Charlie have not been using the broken gnomon but, it is probably at this moment that someone in Houston realizes that the color/gray-scale can still be used.  Tony will make the suggestion at 
<a href="a16.sta13.html#1682318" target="new">168:23:18</a> at the start of the Station 13 activities.  My thanks to Brian Lawrence calling my attention to this point.]<p>

[John steps forward with the rake and Charlie takes up a position
north of him and takes a &quot;locator&quot;, AS16-106-
<a href="images16.html#17340" target="new">17340</a>.  As shown in the picture, John is standing with his knees slightly bent and the rake in his right hand.  He starts each swath by dropping the tines onto the surface slightly behind his right leg and then dragging the rake forward a half meter or so.  He does three swaths, shaking some of the dirt out after each one.  Charlie has a sample bag ready.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:38:23</b> Duke: (To Houston)  Okay.  He's getting a couple of whitish frags, and then dust-covered, gray-looking frags.  Think you got a bag full there, John.<p>

<b>167:38:34</b> Young: Yep, three scoops and a bag full.

<blockquote><i>[John raises the rake and steps toward Charlie to do the pour.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:38:36</b> Duke: It's all salted with that one white rock there. 
(Pause as John pours)  Super.  Now, okay.<p>

<b>167:38:51</b> England: We agree; it's super.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie spins the bag to close it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:38:53</b> Duke: Okay., that's in 423, Tony.<p>

<b>167:38:55</b> England: Okay, 423.<p>

<b>167:38:57</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie looks around for the hand-carried SCB.  Once he
realizes he doesn't have it anymore, he hands bag 423 to John and turns to
present his SCB.  John gives him the rake and stows the sample
bag.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:38:59</b> Young: Hang onto this, for a second.  That's going in
Charlie's SCB.<p>

<b>167:39:08</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>167:39:09</b> Duke: Try an &quot;after&quot; of that, John, and I'll get
the soil sample.

<blockquote><i>[John gets into position to take a cross-Sun
&quot;after&quot; from the south, AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18646" target="new">18646</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1673914">167:39:14</a></b> Young: There's the
&quot;after&quot;.<p>

<b>167:39:15</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie steps in to get a soil sample with the
rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:39:20</b> Duke: Man, it's hard under there, you know it?<p>

<b>167:39:22</b> Young: Yeah.  That's why the rake wouldn't go down.<p>

<b>167:39:25</b> Duke: (Garbled)<p>

<b>167:39:27</b> Young: I'm not going anywhere.  Hit it again.<p>

<b>167:39:32</b> Duke: Tony, there must be a big rock right under here.<p>

<b>167:39:35</b> Young: Yeah.  It's...

<blockquote><i>[After three attempts, Charlie doesn't have enough soil to
do a pour.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:39:37</b> Duke: I can't get the rake in, but that's just...<p>

<b>167:39:40</b> Young: Oh, look at that, Charlie.<p>

<b>167:39:41</b> Duke: I know, it's all white under here, isn't it?<p>

<b>167:39:42</b> Young: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[John steps back a meter or so and kicks the soil to see
what he might find.  Evidently, he is standing on a thicker soil patch. 
Charlie finally gets enough of a sample to do a pour and steps toward John,
who gets a bag out.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:39:47</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  Down about a centimeter or less, it's
all white.<p>

<b>167:39:54</b> England: Okay.  You feel like that's...<p>

<b>167:39:55</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>167:39:56</b> England: ...a rock surface?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie does the pour.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:39:59</b> Duke: Yeah, I think it might be a rock surface and it's
one of those friable ones, the fractured ones, and we're just chipping off
(fragments)...Here, John, I can get a soil sample from where you kicked it
up with your foot.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John backs up and Charlie gets a soil sample from the place
where John was standing.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1674017">167:40:17</a></b> Duke: Agh.  Oh, boy.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie raises the rake and pours some soil into the
bag.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:40:21</b> Young: Okay.  Get a...<p>

<b>167:40:23</b> Duke: Okay.  You want another one?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets some more soil.]</i></blockquote>


<b>167:40:34</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  That soil sample is going in
bag...(Pause)<p>

<b>167:40:41</b> Duke: 388, Tony.<p>

<b>167:40:42</b> England: Okay, 388.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John spins the bag closed and Charlie presents his
SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:40:44</b> England: And we better...<p>

<b>167:40:45</b> Duke: Okay...<p>

<b>167:40:45</b> England: ...press on for the big boulder.<p>

<b>167:40:47</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony)

<blockquote><i>[John stows the sample bag in Charlie's
SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:40:50</b> Duke: (Responding to Tony as he turns toward House Rock) 
Okay.  We're headed that way.  You get the tongs, John?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie starts running toward House Rock while John grabs
the tongs and follows.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:40:54</b> Young: Yep.  I got them.<p>

<b>167:40:55</b> Duke: I'll carry the rake.  (Pause)  Okay, Tony;  my guess
is that most of these rocks around here are extremely shocked.  (Pause)<p>

<b>167:41:09</b> Young: (Garbled)  (Pause)<p>

<b>167:41:14</b> Duke: All these in this area look the same.  Hope that
thing is not coming off.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie reaches a slope change and begins to go downslope
toward House Rock.  John stops and looks at a partially buried boulder
which is just east of their path.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:41:21</b> Young: Yeah.  In the sunlight, Houston, this white rock
has sort of a greenish hue to it, this white rock breccia.  Which is what
all this is we're walking on right now, is this white rock breccia that
Charlie chipped out of...(Pause as John starts running again)  And I guess
this is probably the second layer up.  I would reckon that, if we could see
to the bottom (of North Ray), we could say for sure if this big black rock
is right out of the bottom.  But my guess, from the old (pre-mission)
photographs, it probably is.<p>

<b>167:41:59</b> England: Okay.  That sounds like a good guess.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stops  and looks up at House Rock.  He is probably
near the large fragment known as Outhouse Rock, which is just south of the
main boulder as shown in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-65</a> in the Preliminary Science
Report.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:42:00</b> Young: Look.  See this rock right here, Charlie?!<p>

<b>167:42:03</b> Duke: Look at the size of that rock!<p>

<b>167:42:07</b> England: We can see.<p>

<b>167:42:10</b> Duke: The closer I get to it, the bigger it is.<p>

<b>167:42:13</b> Young: Yeah, but look at the permanent shadowed part,
Charlie.<p>

<b>167:42:14</b> Duke: On this (east) side over here?

<blockquote><i>[John reaches the southern face of Outhouse
Rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:42:15</b> Young: Yeah.  No, right here on this one.  See that
shadow?  That must be permanent.<p>

<b>167:42:20</b> Duke: No, I bet you it's not.  (Pointing west) The Sun's
going (to go) down over there, John.<p>

<b>167:42:25</b> Young: Yeah, you're right.<p>

<b>167:42:26</b> Duke: See.  (Pause)  If you come back here in two weeks,
and...(rethinking about where the Sun will be in two weeks) it'll be dark! 
(Laughs)  Well, maybe a week, and you'd have Sun over there.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes around the east side of Outhouse Rock and John
follows.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:42:39</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, this is a very blocky area here.<p>

<b>167:42:43</b> Young: And look at the shape of that rascal.<p>

<b>167:42:50</b> Duke: Yeah.  (Pause)  We don't see any glass, though,
particularly.<p>

<b>167:42:57</b> Young: No, I guess I'd have to call this a black matrix
(breccia).  Looks like the matrix has reversed itself now, it's all black
matrix.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is standing ten meters or so east of House Rock and
has all but disappeared from view.  We get only an occasional glimpse of
the top of his helmet and OPS.  John is still visible near the east side of
the boulder but, because of his distance from the Rover, even at maximum
zoom it is difficult to tell what he is doing.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:43:11</b> Duke: Well, Tony, that's your &quot;house rock&quot; right
there.<p>

<b>167:43:14</b> England: Very good.<p>

<b>167:43:15</b> Young: Charlie, don't get too near the edge of that thing, it falls off.  Look over at your right;  it falls off pretty good.<p>

<b><a name="1674321">167:43:21</a></b> Duke: Yeah, I know.  I'm gonna just take a little stereo here.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes a sequence of four pictures of the base of House Rock, AS16-106-

sequence a <a href="a16-17341-4.jpg" title="image" target="new">partial pan</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:43:30</b> Young: Okay, now we had to come down a pretty good slope to get to this rock, so we may have to leave early to get back.<p>

<b>167:43:35</b> Duke: Yes, sir.  I agree.<p>

<b>167:43:36</b> England: You've got about 17 minutes before you'll have to drive off, so we'll have to hustle with this.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John disappears behind Outhouse Rock.  He reappears briefly, probably having made his way around some boulders but then, as Charlie joins him, they both go out of sight.]</i></blockquote>

<b>167:43:52</b> Duke: Okay, John.  Here's a...(Pause)  Looky here.  Can we
whack with the...(Pause)  See, look at that.  See, it's glass coated, and
this is just fractured off.  We could pull that off.  Big chunks of that'll
come right off.<p>

<b>167:44:14</b> Young: Right.<p>

<b>167:44:15</b> Duke: And it's got a bluish tint to it, doesn't it?<p>

<b>167:44:19</b> Young: It does.<p>

<b>167:44:20</b> Duke: It doesn't look like the (pause) real basalt.<p>

<b>167:44:24</b> Young: Look at that shatter cone right there, Charlie.
I'll be darned.<p>

<b>167:44:28</b> Duke: It is.  Yeah.<p>

<b>167:44:29</b> Young: I'm sure.<p>

<b>167:44:30</b> Duke: Right there.<p>

<b>167:44:31</b> England: Outstanding.<p>

<b>167:44:32</b> Young: Maybe there's two of them.<p>

<b><a name="1674433">167:44:33</a></b> Duke: Yeah.  Put your tongs up there, and I'll get a close-up...<p>

<b>167:44:36</b> England: Yeah, make a good picture of that one for Muehlberger.<p>

<b>167:44:39</b> Young: Well, that settles that, huh?.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie used the foot-to-foot, loping stride all the way
back to the Rover,   Making an allowance for the detours he had to make
around boulders and craters near House Rock, he ran about 145 meters and
made the trip in 2 minutes 40 seconds.  His average speed was 3.3 km/hr and
the relatively slow pace was probably due to the fact that he was running
upslope.  John also used the loping stride and covered about 115 meters
before he stopped.  His average speed was about 2.6 km/hr.]<p>

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat.  He turns to his right and takes the scoop east of the Rover to find another padded-bag sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:00:51</b> Young: Okay; but get a smaller one, Charlie.<p>

<b>168:00:52</b> Duke: I am.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[In Houston, Flight Director Pete Frank is eager to get John and Charlie on the Rover and headed for the next station.  &quot;EVA&quot;, the spokesman for the group keeping track of EVA tasks, reminds him that Charlie needs to change DAC magazines before they leave.]<p>

their hardness.]</i></blockquote>

can remove the used magazine.  As the magazine comes into view, Charlie
sees that the film use indicator has not changed.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:03:09</b> Duke: Rats.  (Pause)  Guess what?  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie removes the used magazine and hits it several times
with his right hand to try to dislodge the indicator.  Apparently, it
moves.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:03:36</b> Duke: Okay.  I thought that thing hadn't run, Tony, but
the little ball had just stuck.  (Expressing relief)  Whew!<p>

<b>168:03:42</b> England: Okay.  Understand.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie reaches across the Rover seats, probably so he can toss the used magazine into the CDR seatpan.  The following dialog suggests he misses the seatpan so that the magazine falls to the ground on John's side of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:03:43</b> Duke: Oh, John!

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets the new magazine.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:03:46</b> Young: What was it?<p>

<b>168:04:39</b> Young: Now, Houston, the Velcro came off both those bags; and we weren't able to put them tight like they are supposed to be.

<blockquote><i>[Section 14.4.10 in the ( <a href="A16_MissionReport.pdf" target="new">18 Mb PDF</a> ) Apollo 16 Mission Report ( <a href="A16_MissionReport.pdf" target="new">18 Mb PDF</a> ) contains the following: &quot;When the crew wrapped the Velcro strap around each of the padded sample bags to further secure them, the Velcro attachment patches came off the bags and the straps were ineffective.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;A 20-inch-long wrap-around Velcro pile strap is provided to hold the bag closed in addition to the usual tab closure ( <a href="a16mrf14-64.jpg" title="drawing" target="new">fig. 14-64</a> ). One end of the strap is bonded with a fluorel adhesive to an etched Teflon patch which is heat-sealed to the Teflon bag. A Velcro hook patch is bonded to the etched Teflon patch with a pressure-sensltlve adhesive and provides the attach point for the other end of the strap. The peel strength of the pressure-sensitlve bond was less than that of the Velcro pile-to-hook connections. Consequently, when the Velcro strap was adjusted to the proper tension, the hook patch came off the bag.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;The problem resulted from using the improper bond material for the Velcro hook patch. This equipment is not scheduled for another flight and no further action is required. This anomaly is closed.&quot;]<p>

[Charlie reaches between the seats, grabs the tongs, and goes to the back of the Rover to stow the scoop and
tongs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:04:46</b> England: Okay.  We understand.  (Pause)  And they go under your seat, John.<p>

<b>168:05:01</b> Young: We put them in an SCB.  You don't want them in an
SCB?<p>

<b>168:05:05</b> Duke: No.  They don't.  They want...

<blockquote><i>[Note that the gate on the rear of the Rover is open and that Charlie stows the scoop and tongs on the inside face of the Hand Tool Carrier (HTC).]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:05:06</b> Young: I think with the Velcro off of them, you can't hardly zee them.  I think we ought to leave them in the SCB.  If they get in there (in the CDR seatpan) with the film, we will be in trouble.

<blockquote><i>[John's use of 'zee' is a reference to the way the individual sample bags were sealed, by folding the top of the bag down a time or two then bending the metal tab on one side of the bag across the front of the bag and the other tab across the back.  Viewed from the top, the bend metal strip could be though of as forming the letter 'Z'. John is using 'zee' to mean 'seal'.]<p>

[Charlie returns to the LMP seat while John comes into view at the back of the Rover and stows the second pair of
tongs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:05:15</b> England: Okay, fine.  Let's just leave them in the SCB.<p>

<b>168:05:18</b> Young: (Garbled) (Stops to listen)  Okay.  (Pause)

<b>168:05:31</b> Young: Okay, Charlie.  I'm gonna close the HTC.<p>

<b>168:05:33</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  They're right on the top there,
Tony, in number 6; and there's no rocks on top of them.  I think they'll be
fine.<p>

<b>168:05:49</b> England: Okay.  Good show.<p>

<b><a name="1680552">168:05:52</a></b> Duke: Hey, John.  Let me put number 7 on your (PLSS)...Try
it again on your side.<p>

<b>168:05:56</b> Young: Charlie, we're just going to lose it.  Why don't we
just leave it under the seat?<p>

<b>168:05:59</b> Duke: I can't get it under my seat.<p>

<b>168:06:02</b> Young: Yeah, but it's full of nice things.<p>

<b>168:06:04</b> Duke: Okay.  Well, I'll hold it in my hand then.  I
don't...<p>

<b>168:06:09</b> Young: Want to see if you can put it on?<p>

<b>168:06:11</b> Duke: Well, if you move away a little bit, yeah.  A little
bit more.  Okay.  That's fine.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell stops to look at the north wall of North
