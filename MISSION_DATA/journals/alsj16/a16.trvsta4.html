<blockquote><i>[Activities during the traverse from the LM to Station 4 are detailed in Brian McInall's <a href="A16_EVA_2_LM_to_STA_4_Traverse_Map-LROC_M175179080LR_Apr_2018.jpg" title="map" target="new">Planimetric Map</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:31:21</b> Duke: Okay.  DAC's coming on.  (Grunting as he reaches forward)  Mark.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;How hard was it to reach forward to get the DAC?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It wasn't so far.  It was just up here - left arm up - and
getting you arm up was the tough part.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So you didn't have to lean forward and pull your PLSS off of the seat.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Not that I remember.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:31:29</b> Young: Okay, give me that first heading again, Charlie.<p>

<b>143:31:31</b> Duke: 164.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As indicated on the EVA-II <a href="a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new">contour map</a>, which will be Charlie's primary reference during the traverse, the first segment of the drive had been planned to be 1.3 km on a heading on 173.  Because John landed farther north and west than planned, Tony gave them a new heading of 162 at <a href="a16.eva2prelim.html#1432520" target="new">143:25:20</a>, which Charlie seems to have mis-remembered.  Over a distance of a kilometer, the difference is a trivial 35 meters.]<p>

[Brian McInall has created a map (<a href="a16LM-toStation4TraverseMapLROC-M175179080LR_May2016.jpg" title="image" target="new">11 Mb</a>) of the traverse from the LM to Station 4, using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) image M175179080LR as the base and adding Rover locations derived from the Hasselblad and Data Acquisition Camera (DAC; 16-mm motion picture) images taken during the drive, and from occasional segments of Rover tracks visible in the LROC image.]<p>

[The complete DAC footage for the drive to Station 4 is available on the Apollo 16 DVD set available from Spacecraft films and from a 31 minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STvUNSoIlsg" target="new">YouTube clip</a> prepared by Diego Trystero.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1433140">143:31:40</a></b> Duke: Okay, Houston.  We're underway.<p>

<b>143:31:44</b> England: Okay, good show.  And even with all of that extra there, you're only leaving 2 minutes late.  Outstanding.<p>

<b>143:31:55</b> Young: You're kidding.  (Joking) We must have forgot
something, Charlie.  (Laughing)  That's all I got to say...<p>

<b><a name="1433202">143:32:02</a></b> Duke: Well, everything's running.  Okay.  Tony, as we cross out to the west here - or south - we see a lot of these black rocks with the white phenocrysts.

</i></blockquote>

<b>143:32:17</b> Young: Also, we see big white rocks with black
phenocrysts.  How about that, Houston?  Black glass, I mean.  Excuse me. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>143:32:32</b> Duke: Okay.  We've got a great view of all the way into Stone.  We're right up on a ridge here, Tony.  We're at 10 degrees bearing, 1.1 range.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has mis-spoken.  The range to the LM is 0.1 km.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:32:40</b> Duke: There's a 1-meter boulder to the right that's very angular, that's just as we've already described:  the black with the whitish inclusion.  We can see all the way to the base of 
<a href="a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">Stone Mountain and Survey Ridge</a>.  There are some secondaries around.  The terrain is covered with about 3 percent of the surface with cobbles up to 15 centimeters.  A couple of indurated little secondaries...

<blockquote><i>[&quot;Cobbles&quot; are pieces of rock between about 6.4 cm to 25.6 cm.]<p>

[&quot;Secondaries&quot; are craters formed by ejecta from other impacts; and an &quot;indurated secondary&quot; is a secondary which produced ejecta in the form of fragments of compressed regolith.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Do you have any recollection of how Survey looked.  I gather it was well up off the local terrain.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, it was visible.  We were sort of going downslope and it was just a big ridge up there.  You know, it looked like we were going to have to go up like a rolling hill.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Similar size to the ones around the LM?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Survey was bigger, taller.&quot;]<p>

[We then looked at Figure 6-4 ( <a href="a16psrf6-4.jpg" title="image" target="new">648k</a> ) in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  The climb
up Survey Ridge began when they entered the light-colored area northwest of the 'S' in Survey and reached the summit when they were about
even with the &quot;t&quot; in Sunset.  John then turned toward the
southwest and drove along the ridge crest.  What is unusual about this
situation is that the shadows in the large craters clearly show that this
picture was taken from the Command Module when the Sun was still relatively low in the eastern sky.  Consequently, a ridge should be brighter on the east and darker on the west.  The fact that Survey Ridge is brighter on the west is probably the result of South Ray ejecta preferentially impacting that side of the ridge.]<p>

Paper.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:33:17</b> England: And Charlie, verify the DAC is on.<p>

<b>143:33:19</b> Duke: ...that are a meter or so (in diameter)...(Stops to listen)  Yeah, I called DAC on.<p>

<b>143:33:25</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie probably reaches up to the DAC and, in process,
knocks John's arm.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:33:27</b> Young: Uh-oh, Charlie.  Charlie.<p>

<b>143:33:28</b> Duke: (To Houston) I feel it running.<p>

<b>143:33:30</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>143:33:32</b> Duke: Okay.  Now, Tony, we're going down an incline -
downslope - at 356 at 0.3, that is about...What would you say, about a 5-degree slope, John?  And the boulder population and the cobble population has picked up over here to about 10 percent, I'd say.<p>

<b>143:34:00</b> England: Okay.  There were those mounds mapped over at Phantom area.  Can you see those...<p>

<b>143:34:02</b> Duke: I think we're just now coming up on...(Stops to
listen)  The mounds mapped where?<p>

<b>143:34:10</b> England: In the area of Phantom Crater.  That will be to your left at about...It will be about 10 o'clock now.

<blockquote><i>[Phantom Crater is east of the outbound track at

surrounding Phantom.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:34:18</b> Duke: No.  Phantom Crater's over a ridge.  I think we're coming by <a href="a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">WC</a>, is what we're really coming by.  Off to our 1 o'clock...Make it 3 o'clock now, 350 at 0.3.<p>

<b>143:34:29</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>143:34:32</b> Young: I think you're right, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[John landed near CB.1/80.5 and a LM bearing/range of 350/0.3 would put them near <a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">BZ.6/80.8</a>.  They are probably passing northern Double Spot, rather than WC.  The latter is at BX.8/79.9.  Charlie's next picture is <a href="images16.html#17876" target="new">AS16-110-17876</a>.

<b>143:34:35</b> Duke: Okay.  The largest blocks we see are a meter.  The regolith seems to be loosely compacted, much like the regolith  over at the...which is characteristic of all of the Cayley here.  Most of the rocks are angular to subrounded.<p>

<b>143:34:59</b> England: Okay.  Do you feel you're still in that ray? <p>

<b>143:35:02</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony) still in this ray.<p>

<b>143:35:05</b> LM Crew: (Answering Tony)  Yep.<p>

<b>143:35:07</b> Young: Just covered with blocks and holes, Houston.<p>

<b>143:35:10</b> England: Okay.  We copy.<p>

<b>143:35:12</b> Duke: Lots of secondaries, Tony.<p>

<b>143:35:15</b> Young: Charlie, what are we shooting for?<p>

<b>143:35:18</b> Duke: Well, we're supposed to be one seven...Let's
see...<p>

<b>143:35:24</b> England: Okay.  The heading on the first leg is 162.<p>

<b>143:35:25</b> Young: Houston, can you give us a range and first
heading...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>143:35:32</b> Duke: For 1.3.

<blockquote><i>[As indicated on the 
<a href="a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new">contour map</a>, on the first leg they had planned to drive on a
heading of 173 - revised to 162 - for 1.3 km until they reach Survey Ridge.  As Charlie mentions in a moment, they will make a turn to the southwest once they get up on Survey Ridge and will drive along the ridge crest for a couple of hundred meters.  As shown on the 
<a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">photographic map</a> printed on the reverse of the contour map, they are planning to
make the turn near BT.0/82.1.  The bearing and range at that point was to have been 353/1.3 but, because the actual landing site is displaced from the planned spot, the bearing and range will be about
350/1.6.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:35:34</b> Duke: Okay, we've got 0.6 now.  When we get there, we should be 353 at 1.3.  We're traveling a little bit east.  I think if
you...Now you look like you're headed just about for our spot.  See Survey
Ridge down there?<p>

<b>143:35:51</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>143:35:53</b> Duke: Hey, this is a great place to keep this map.  Wedge it in that camera.  Yeow!  Whooo!  Man, that was a great big skid.  We're doing 10 clicks, Tony.<p>

<b>143:36:06</b> England: Outstanding.

<blockquote><i>[The back end of the Rover may have broken out as the result of a turn to avoid a crater.  McInall indates that the skid occured at about BY.7/81.2. Charlie's next picture is <a href="images16.html#17877" target="new">AS16-110-17877</a>.]<p>

[With regard to the skid and the <a href="a16_1433553GreatBigSkid.jpg" title="image" target="new">accompanying LRV Visible Tracks inset</a>, McInall writes &quot;The yellow traverse track through this area (as with all areas of the traverse) was created in reference to the 16mm DAC footage. The version of the footage that I have (from the Spacecraft Films Apollo 16 DVD set, but also available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STvUNSoIlsg" target="new">YouTube</a>) has the audio nicely synched up for the most part. At the moment of the great big skid, you can visually see that the rover rotated counter clockwise to face more eastward. Unfortunately we don't see the tracks reflecting this. &quot;]<p>

[On the audio track, Charlie's &quot;Yeow!&quot; comes at 4:51 while, in the DAC sequence, there is a sudden discontinuity in the Rover heading at 4:56.]<p>

[McInall &quot;The width of a rover wheel track is right at the limit of resolution in the LROC imagery (0.4 meters /pix). That and lighting angle along with surface slope etc. probably all play a role in how and where we can see the tracks. Added to this, I believe that in places where we do see the tracks, it's either because for some reason the wheels were digging in and kicking up dust and there by lowering the albedo, resulting in dark “tracks”, or in other circumstances the wheels were packing down the surface in the right area such that with the right lighting angle was causing those tracks to reflect a higher albedo resulting in the appearance of light tracks. The traverse to Station 1 is (or will be) a good example of light (high albedo) tracks. Almost all of the traverse to Station 1 and back is visible in the LROC imagery, yet for EVA 2 this whole southern traverse barely shows any rack visibility.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;In regards to the great big skid then, I think what we can see is that the dark patch just to the right of the bottom white arrow in the LROC inset, represents the spray of dust that might have darkened or lowered the albedo in that immediate vicinity. In other words we don't see the tracks but we do see the effect of the skid in terms of the dust that was sprayed out.&quot;] 

[&quot;That being said, this particular LROC inset is probably one of the poorest example of visible tracks. However the first LROC inset south of Survey Ridge is a good example of both low and high albedo tracks which occur together over a distance of just 75 meters. There was no skid at this point but if memory serves John Young was reacting in a humorous way to the driving conditions at this point (<a href="#1435425" target="new">143:54:25</a>). To which Charlie says &quot;I love it...&quot; Anyway this is mostly speculation but partially based on the many hours spent staring at this wonderful imagery.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:36:07</b> Duke: Still down about a 2-to 3-degree slope now.  Old
Barney's really driving this beauty.

</i></blockquote>

<b>143:36:17</b> England: Do you have an Amps at max speed?<p>

<b>143:36:25</b> Duke: I can't tell you, I'm sitting in Volts right now.<p>

<b>143:36:29</b> England: Okay.  Fine.

<blockquote><i>[As shown in Figure 
<a href="../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new">1-22</a> in the 
<a href="../lrvhand.html" target="new">LRV Operations Handbook</a>,
there is a switch near the middle of the <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">console</a> which allows the crew to
read either battery voltage or current (Amps).  Apparently, Charlie is unable to reach forward far enough to change the switch
setting.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:36:30</b> Duke: Tony, an observation here: the dust-covered rocks are mostly rounded.  The angular rocks seem to be free of dust.

<blockquote><i>[Angular rocks are probably fresh ejecta, possibly from South Ray, while the rounded rocks are older and have been subject to more &quot;weathering&quot; due to micrometeorite impacts.  Charlie's observation that the dust-covered rocks are the rounded ones suggest that the dust covering may also have been due to the South Ray event.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:36:44</b> Young: And there sure are a lot of rocks, Houston.<p>

<b>143:36:50</b> Duke: Still as we described (earlier):  cobbly.  Cobble size is still the same.  Maybe 10 percent of the surface, now.  (Pause)  Tony, we forgot to say it, but we're starting out with the correct (Hasselblad) magazines, as per checklist.<p>

<b>143:37:10</b> England: Okay.  Good show.<p>

<b>143:37:15</b> Duke: Lot easier driving down here, isn't it, John?  Not any real big craters.  Lot of subdued...<p>

<b>143:37:22</b> Young: Well, it's not any easier; it's just that you can
see what you're doing (driving cross-Sun).<p>

<b>143:37:25</b> Duke: Yeah.  But it didn't seem to be as rough, is what I thought.  Okay.  We're at 348 at 0.8 now, Tony.  (Pause)  Still in indurated secondaries.

<blockquote><i>[They are near <a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">BX.2/81.3</a>.  Charlie's next traverse photo will be AS16-110-<a href="images16.html#17883" target="new">17883</a>.

<b>143:37:46</b> England: Okay.  You should be about halfway to Survey (Ridge).<p>

<b>143:37:52</b> Duke: Okay.  Yeah, we see Survey right up there.  That was properly mapped.  (Pause) Most of the secondaries - or the craters - here, Tony, are in the meter size.  Some of the larger ones may be 5 meters.  Okay.  It's getting a lot rougher now.  A lot more hummocky: at 346 at 0.9.  Slowing down to about 6 clicks.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[They are near <a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">BW.7/81.6</a>.  Charlie's next traverse photo will be AS16-110-<a href="images16.html#17884" target="new">17884</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:38:31</b> Duke: That's gonna be a steep slope up there, John.<p>

<b>143:38:34</b> Young: I believe it is, Charlie.<p>

<b>143:38:35</b> Duke: Up Stone.  (Pause)  Okay.  We're looking for 35...About...Okay, at 1.3 clicks, we should be on Survey at around 35(0) or so.  Looks like that's Survey dead ahead, to me.<p>

<b>143:38:54</b> Young: Looks like to me.  (Pause)<p>

<b>143:39:02</b> Duke: Tony, apparently this ray is pretty extensive.  We haven't got out of this cobble field yet, and we're now 1.0 at 348
(<a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">BW.2/81.5</a>).  And the percentages (meaning the fraction of the surface covered with small rocks) are just exactly the same.  Characteristics of the regolith are identical; and it still appears loosely compacted.  Almost like a freshly-plowed field that's been rained on.<p>

<b>143:39:38</b> England: Okay.  We understand that.

a CSM pan-camera frame which shows the LM and numerous large boulders on
the rims of South Ray, North Ray, and other fresh craters, there are no
visible boulders east of their current location.  The LM is seven meters
tall and, at the time the pan-camera frame was taken, the sunlit east face
of the spacecraft and its shadow are clearly visible.  Consequently, a
5-meter boulder east of their present location would also be visible.  This
implies that the rock is comparable in size to the boulder near the ALSEP,
which is about 2 meters in size and is not visible in the blow-up.  Even
though Charlie has overestimated the size and distance, he seems to have
taken a step toward eliminating obscuration as an element in the estimation
processes.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:56:11</b> Duke: I can't give you any new words, Tony.  The regolith
is still the same.  We're still in a block field.  We're just about to
start upslope here.  Have we been climbing, John?<p>

<b>143:56:25</b> Young: Nope.<p>

<b>143:56:26</b> Duke: Look at that pitch meter.

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The pitch
meter broke off almost before we started up Stone Mountain.  The pitch
meter face fell off.  The only way you'd know it is that you'd only be
making 8 kilometers per hour (but) you'd have the thing fire-walled.  On a
level, you could do 11 clicks; and, downhill, if you took the power off,
you could do as much as you wanted to, if you let the thing go.&quot;]<p>

[See, also, the discussion about the pitch meter at <a href="#1440820" target="new">144:08:20</a>.]<p>

[Training photo <a href="ap16-KSC-71PC-743.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-71PC-743</a> gives us a view of the meter, which is mounted on the outside of the console on John's side of the Rover.  In the picture, it is in the pitch position.  The dialog indicates that Charlie could read the meter from his seat.  See, also, training photo <a href="ap16-s72-33685.jpg" title="image" target="new">S72-33685</a>.]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Going upslope, the pitch meter needle was working and it was pegged at the top.&quot;]<p>

[This indicates they were climbing more than a 20-degree slope.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Charlie said it was pegged and I said, 'Oh, Charlie'.  I didn't believe this.  I didn't feel as if I had a sensation that it had been pegged.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;On these local slopes that
got steep, you really had no sensation of climbing a steep slope (in the
Rover).  But you really knew it when you were going downslope (on) a steep
slope.  (Going uphill), the thing could have gradually increased to a
25-degree slope and I don't think we would have realized it.&quot;]<p>

[The other Rover crews reported similar sensations.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I tell you one thing, we
couldn't have gotten out and worked on a 20-degree slope.  You just can't
handle it.  Although, I think maybe we did when we were standing in that
crater (at Station 5).  We might have been on a 20-degree slope.&quot;]<p>

too.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[The geologists would like to get samples of the Stone Mountain bedrock - known formally as the Descartes Formation.  The surface
is undoubtedly covered with South Ray ejecta and the best place to sample
the Descartes would be on the rim of a fresh crater large enough to have
punched through the South Ray material.  In other words, they are looking
for something similar to Apollo 15 Spur Crater, which was on the flank of
Mount Hadley Delta.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Jones - Does this mean that John's getting the wheels up on...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Up on some of the blocks, yeah.  If I remember, they were more subdued blocks, though.  I mean, it wasn't a boulder sticking up a meter, but the width and breadth of the block was a meter.  It wasn't any problem.  That car just really moved over all that kind of surface.  I think we were probably ten or twelve inches off the surface - that's how much clearance we had.  Maybe a little bit more than that.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;14 inches is the number that sticks in my mind.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, maybe.  So the rock couldn't stick up more than 14 inches or we'd drag the bottom - like we did a couple of times.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1440729">144:07:29</a></b> Duke: Okay.  Just about got it.  Just about...Great, great, super!  Okay.  We're parked, Tony, (<a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">reading the console</a>) at (LRV) heading 270, (bearing to the LM) 354, (distance driven) 5.2, (range to the LM) 4.1, 100, 100, (Pause), 70, 68, 68,  (Pause), 85, 100, off-scale...(correcting himself) about 200, 200, and 200, 200.  And I'll give you the readings.

<blockquote><i>[A bearing and range of 354/4.1 corresponds to a map location of <a href="a16.lsp269.jpg" title="image" target="new">BG.8/82.7</a>, which is a position near the west rim of <a href="a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">Cinco 'b'</a>.  Analysis presented in the 1981 USGS Apollo 16 Proessional Paper, such as <a href="SouthboundToStation4LROC - M175179080LR.jpg" title="image" target="new">McInall's map of the approach to Station 4</a>,  shows that they actually parked about 80 meters west of the center of Cinco 'a', or at about BF.9/82.5.  The difference between the indicated and actual locations is about 185 meters.  Note that they have driven about 5.2 kilometers in order to achieve a range to the LM of 4.1.  This is a higher ratio - or 'wander factor' - than many other Apollo Rover traverses and is due, in part, to the Survey Ridge excursion.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:08:09</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  We're in real bad shape because our vehicle attitude indicator in roll (is broken)...That's why you thought it was so pitched.  The thing is broken, Charlie.<p>

<b>144:08:19</b> Duke: It is.  Yeah.<p>

<b><a name="1440820">144:08:20</a></b> Young: It's broken.  See, it's flipped off up there.  But as soon as we get the TV up, anybody would be able to tell where we're at.

<blockquote><i>[As is shown in 
<a href="../lrvf1-26.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 1-26</a> from the 
<a href="../lrvhand.html" target="new">LRV Operations Handbook</a>, the pitch/roll indicator was mounted on a pivot on the left side of the console.  During traverses, the pitch scale was normally in view but, when John parked the vehicle, he would re-position the indicator to show vehicle roll.]<p>

[The following is taken from the Apollo 16 Mission Report - &quot;During the second EVA, the crew reported that the LRV pitch-attitude-indicator scale had fallen off.  The indicator provides a vehicle pitch reference between plus and minus 20 degrees.  The loose pitch scale did not impact the mission because the pointer for the indicator continued to work properly and the crew could adequately estimate the vehicle pitch from the pointer position.  The pitch-attitude-indicator scale is bonded to a bracket (Fig. 14-81) which is attached to the indicator case.  The scale is constructed of 2024T3 aluminum and the bracket is 6/6 nylon.  A comparison of the coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials indicate approximately a 4-to-1 ratio for nylon-to-aluminum.  With this expansion ratio, stress factors of safety for an ideal bond are 3 and 4 and temperatures of minus 100-degrees F and plus 250 degrees F, respectively.  Although a review of the bonding procedures did not reveal any problems, a flaw most probably existed in the bond, and this allowed stress buildup which caused the scale to become unbonded.  The crew experienced no difficulty in estimating the pitch angle after the scale became unbonded.  The back of the meter case must be machined off to gain access to the scale, and special handling permits must be obtained before working on the meter because of the radioactive materials within the case.  For these reasons, no hardware changes will be made for Apollo 17.&quot;]<p>

[No problems were experienced with the Apollo 17 indicator.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:08:26</b> England: Okay.  On the SSD (Sun Shadow Device), can you estimate a roll well enough for an update?

<blockquote><i>[As shown in Figure 
<a href="../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new">1-22</a> from 
<a href="../lrvhand.html" target="new">LRV Operations Handbook</a>, the Sun Shadow Device was mounted between the <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">heading and speed indicators</a>.  With the LRV parked facing west, the crew could raise the SSD as shown in 
<a href="../lrvf1-27.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 1-27</a> and read the position on the scale of the shadow cast by the gnomon.  This reading, combined with the known position of the Sun in the sky and the vehicle roll and pitch, allowed determination of the true heading. Don McMillan has provided an animation (<a href="../sundevice_v3.mov" title="animation" target="new">2 Mb</a>) of the Sun Shadow device being put in position to provide a reading.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[During the second Apollo 15 EVA, Dave Scott and Jim Irwin stopped at a boulder at Station 6a on the flank of Mt. Hadley Delta but, because the boulder was on a slope of about 15 degrees and was resting on a very soft surface, they felt they were in a precarious position and only spent a few minutes before moving downslope to Spur Crater where they were able to park the Rover on a level spot on the downslope rim.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you have discussions with the 15 guys about working on slopes and parking the Rover.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember specific discussions; but I'm sure we did.  Those discussions probably influenced us about where to park.  We didn't want to park with the Rover on a steep slope because it's so hard to get out and to walk.  So we wanted to get a bench - a fairly level place to work.  If you're on a fairly level place, you can work pretty good.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
