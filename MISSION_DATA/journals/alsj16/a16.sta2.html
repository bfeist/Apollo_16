<b>124:21:52</b> Duke: (Probably looking at  his checklist) Okay;  pan one, up on Spook crater.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie will take a pan from the rim of Spook as indicated by the circled &quot;1&quot; on 
<a href="a16.lmpev124.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-24</a>.  
<a href="a16.lmpev125.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-25</a> lists the planned tasks for both of them.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:21:56</b> Young: I can't believe it, Charlie.<p>

<b>124:22:02</b> Duke: What?  You did it again?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's first guess is that John has pulled out his
purge-valve locking pin, which is true.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1242203">124:22:03</a></b> Young: My hammer just got hung up in the instrument panel.<p>

<b>124:22:05</b> Duke: Oh, I know it.  I saw that.  It was on those stanchions there.  I'm sorry, I should have said something to you.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:22:15</b> Young: Okay; well, I won't need it (meaning the hammer).  Do you need it? <p>

<b>124:22:17</b> Duke: No.<p>

<b><a name="1242218">124:22:18</a></b> Young: Put it in the seat.  (Do you) want to put this thing (meaning his purge-valve pin) back in one more time.  Charlie?<p>

<b>124:22:26</b> Duke: You're kidding!<p>

<b>124:22:27</b> Young: No.<p>

<b>124:22:28</b> Duke: Okay, I'll put it in.  Come on over.  You start the LPM (Lunar Portable Magnetometer), and I'll be over in just a minute.<p>

<b>124:22:32</b> Young: Okay, I'll get the (high-gain) antenna up. <p>

<b>124:22:36</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[The purge-valve-pin problem is discussed following 
<a href="a16.debrief1.html#1284606" target="new">128:46:06</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>124:22:40</b> England: Okay, Charlie.  Are you on a ray there?  And are the blocks angular.<p>

<b>124:22:48</b> Duke: The blocks are angular, but they are definitely
coming out of Buster.<p>

<b>124:22:50</b> England: Okay, very good.  (Brief Static)<p>

<b>124:22:56</b> Duke: (Lost in the static, which then clears)  dissipate
very quickly.  In fact, they don't even come to Flag (probably means
Spook).

<blockquote><i>[What Charlie is saying is that the blocky ejecta from
Buster thins out as you move away from the rim and that none of it reaches the rim of Spook.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:23:03</b> England: Okay.  Hey, we've got a TV picture!

<blockquote><i>[TV on.  Smoky Mountain can be seen on the northern horizon with Kiva Crater on its flank.  As can be seen in Figure 6-4 ( <a href="a16psrf6-4.jpg" title="image" target="new">648k</a> ) from the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, Kiva is about 900 meters in diameter and is about 4 km from Station 2.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:23:05</b> Young: Buster is a real impressive crater.  (Brief
static)<p>

<b>124:23:20</b> Duke: John?  Old Orion!<p>

<b>124:23:23</b> Young: Where is it, Charlie?<p>

<b>124:23:25</b> Duke: Right...Just to the left...Right under the Sun, as a matter of fact.<p>

<b>124:23:29</b> Young: By golly, we did park it in the right place!<p>

<b><a name="1242334">124:23:34</a></b> Duke: I think we did!

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is probably taking his <a href="images16.html#17811-27" target="new">first Station 2 pan</a> , which consists of frames AS16-109-
<a href="images16.html#17811" target="new">17811</a> to 
<a href="images16.html#17827" target="new">17827</a>.]<p>

[Frames 
<a href="images16.html#17813" target="new">17813</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#17814" target="new">17814</a> show John working at the front of the Rover.]<p>

[Frame 
<a href="images16.html#17820" target="new">17820</a> is the up-Sun picture and, although Charlie says he can see the LM, it is not easy to pick out in the Hasselblad images. It may be 0.7 fiducials left and 1.3 up from center.  David Harland has assembled the portion of the pan showing <a href="a16.spook_pan.jpg" title="image" target="new">Spook Crater</a> with Stone Mountain and the South Ray ejecta blanket in the background.  Spook has a diameter of 370 meters.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:23:38</b> Young: Somebody (meaning <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a>) is working the TV, and it ain't even locked up yet!

<blockquote><i>[That is, John hasn't yet pointed the high-gain antenna at Earth.  On 15, during a straight drive along smooth ground west of Station 9, Scott and Irwin left the TV on in an effort to give the folks back home a view from the Rover in motion.  That experiment did not succeed.]<p>

[Fendell starts a clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:23:42</b> England: (Passing on an urgent message from Experiments via the Flight Director)  Okay, John.  We'll need to press on with that 
<a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">LPM</a>, or we won't get it done.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:23:57</b> Duke: (To John) How's your pointing from that...?  (Pause) Okay; since you don't...(Since you) just do LPM, John and I'm gonna do the 500, I won't put your bag back on.  Okay?<p>

<b>124:24:11</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1242412">124:24:12</a></b> Duke: And take that time.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes past the TV, probably headed for the CDR seat.  John dusts the TV lens.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:24:14</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  Under here, again, right under the
regolith, the first centimeter or so, we have the white albedo material.<p>

<b>124:24:23</b> England: Understand.  (To John)  Hey, that does a good job on the lens there.<p>

<b>124:24:28</b> Young: Your eye looks clear to me here, Houston.<p>

<b>124:24:30</b> England: Yeah, that helped a lot.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John now uses the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">big dustbrush</a> on the LCRU mirrors.  We get a good view of the top of his camera - including the &quot;CDR&quot; label.  John moves out of the way as he continues his dusting and we get a view toward the southeast into Spook.  Stone Mountain is in the background.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:24:38</b> Young: And the Earth is...You should be locked up, I
guess.  And the Earth is boresighted in the boresight machine.  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1242453">124:24:53</a></b> Duke: Thirty.  Okay.  (Pause)  That's gonna be cross-Sun, so I'm going to do it at f/8.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[We have an unobstructed view toward South Ray Crater and the raised rim is visible even at the low resolution of the TV picture. 
The rim diameter is about 700m and South Ray is about 6.3 km SSW of Station 2.]<p>

[In a few moments, Charlie will start a series of 500-mm pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:25:07</b> England: That (meaning Spook)'s a deep monster, isn't
it?<p>

<b>124:25:08</b> Duke: How you read me, Houston?<p>

<b>124:25:09</b> England: We're copying you fine.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:25:17</b> Duke: Doesn't sound like they're reading us.<p>

<b>124:25:20</b> Young: (To Houston) (If you) read, wag your TV.  (Pause) (Garbled), Charlie.  (Will you) fix this thing for me?<p>

<b>124:25:35</b> Duke: Let me take these pictures. <p>

<b>124:25:38</b> Young: Look, Charlie?<p>

<b>124:25:39</b> Duke: Huh?<p>

<b>124:25:40</b> Young: I've got to do this LPM.<p>

<b>124:25:41</b> Duke: Okay.  You don't want to go ahead and get started with that?<p>

<b>124:25:42</b> Young: (A little sharply) I want us to do it, but I...<p>

<b>124:25:43</b> Duke: (Backing off) Okay, okay, okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:25:49</b> Duke: Houston, do you read?  Over?<p>

<b>124:25:50</b> England: We're copying 5 by.  How us?<p>

<b>124:25:56</b> Young: Did you knock your (<a href="../alsj-RCU.html" target="new">RCU</a>) Mode switch Off?  Or did I knock mine Off?<p>

<b>124:25:58</b> Duke: We're both in AR.<p>

<b>124:26:05</b> England: John and Charlie, this is Houston.  You copy?<p>

<b>124:26:10</b> Young: Yeah, loud and clear.  Where you been?<p>

<b>124:26:21</b> Duke: Okay, there it is.<p>

<b>124:26:26</b> Young: What am I hung up on now, Charlie?<p>

<b>124:26:28</b> Duke: Okay, you got on that what-cha-ma-call-it,
that...<p>

<b>124:26:31</b> Young: Hangs out there?<p>

<b>124:26:32</b> Duke: That hangs out there.  Yeah. <p>

<b>124:26:34</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and finds Charlie,
who is getting the Hasselblad with the 500-mm lens out from under John's
seat.  Charlie walks off-camera to the right and John comes into view,
going to the back of the Rover to deploy the LPM.]<p>

[Training photo <a href="ap16-KSC-72PC-143.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-72PC-143</a> shows Charlie practicing with the 500-mm lens at the Cape.  There is no viewfinder and the camera must be aimed by sighting along the top of the camera body and lens.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:26:49</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>124:27:10</b> Young: Ol' LPM.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is at the right rear of the Rover, behind the LMP
seat.  He looks at his checklist and, after examining 
<a href="a16.lsp069.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-34 and CDR-35</a>, turns the page to read 
<a href="a16.lsp071.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-39</a> which lists detailed LPM procedures.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:27:22</b> Duke: (Subvocal) Dadgummit.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]<p>

[John goes to his knees at the back of the Rover pulls some pins to release the LPM.  Once he has the sensor free, he stands up and pulls a supporting tripod out of a mount on the gate and then attaches the sensor to it.  In Apollo 14 photo 
<a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">S70-56721</a>, the sensor is the small, gray box mounted on the top of the tripod.  The box that houses the readout gauges, the on/off switch, and a gain switch is mounted on the back of the Rover.  Training photo 
<a href="ap16-KSC-71PC-776.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-71PC-776</a> shows John working at the back of the Rover, possibly stowing the LPM cable reel.  Note where the cable enters the readout box mounted on the top back corner of the Rover near John's right hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:28:40</b> Duke: Hey, Tony.  I'm going to take a few (pictures) of South Ray here, with the 500.  We got a good view of it here.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has finished his <a href="a16pan18193-232.jpg" title="image" target="new">500-mm pan of Stone Mountain</a>, which consists of frames AS16-112-
<a href="images16.html#18193" target="new">18193</a> to

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Let me talk about the 500-mm targets, John, just a little bit.  I took those of Stone and the only thing that was significant about Stone was these lineations that I described; and they trended southwest.  It looked as if they started at the east and gradually climbed upslope and over the ridges; and you could just follow them all around.  They did not follow any contour lines or any of the bench lines.  They seemed to transect all that stuff.  They were very closely spaced when I took the 500s.  But, later on, we looked back over there on each EVA and, as the Sun (elevation) changed, the spacing between those lineations changed.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Not only that.  When we got up on Stone Mountain, I didn't see any lineations.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;You couldn't see
it.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I don't know what that
means; but they sure weren't there.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;At Flag Crater, in the
undisturbed regolith, you could see lineations that were mostly (oriented)
northwest/southeast.  (See the dialog at 
<a href="a16.sta1.html#1235633" target="new">123:56:33</a>.) It looked as if the regolith was loosely compacted and the particles were standing up and the lineations were formed by the Sun shining on these particles - creating little, slight shadows.  I
think that's really what those little lineations are.  I took some pictures
of that, (AS16-109-
<a href="images16.html#17806" target="new">17806</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#17807" target="new">17807</a>).  I hope it'll show.  That was the feeling I got.  If you just kick dust over it, it'd mask it and be gone.  I think maybe those things up on the mountains were the same kind of feature, but on a more gross scale.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;On Hadley Rille (Meaning
Mt. Hadley at the Apollo 15 site), it might have been.&quot;]<p>

[See, also, the discussion at 
<a href="a16.sta1.html#1240231" target="new">124:02:31</a> and 
<a href="a16.sta1.html#1240336" target="new">124:03:36</a>.  Charlie's photo AS16-112-
<a href="images16.html#18217" target="new">18217</a> shows some of the lineations.]<p>

[Charlie's <a href="a16pan18233-9.jpg" title="image" target="new">500-mm pan of South Ray</a> consists of AS16-112-
<a href="images16.html#18233" target="new">18233</a> to 
<a href="images16.html#18239" target="new">18239</a>, of which 
<a href="images16.html#18236" target="new">18236</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18237" target="new">18237</a> are the least blurred.]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The 500 worked great.  It
was a little bit more difficult to stabilize it than I thought.  I used the
ring sight and fired off the pictures.  We could see into Stubby and we
could see into the southeast wall of Stubby.  You could not see the
apparent flow that is on the (pre-mission) photograph.  It was not apparent to me, looking at it, I thought.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:28:53</b> Young: Agh! (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The sensor falls off the tripod but John manages to catch the ribbon cable on his wrist and retrieves the sensor easily.  He finally gets it attached.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:29:08</b> Young: Okay, the LPM has got its sensor head on it, and the power switch is coming on Mark.<p>

<b>124:29:14</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[The power switch is on the <a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">LPM electronics box</a> which is mounted on the Rover behind the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:29:18</b> Young: And the temperature label says
&quot;Nothin'&quot;.<p>

<b>124:29:20</b> England: All right.<p>

<b>124:29:20</b> Young: All of 'em are black.

<blockquote><i>[A temperature label - or 'tempa-label' - is patch with a series of spots which change from white to black at successively higher temperatures.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:29:23</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, the 500 millimeter's up to 50.<p>

<b>124:29:26</b> England: Okay.  We copy that.

<blockquote><i>[John walks sideways as he moves away from the Rover.  The ribbon cable is wound on a double reel (lower right in the 
<a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">photo</a>) - with the sensor end of the cable emerging from one side and the Rover side emerging from the other.  After a few feet, John stops, puts the LPM down, and manipulates the cable, probably getting some twists out.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Let me say something about the LPM.  The thing that surprised me was that there were no problems reading it in the Sun.  We also anticipated that it would be hard to wind up (based on Ed Mitchell's Apollo 14 experience with the instrument); but it was easy to wind up.  The problem was to unstow it.  After each deployment, it got harder and harder to pull loose and I thought on the last one that the cable might bust before we got it completely unwound.  Just shows, you never know what your problem is going to be up there.  It just got harder and harder to pull free.  But, it was easy to wind up and it's easy to set up and easy to operate and we'd probably have made a few
more readings if anybody had been interested.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:29:30</b> Duke: I guess I take a few too many.  I had a triple,
vertical, stereo pan on Stone Mountain, and about five frames on old South Ray.  Over.<p>

<b>124:29:46</b> England: Okay, we copy that.

<blockquote><i>[With the cable now straightened, John moves away from the Rover, going in a northwesterly direction.  Fendell follows and we see the reel bouncing wildly at the middle of the lengthening cable.  As he gets
near the end of the cable, he moves sideways toward the south.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>124:29:51</b> Duke: Okay, I'm finished with my pan, and the 500.  I'm
gonna run over to Buster and do some sampling.  Over.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:30:05</b> Young: Buster is really an impressive crater, Houston. 
The walls are so darn steep, and the blocks are <i>all</i> over it.<p>

<b>124:30:13</b> England: Okay, we copy that.  And Charlie, sounds like
you've got a good plan there.<p>

<b>124:30:19</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  And if you'll notice, I'm carrying
John's bag, and the shovel, and I'm not taking the gnomon.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie runs north toward Buster, starting with the
foot-to-foot, loping stride and then switching to his distinctive, sideways
hop.  He goes off-camera to the right.  John reaches the end of the LPM
cable and sets the tripod on the ground.  As can be seen in Figure 6-29 in
the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, John is about 20 meters WNW of the
Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:30:42</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>124:30:45</b> Duke: Man, that's gonna be a little steep ridge to climb
(up to the rim of Buster).  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John orients the LPM relative to the Sun and then presses the legs into the surface to level it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:31:07</b> Duke: You get -  (Pause)  Yeow whee!  Man, John, I tell
you, this is some sight up here, looking down into that beauty.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans right to find Charlie.  Buster has a diameter of 90 meters.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1243119">124:31:19</a></b> Duke: (Slightly winded from the climb) Tony, the blocks in Buster are covered...(Correcting himself) The bottom is covered with blocks - the largest 5 meters across.  The blocks seem to be (in) a preferred orientation, northeast to southwest.  They go all the way up the wall on those two sides;  and on the other sides, you can only barely see them outcropping in about 5 percent.  Ninety percent of the bottom is covered with blocks that are 50 centimeters and larger.  And I'll get a partial pan into there.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell zooms in on Charlie, who is standing on the south
rim of Buster, obviously above the level of the Rover.    John's SCB is
upright on the ground next to Charlie.  In the foreground, we can see the
inbound Rover tracks; and, in background, a portion of the north rim of
Buster.  We know this is the north rim of Buster - rather than the summit
of Smoky Mountain, in part because of the visible rocks scattered on it. 
The Rover tracks indicate that John and Charlie drove nearly to the rim
when they were trying to figure out which crater was Spook at about <a href="a16.trvsta2.html#1241923" target="new">124:19:23</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1243212">124:32:12</a></b> England: Good show.  It makes it sound like a secondary. <p>

<b>124:32:14</b> Duke: And...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>124:32:18</b> Young: I know, boy.

<b>124:32:20</b> Young: Okay, Houston, I'm back (at the Rover).  The sensor number 1 is on there and...<p>

<b>124:32:26</b> Young: Mark.<p>

<b>124:32:27</b> England: Okay; we started the clock.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:32:33</b> Duke: Tony, if that is a secondary, that is a <i>big</i>
rock that hit in there.<p>

<b>124:32:37</b> England: Rog.

<blockquote><i>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Buster was really an impressive crater.  We had some 3- to 5-meter blocks that covered 70 or 80 percent of the bottom of that crater.  And they trended up to the northeast slope and out the southeast slope of the crater.  There were large, meter-size blocks on the northeast rim.  Around on our side, the southeast side, we didn't have anything greater than half a meter.  I'm not sure Buster was a secondary crater.  If it was a secondary crater, it was really a big (piece of ejecta that hit), 'cause it was a big crater.  It was a primary crater and it had excavated into bedrock down there.&quot;]<p>

[The following is taken from the Apollo 16 <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>. 
&quot;Buster Crater appears to be too young to be a secondary from any
primary crater in the region, with the possible exception of South Ray
Crater.  Its relatively large size, compared to South Ray secondaries, and
its long distance from South Ray Crater make a secondary origin for Buster Crater unlikely.  It is therefore interpreted to be a primary
crater.&quot;]<p>

[Extensive studies of terrestrial and lunar impact craters - supported by
the results of numerical simulations - indicate that the largest pieces of
ejecta are derived from deep in the crater - where shock pressures are
relatively low - and don't travel far beyond the crater rim.  Pieces flung
out at high enough velocity to travel many crater diameters away are
generally subject to high pressures and, consequently, tend to be smaller. 
Although the EVA-1 sampling area is liberally sprinkled with ejecta from
both South Ray and North Ray, none of the pieces are anywhere near big
enough to have dug a 90-m crater like Buster.  If Buster is a secondary,
the projectile that dug it would have to have come from a far larger crater outside the local area.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:32:38</b> Duke: The rocks down there are very fractured, though.  The rocks down there are extremely fractured.  You can see a major fracture set running...(correcting himself) dipping about north 30 degrees on one rock.  The other one is subhorizontal, so it's just a very impressive sight as far as the boulder goes.  They're all angular.  Some of them...Well, I call some of them subrounded, but the majority of them are angular.  And they have a grayish texture to them and that's about all I can tell.  I got a partial pan from up here on the rim.  And I'm gonna start sampling.<p>

<b>124:33:21</b> England: Okay;  that sounds good, Charlie.  And why don't you press on sampling now?

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I think Charlie got some
rocks from Buster Crater that came from the bottom.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The rocks were very similar to the ones that we saw at North Ray (during EVA-3).  We sampled rocks out of South Ray Crater up on Stone Mountain (during EVA-2), but the rocks down there (at Stone) looked very similar to the rocks up at North Ray and the rocks at Buster.  So, there could be some underlying formation that goes across the whole Cayley Plain.  That might prove to be totally wrong, but at least from a color inference, these black and whitish rocks were everywhere.  They were everywhere, I think.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;The rock types you could classify as angular to subangular and with very little filleting around them.  There were some rocks from North Ray that had fillets developed, and I think that might be a way to tell one
from another (that is, South Ray ejecta from North Ray ejecta).&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The rock from North Ray was a little more rounded and not as sharp (as one might expect if the North Ray impact pre-dated the South Ray impact).  We had rocks from North Ray and South Ray in the landing site (and you can probably tell them apart) only by the angularity and the (fact that the) old rocks have more zap craters and are rounded off.&quot;]<p>

[Mattingly, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;You are saying that
those are North Ray rocks which had fillets?  That's a
hypothesis.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Yes.  That's a guess.  But I would say that is the best way to tell them apart.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I bet you five bucks that's
right.&quot;]<p>

[Mattingly, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I thought maybe you had traced them on the way up there (to North Ray).&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Of course, some of them
could have been from Buster, too.&quot;]<p>

[As indicated in USGS Professional Paper 1048, &quot;Geology of the Apollo 16 Area, Central Lunar Highlands&quot;, South Ray Crater is believed to be 1 to 4 million years old while North Ray is 30 to 50
million.]</i></blockquote>

takes only about 19 seconds.  On this trip, his average speed is about 2.7
km/hr, which is the average speed assumed for walkbacks of more than one hour.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:42:05</b> Duke: And if I don't get it in the bag, I don't think it's
going to survive.  Well, there's part of it in the bag, anyway.<p>

<b>124:42:10</b> England: That'll do fine.<p>

<b>124:42:12</b> Duke: It just broke in two in my hand.

<blockquote><i>[John gathers the tripod legs in his left hand and runs back to the Rover, letting the cable train along behind.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:42:15</b> England: Geochemists are always telling us how little rock they need.

<blockquote><i>[John bounds very high as he runs back and, at one point,
begins to get off balance.  In mid-air, he sticks his right hand out to the
side to stop the rotation.  He then does the rest of the short trip to the
Rover at a more sedate pace.  Although it is difficult to estimate how high
he gets, it appears that his RCU rises about a half meter on the highest
bounds.  During his longest stride, he is airborne for about 1.25 seconds. 
This figure suggests a maximum height of 0.32 meters and, if his forward
speed was 5.5 km/hr or 1.5 m/s, a stride length of 1.9
meters.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:42:22</b> Duke: Okay.  And that's in bag number 9.<p>

<b>124:42:26</b> England: Okay; bag 9.<p>

<b>124:42:29</b> Young: They're going to get a lot of nice rock samples
today.<p>

<b>124:42:34</b> England: Good show.  It sure sounds that way. <p>

<b>124:42:35</b> Young: (Lost under Tony) nice little rocks.<p>

<b>124:42:39</b> England: Sounds like a lot of rocks.<p>

<b>124:42:41</b> Duke: That was a real balancing act, Tony.<p>

<b>124:42:43</b> Young: And if somebody cleans our suits, they can get
another 5 pounds.<p>

<b>124:42:49</b> England: That's our comprehensive sample.

<blockquote><i>[John goes to get the cable reel.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:42:51</b> Young: Now, here comes the interesting part.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Without support, John drops to his knees, grabs the cable reel, and then jumps up.  When he retrieved Charlie's bag dispenser, he made a dynamic grab and wasn't motionless for more than a fraction of a second at the bottom.  Here, he stays down long enough that we can see the effort he has to make to keep from being pitched forward by the
suit.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:43:05</b> Duke: Very good, John.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[There is a <a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">crank</a> on one side of the reel and John begins to wind up the LPM cable with his right hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:43:14</b> Young: Ed (Mitchell) was right, it does wind up on itself.

<blockquote><i>[Mitchell operated the LPM during Apollo 14, the only other mission on which it was deployed.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:43:18</b> England: Yeah, Ed's sitting here chuckling.<p>

<b>124:43:20</b> Young: Will it unwind on itself?  (Hearing Tony and
laughing)  Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[As the cable lifts off the ground, it jumps and snakes
around.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:43:23</b> Duke: Look at that thing!  It's like a bowl of
spaghetti!<p>

<b>124:43:30</b> Young: What I hope is, it (meaning the loops) doesn't end up going into the mouth of the (reel)...(Pause)  (Chuckles)  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:43:46</b> England: Well, you're doing pretty good there, John. <p>

<b>124:43:51</b> Young: Oh, yeah.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Once the LPM cable is completely off the ground, John walks toward the back of the Rover, continuing to wind as he goes.  He winds for a total of about 53 seconds.]<p>

[In the background, Charlie is bagging a sample.  His &quot;befores&quot;
of this sample are AS16-109-
<a href="images16.html#17847" target="new">17847</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#17848" target="new">17848</a>.  Readers should note that, because he isn't using the gnomon, he isn't taking any down-Suns, which are designed, primarily, to get the sample and the color/gray scale in the same picture.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1244407">124:44:07</a></b> Duke: Okay;  bag number 10, Tony, is another one. <p>

<b>124:44:10</b> England: Okay, bag 10.<p>

<b>124:44:12</b> Duke: It's an angular rock.

<blockquote><i>[Standing next to the SCB, Charlie leans the scoop against his leg and spins the bag to close it.  This sample is 62295, a 0.25 kg igneous rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:44:19</b> England: Charlie, we better get you loaded back up.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell zooms in as Charlie drops bag 10 in the open SCB
and grabs his scoop.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:44:21</b> Young: I was worried about that power cab(le)...<p>

<b>124:44:24</b> England: Say again, John.<p>

<b>124:44:26</b> Young: I was worried about...On the geophone
experiment...(Hearing Tony)  Huh?

<blockquote><i>[John is probably talking about the LPM cable, rather than
the geophone cable.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:44:28</b> Duke: They want us to load up, John.  I guess
they're...I'm running out of water.<p>

<b>124:44:35</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets a sample bag and collects a quick, left-handed soil sample.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have the sample bag completely open and, during the following exchange between John and Tony, brings his hands together to try to get it open and, in the process, loses the entire sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:44:38</b> England: John, go ahead with what you were saying.<p>

<b>124:44:40</b> Young: I said...Have we got a problem of some kind?  Are we needing to get Charlie back?<p>

<b>124:44:49</b> England: It's no problem.  We're just trying to...You're a little bit late on this station and, to get everything in and so to get
back in on time, we might be a little late.<p>

<b>124:45:00</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>124:45:02</b> Duke: We understand.

<blockquote><i>[When John and Charlie first arrived at this station,
Houston told them that it was going to be a 19-minute stop.  They have
already been here about 24 minutes and, back in Houston, there has been an ongoing discussion about which tasks have to be completed back at the LM before the end of the EVA.]<p>

[Once Charlie gets the bag open, he gets another scoop of soil and bags it
easily.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was the scoop you had the sort that had the little squeeze
plates on the side and you could angle it?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Uh-huh&quot;]<p>

[Figures <a href="../tools/judy46.gif" title="image" target="new">46</a> and <a href="../tools/judy47.jpg" title="image" target="new">47</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Book show the Large,
Adjustable-Angle Scoop that was flown on Apollo 16 and 17.  A smaller
version was flown on Apollo 15.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It's interesting that Jack had a relatively easy time
getting rocks solo and a terrible time getting soil; and you had a
relatively easy time getting soil, most of the time.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It didn't seem like it was any problem.  If I was real slow
with it - you know, bringing it up...The problem is that you'd hit it, and
the rock would be in there and it'd be hung up a little bit - half buried -
and you'd break it loose and it would pop like that and up it would fly (as
happened at <a href="#1244000" target="new">124:40:00</a>).  And that was
really the problem.  But, with soil, you could just pick it up smooth, with
one smooth motion.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Looked to me like you might have the scoop head angled at
about the 45-degree position.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:45:03</b> England:  Right.  We are going to shorten the EVA by about 8 minutes, is all.<p>

<b>124:45:10</b> Young: (Incredulous and pleased) 8 minutes!<p>

<b>124:45:11</b> Duke: (Laughing)  We'll settle for that.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie leans the scoop against his leg but decides it
won't be stable and pushes it into the ground.  He then spins the bag once
and &quot;Z&quot;s the tabs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:45:18</b> Duke: We got four (rock) samples and about...That (soil) sample is going into bag 11, Tony.<p>

<b>124:45:25</b> England: Okay, bag 11.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie hops back and drops bag 11 in the
SCB]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:45:30</b> Duke: And here, Tony, I don't really see...(Picking up the SCB and feeling the weight) Man, that's a sackful, John!  (Pause)  (To
Tony) I don't see the high albedo stuff underneath.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie grabs the scoop and hops sideway, probably to avoid a small crater hidden by an intervening rise, and heads toward the Rover. 
Fendell follows and, as Charlie goes around to the CDR seat, we see John
working at the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:45:50 </b> Young: Well, that thing (meaning the LPM) is in as good as I can put it back in, Houston.  But I wouldn't be surprised to see it
hanging out some day.<p>

<b>124:46:02</b> Duke: Houston, I hate to tell you this, but those rocks,
these light ones here, (chuckling) they look like caliche to me.

<blockquote><i>[Caliche is a calcium carbonate deposit usually associated
with water deposition and, therefore, very unlikely in the dry lunar
environment.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:46:12</b> England: Well, who knows?

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans right to follow John as he goes to the front
of the Rover to turn the TV off.  Charlie is putting the full SCB under the
CDR seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:46:18</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  (Reading 
<a href="a16.lsp069.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-35</a>) We're going frame (means &quot;Mode&quot;) switch to 1 and (camera full)
CCW(counter-clockwise).  You already got it in CCW?  Yeah.  Mode switch is
going to 1, Houston.

<blockquote><i>[TV off.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:46:32</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)  And could I get your final frame count?<p>

<b>124:46:41</b> Young: You just got mine.  I gave you the last rate count on the...<p>

<b>124:46:46</b> England: Right.<p>

<b>124:46:47</b> Young: ...on the LPM (documentation photo).<p>

<b>124:46:49</b> Duke: Okay, I'm...(Static)<p>

<b>124:47:00</b> Duke: (Static clears) really works great.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>124:47:16</b> Duke: And the old pallet (the gate on the back of the Rover) is closed.  Locks right in there; look at that beauty.<p>

<b>124:47:24</b> Young: Okay, Charlie, check  <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">Minimum on the cooling</a>?<p>

<b>124:47:26</b> Duke: Oh, yeah.  Okay, I am.  (Pause as Charlie gets into his seat)  There we go.  I did it that time.<p>

<b>124:47:45</b> England: And John...<p>

<b>124:47:46</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>124:47:46</b> England: ...can you check and make sure your purge valve pin's still in?<p>

<b>124:47:51</b> Young: Is it in, Charlie?<p>

<b>124:47:57</b> Duke: Ain't no way I could tell, unless you...Yeah, it's there.  Uh-huh, I saw it.<p>

<b>124:48:01</b> England: Outstanding.<p>

<b>124:48:03</b> Duke: Whew!  (Pause)  (Playing verbally) We are mounting upon the vehicle!  As they say, Houston.<p>

<b>124:48:14</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>124:48:15</b> England: That skill is awesome.<p>

<b>124:48:15</b> Young: (Lost under Tony) Charlie.<p>

<b>124:48:16</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>
