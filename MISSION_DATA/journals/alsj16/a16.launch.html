<b>173:08:30</b> Irwin: Okay, Orion; this is Houston.<p>

<b>173:08:36</b> Duke: Go ahead, Jim.<p>

<b>173:08:37</b> Irwin: Roger.  For your reference, if you can just add 4 hours to all the times listed in your checklist there, you will be very close - within 1 minute - for your timing purposes.<p>

<b>173:08:52</b> Young: (Chuckles)  Okay.  Just as soon as we get a clock running, we'll be more than happy to do that.<p>

<b>173:08:59</b> Irwin: Okay.  The only thing we're anxious to have you do now is the LGC/IMU power-up.<p>

<b>173:09:07</b> Young: That's in work.<p>

<b>173:09:08</b> Irwin: Roger.<p>

<b>173:09:13</b> Young: Okay.  You want your E(rasable)-memory dump?<p>

<b>173:09:16</b> Irwin: Stand by.  (Pause)  We don't have data yet;  so stand by.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>173:09:36</b> Young: Okay.  The computer test is successful.  And we're holding for your dump.<p>

<b>173:20:30</b> Young: Boy, that's nice.  That's the first time in 3 days we've known what time it is.  153:32:24, huh?

<blockquote><i>[For some reason, the on-board clock is 20 hours behind.]</i></blockquote>

<b>173:20:42</b> Irwin: Roger.  We're glad to see you guys get on time.  You've done pretty good without a clock.  (Pause)  Okay, Orion.  This is Houston.  I have the lift-off time for your P57.<p>

<b>173:21:23</b> Young: Okay.  Just a second, Jim.<p>

<b>173:21:25</b> Irwin: Okay.  (Pause)

<b>173:22:38</b> Young: Okay.  Is that a good T-ephem?<p>

<b>173:22:41</b> Irwin: Stand by.  (Pause)  Okay.  T-ephem looks good.<p>

<b>173:22:51</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Long Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>173:28:44</b> Irwin: Orion, this is Houston.  Casper (meaning Ken Mattingly in the Command Module)  is going to try a VHF check here shortly.<p>

<b>173:28:52</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  Okay, we're on VHF A to Receive.<p>

<b>173:29:02</b> Irwin: Roger.<p>

<b>173:30:47</b> Irwin: Okay, Orion.  Casper is reading you.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>173:31:04</b> Young: Okay, I'm not reading him.  (Pause)<p>

<b>173:31:12</b> Irwin: Orion, verify that your B Receiver's On.<p>

<b>173:31:26</b> Young: Okay, Casper.  How do you read?  Over.<p>

<b>173:31:35</b> Duke: Rog.  We read you 5 by, Ken.  With a little squeal.<p>

<b>173:31:46</b> Young: How's things up there?<p>

<b>173:31:52</b> Young: Good show.

<blockquote><i>[Long Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>173:36:54</b> Young: Houston, how do you like those torquing angles?<p>

<b>173:36:59</b> Irwin: Stand by.  (Long Pause)  Okay, we've copied the angles.  (Pause)<p>

<b>173:37:32</b> Young: Okay, they're parked at 153:49:15.<p>

<b>173:37:37</b> Irwin: Roger.  (Long Pause)  Orion, let's go low-bit-rate.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>173:39:48</b> Irwin: Orion, this is Houston.  Verify rendezvous radar breakers are closed.  For the antenna positioning.<p>

<b>173:39:59</b> Young: Yeah, it's in work.<p>

<b>173:40:00</b> Irwin: Roger.  (Long Pause)  Orion, this is Houston, with a change for your Surface Checklist.<p>

<b>173:40:49</b> Young: Okay.  Go ahead, Houston.<p>

<b>173:40:51</b> Irwin: Okay, it's on page 8-16.  We want you to close System A Main SOV prior to System A Ascent Feed, 2, open.  Over.  (Pause)<p>

<b>173:41:18</b> Young: Okay, understand.  Say again what page it's on.<p>

<b>173:41:25</b> Irwin: That's 8-16.  Just before you open the Ascent Feeds, we want you to close System A Main SOV (Shut-Off Valve).  (Pause)<p>

<b>173:41:50</b> Young: Okay, close System A Shut-Off Valve, just before opening the Ascent Feeds.<p>

<b>173:41:57</b> Irwin: Roger.  (Pause)<p>

<b>173:42:08</b> Duke: Jim, can you give us some words about Main...(Correcting) System A?<p>

<b>173:42:13</b> Irwin: Stand by, Charlie.  We'll get a story for you.

<blockquote><i>[This is a change from normal procedures and, of course,  John and Charlie want to know the reason for the change.  Jim gives them an explanation at <a href="#1740321" target="new">174:03:21</a>.]</i></blockquote>


<b>173:42:16</b> Irwin: In the meantime, perhaps while you're grabbing a bite to eat, I've got a lot of time line book changes, if you'd like to eat while I read them up to you.<p>

<b>173:42:31</b> Duke: Could you stand by a minute?  We've got a couple of more stowage items to do.<p>

<b>173:42:36</b> Irwin: Okay, just let me know when you're ready.

<b>173:55:15</b> Duke: Okay, Jim, I'm ready for the ascent pads.  Over.<p>

<b>173:55:19</b> Irwin: Okay, Charlie, I'll give you the direct pad first and I'm reading:  175:43:35.18.  I'll verify that one.

Over.<p>

<b>173:57:36</b> Irwin: Okay, the seconds on Tig is 35.18 and DEDA 53 is minus 76550.  Over.<p>

<b>173:57:50</b> Duke: Yeah, I got that, minus 76550 and Tig is 43:35.18.<p>

<b>173:57:57</b> Irwin: Good readback.  And now I'm ready for the coelliptic (Pad).  (Pause)<p>

<b>173:58:05</b> Duke: Go ahead.<p>

<b>173:58:06</b> Irwin: Will you give us high-bit-rate first, Charlie?<p>

<b>173:58:12</b> Duke: You got it.<p>

<b>174:00:27</b> Irwin: Okay, Noun 11 seconds is 33.91.  Over.<p>

<b>174:00:35</b> Duke: Rog.  And start with Delta-VY and read the rest of the pad.<p>

<b>174:01:33</b> Duke: Okay, we're ready for the time line update.<p>

<b>174:01:36</b> Irwin: Okay, I'll read it.  Most all of these items occur after docking, so if we run into any time problem, why, we'll just break it off and pick it up when y'all come around the corner (meaning after Acquisition-of-Signal on the LM's first orbit.)<p>

<b>174:01:52</b> Duke: Okay.  Jim, we got all our stuff stowed.  We're sitting here getting a bite to eat.  And as we can gather, we're at lift-off minus 1:15 in the checklist.<p>

<b>174:02:03</b> Irwin: Okay.  We're showing about 1:29 here, so you've got about 15 minutes if you want to spend that time copying these changes.<p>

<b>174:02:14</b> Duke: I'd rather spend it eating.  I haven't even started yet.  If you can hold off on that.<p>

<b>174:02:18</b> Irwin: Okay, why don't y'all get something to eat.  And, Charlie, we can read these things to you real-time after docking.<p>

<b>174:02:31</b> Duke: That sounds best.  Thank you.<p>

<b>174:02:39</b> Young: Yeah, Jim, it doesn't look like... You can't quite do all of that stowage as fast as we planned it.  (Pause)  You probably know what I mean.<p>

<b>174:03:01</b> Duke: We look pretty presentable now though, Jim.  An hour ago, I wouldn't have given two shakes though.<p>

<b>174:03:10</b> Irwin: In other words, you're on time now, and you're all stowed.<p>

<b>174:03:16</b> Duke: Yeah, we're all stowed.  We're grabbing a quick bite.<p>

<b><a name="1740321">174:03:21</a></b> Irwin: Okay, that's good.  (Long Pause)  Okay, Orion, this is Houston with some words on your RCS.  At the present source pressure of 1200 psi, you've got 44 percent, system A.  If you should lose that pressure - in other words, a blowdown mode - you'll have 38 percent.  Over.<p>

<b>174:04:17</b> Duke: Right, sounds great.  Thank you.

<b>174:12:37</b> Irwin: Orion, this is Houston.  I have a basic plan here for post-docking that y'all can listen to while you're eating.<p>

<b>174:12:49</b> Young: Okay, Jim.  Go ahead.<p>

<b>174:12:51</b> Irwin: Okay, number 1 is you'll doff suits in the LM.  Item 2 is postpone some of the LM transfer until post-sleep.  Of course, the changes that I'll read up to you will take care of some of that.  Then item 3 is we'll power down the LM and dry out the water boiler.  Item 4:  be ready to close out the LM at 179:20; that's (second orbit) AOS plus 10 minutes, the next pass after docking.  Then item 5:  you'll re-enter the LM tomorrow and transfer completion and LM jettison.  Item 6:  you will need the LM Timeline Book and LM Contingency Checklist at docking to accomplish deactivation.  Over.<p>

<b>174:13:56</b> Young: Okay, understand.

<blockquote><i>[To summarize, they will launch at about 175:43 and rendezvous with the Command Module during the first backside pass.  AOS on the first orbit will occur at about 177:15 and, shortly after that, Jim will read up the time-line changes.  Then, after docking and doffing the suits, they will begin to closeout the LM for the sleep period after the second-orbit AOS, which comes at about 179:10.]</i></blockquote>

<b>174:13:58</b> Irwin: Okay, and at AOS there (on the first orbit), we have about 25 minutes to read you the changes if we don't get them to you while you're on the surface.<p>

<b>174:14:14</b> Duke: Okay.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>174:14:44</b> Duke: Okay, Jim, we're starting in on the launch prep (on Surface Checklist page <a href="a16surf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new">8-1</a>).<p>

<b>174:14:48</b> Irwin: Roger.  Understand launch prep.

<blockquote><i>[Journal Contributor David Woods suggests that the most likely source of light shining in John's eyes would have been reflections off the instrument panel that were directly lit by the Sun through the overhead, rendezvous/docking window.  At the time of liftoff (0127 GMT 24 April 1972), the Sun in 50 degrees above the eastern horizon on an azimuth of 077 (13 degrees north of East).  Based on a <a href="a16comp18299-309.jpg" title="image comparison" target="new">comparison of post-landing, down-Sun photos</a> that John and Charlie took out the windows about 2 hours after landing, the LM is facing an azimuth of about 264 (6 degrees south of west) and the azimuth in the opposite direction is 084.  Consequently, at lifoff the Sun's azimuth (079) is about 5 degrees north of being directly behind the LM.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[After the LM becomes too faint to be seen in the Rover camera, Fendell pans down until the camera is once again looking at the horizon at about 175:33:48.]<p>

[Journal Contributor Henning Conrad has noticed that, in a comparison between pre- and post-liftoff TV images of the LM ( <a href="a16_ascent-animation2.gif" title="two-frame animation" target="new">0.3 Mb, animated gif</a> ), it is quite evident that the footpads were pressed farther into the surface by the significant downward impulse that came with liftoff. On the left-hand side, the minus-Y (south) footpad has been slightly depressed and the footpad seems to have been displaced outward. There appear to be changes in the minus-Y secondary struts consistent with that outward displacement. Also, the minus-Y probe moves a small amount between frames. On the right-hand side, the plus-Y (north) footpad is clearly displaced downward by roughly one third of the footpad height. The footpad width is 94 cm. The height as measured in AS12-46-6779 is about 12 cm. Consequently, the downward displacement is about 4 cm. I don't see any indication of outward motion of the footpad or flexing of the secondary strut. However, the plus-Y probe does move much more than the minu-s-Y probe.  Note: The 'before' image was captured sometime before <a href="#1745407" target="new">174:54:13</a>, when Ed Fendell raised the TV camera slightly in preparation for tracking the ascent.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;But they did bring you home a day early.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, that's because they got nervous, I think, because, if the engine didn't work and we had a problem it gave them another, extra day, of consumables and stuff to try to figure out what was what.  The more you waited up there - if you did have a problem - the less time you had to think of something brilliant to fix it.  They got a little nervous and brought us home a day early, I think, just to make sure we could have some ample time to fix any problems.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
