<b>116:52:05</b> Young: (Unaware that he has a hot mike) Okay.  (EVA-1) cuff checklist.  Where's that at?

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break, which includes several more brief pieces of conversation, most of them unintelligible out of context.  The <a href="../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new">drink bags</a> are mentioned at one point, as per the bottom of the left-hand column on 3-8.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;We were in there talking to ourselves.  We were getting suited up at this point, and a lot of it was just talking to ourselves.  You know, 'where are we going to put this?' and those kind of things.  We had things all over and we had to keep things together and try to get 'em stowed in the right place so we could track 'em down when we got ready to use 'em.  So (during) a lot of this, we were not hot miked.  We did a lot of talking between ourselves as we were suiting up that wasn't on the air until we went hot mike.&quot;]<p>

[Readers should note that, for some reason, John forgets to install his <a href="../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new">drink bag</a>.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;On the first one, I forgot to put the drink bag in until after I got my suit on.  And you cannot put the drink bag in with the suit on.  Charlie put it in (at some point after <a href="#1173604" target="new">117:36:04</a>), and I helped him stuff it down; and it wasn't good enough.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Well, it went in; but you couldn't drink out of it.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I turned my head while we were outside, pulled the valve over, got it down in here somewhere and never could get the valve.  I had it down in my neckring somewhere.  I mean, I tried.  I was down in the suit (that is, bending his neck as much as possible to get his mouth partway into the neckring) scrounging around for it, but I could never get there.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>116:54:26</b> Young: (To Houston) You should see me hold up this 50-pound pressure suit with one hand while Charlie is unzipping it with one hand.  That's really neat.<p>

<b>116:54:38</b> England: Right.  You should bring some of that one-sixth g back here.  (Pause)<p>

<b>116:54:51</b> Young: Yeah.  You Earth people don't know how nice this is.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1165527">116:55:27</a></b> Young: (Unintentional key)  You got it.  (Pause)  Where're we going to stow them?  (Pause) (Garbled) get 'em loose.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break that includes unintelligible comm.]<p>

[They are now at the top of the right-hand column on 3-8.  John's &quot;where're we going to stow them&quot; may be a reference to the LCG plug and the PGA (Pressure Garment Assembly) Electrical Connector Cap which he will stow in a Beta-cloth bag, called the &quot;<a href="../a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="new">purse</a>&quot; which is hanging below Panel 5, directly in front of John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>116:58:29</b> England: Charlie, Houston.<p>

<b>116:58:36</b> Young: Charlie is putting on his suit.  I'll talk to you.<p>

<b>116:58:38</b> England: Okay.  If it's not too late on Charlie's helmet there, the suit people just want to make sure that he washes it out with water to get that orange juice out before he puts that anti-fogging stuff in there (as per checklist page 2-5).<p>

<b>116:58:55</b> Young: It's never too late to do something like that.  We'll do it.<p>

<b>116:58:58</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>116:59:02</b> Young: (Unintentional key)  We could've done it last night, you assholes!  (To Charlie)  They want you to wash it off with water before you put the anti-fog in there.  Did you wash it?<p>

<b>116:59:10</b> Duke: Huh?  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John's unintentional transmission was originally transcribed as &quot;You could've done it last night, you asshole&quot; and, indeed, that is what it sounded like to me until I listened very carefully to the tape while preparing this commentary.  Thanks, in part, to the original transcription, at the time of my mission review with Charlie, I was under the impression that John was cursing at him and, consequently, I approached the subject with more circumspection than was necessary in light of what I now believe is the correct transcription.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;One of the things that Jack commented on - Jack and Gene both - is that, in normal conversation between them, things tended to be fairly earthy; but, when the mikes were on, almost subconsciously, the word choices...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You clean it up.  We had the same problem.  Lot of times...Well, not a lot of times but this happened to us two or three times - at least three I can remember, and one especially in lunar orbit while we were waiting to go down, we had this orange juice problem and John started getting a lot of gas and, you know, it was really stinking up the whole place.  He was farting like crazy and he starts bitching about this orange juice and I think it was printed, verbatim, in Aviation Week!  And we were just laughing and giggling about it all, and all of that was going down to Houston.  So this is just another situation where that happened.  You know, you think you're talking to yourself and you just get, like you say, a little earthy.  But we tried not to do that when we were hot-miked but it slipped up on us a couple of times.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Somebody reading this, who didn't know all of you, might think that John's 'you asshole' would be a pretty...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;He wasn't talking to me.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;He was talking to himself?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, what he was really talking about was, you know, the people could have told us to do that last night, you see?  So he was really referring to the ground when he said that.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>116:59:27</b> England: (Letting John know that he has a hot mike) Roger, John.  We copy that.<p>

<b>116:59:36</b> Young: What did I say?  (Pause)<p>

<b>116:59:47</b> England: Roger.  We're just noting your hot mike.<p>

<b>116:59:57</b> Duke: Are we on mike?<p>

<b>117:00:01</b> England: Yes, you sure are. (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Despite Tony's veiled suggestion that they turn off the Vox, they do not do so immediately.  We hear them talking, but the microphone does not pick up enough for the conversation to be
intelligible.]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:00:52</b> Young: (Garbled) push to (garbled) lock mechanism's sure sticky. (Pause)<p>

<b>117:01:08</b> Duke: (Garbled).  Won't move. (Long Pause)<p>

<b>117:01:26</b> Young: (To Houston) Do you all want to be in Down Voice, or do you want to go Normal voice?<p>

<b>117:01:32</b> England: Stand by one.

<blockquote><i>[Long Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:05:09</b> Young: Charlie's <a href="../ApolloPRD.jpg" title="image" target="new">PRD</a> (Personal Radiation Dosimeter) reads 21111; (that is), 2 and four l's.<p>

<b>117:05:20</b> England: Okay; 2 and four l's.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:07:08</b> England: Orion, Houston.<p>

<b>117:07:16</b> Duke: Go ahead.<p>

<b>117:07:19</b> England: Verify Aft omni.<p>

<b>117:07:24</b> Young: Aft omni, Charlie.<p>

<b>117:07:28</b> Duke: We're on Aft omni.<p>

<b>117:07:30</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Long Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:12:39</b> Duke: ... Break it, because there's no way for a human being to get the crinkle out of there because he ain't got three hands.  Four hands would do a good job.  Two to hold - one to pull on the zipper and two to hold the crinkle ...

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;We'd had a problem, going out (to the Moon), with my zipper.  I couldn't get it zipped.  We attributed that to the fact that I'd stretched out a little bit in zero gravity.  And I'd had the suit fitted so tight that I just couldn't get the zipper closed.  You know, it's like stuffing a zippered suitcase so full you can't get it (closed).  Same deal.  And also, at this point, there was a crinkle back in the back of it - across the back - so that the zipper, instead of laying straight like that, it was like this?&quot;]<p>

[Like many Southerners, Charlie tends to turn statements - like the last sentence of the previous paragraph -  into a question, basically asking if I was understanding him.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Bent a little bit, like a finger crooked.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  And you couldn't get it around there.  So you had to hold it closed, then you needed another hand to pull the zipper, then you needed another hand to straighten the crook.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So, did the two of you...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, we did.  I've forgotten how we did that, but John finally got it done.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:13:04</b> England: Orion, Houston.<p>

<b>117:13:09</b> Duke: Go ahead.<p>

<b>117:13:10</b> England: At your convenience, we'd like you to switch (ECS) LiOH canisters and jettison the used one.<p>

<b>117:13:22</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Had they landed on time and done the first EVA before having a rest period, they would have waited until EVA-2 wake-up to replace the ECS primary cartridge with a fresh one stowed behind the ascent engine cover. (See a <a href="../a16/LM11-co3lbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> from an Apollo 16 LM-close-out picture. Because of the landing delay and the decision to postpone EVA-1 till after the first rest period, it is now time to make the rpelacement.  They will bring up another primary canister before the end of the EVA and will make another change after EVA-2 wake-up.]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:13:24</b> Young: You want to switch the LiOH canisters and jettison the used ones.<p>

<b>117:13:28</b> England: And we have some changes to your Surface Checklist and your EVA Cue Cards.<p>

<b>117:13:38</b> Duke: No, but they go in.<p>

<b>117:13:41</b> Young: Report, Charlie...<p>

<b>117:13:44</b> Young: Go ahead.<p>

<b>117:13:47</b> England: And leave the brackets for the LiOH canister.<p>

<b>117:13:52</b> Young: Understand, leave the brackets for the LiOH canister.<p>

<b>117:13:55</b> England: That's affirmative.<p>

<b>117:14:00</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>117:14:06</b> Duke: Okay, go ahead with the changes.<p>

<b>117:14:11</b> England: Okay, on your EVA-1 Cue Card.<p>

<b>117:14:18</b> Duke: Go ahead.

<blockquote><i>[Rather than use the Lunar Surface Checklist in book form, they have mounted two large <a href="a16PrepPost.html" target="new">cue cards</A> on the instrument panel that has the steps listed on both sides.  By using the cards, they won't have to turn pages as often.  The second card includes post-EVA procedures.  They have a pair of cards for each of the EVAs and one for the contingency of a One-Man EVA in the case that one of the PLSSs is inoperable.]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:14:19</b> Young: Plug in your water, Charlie.<p>

<b>117:14:21</b> England: On the right...<p>

<b>117:14:22</b> Young: Now, don't give me that ...<p>

<b>117:14:24</b> England: Okay, on EVA-1 Prep (<a href="a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new">side 1</a>), right-hand column, third line.  It says &quot;Comm:  Modulate - FM.&quot;

<blockquote><i>[Each side of each card has three columns of procedures. <a href="a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" titlle="image" target="new">Card 1 Side 1</a> has Equipment Preparation in column 1 and the first part of EVA-1 Preps in the other two columns.  <a href="a16EVA1Card1Side2.jpg" titlle="image" target="new">Card 1 Side 2</a> continues with three more columns of EVA-1 Preps. <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" titlle="image" target="new">Card 2 Side 1</a> has two final columns of EVA-1 preps on the left and the first part of EVA-1 post in the column on the right. <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" titlle="image" target="new">Card 2 Side 2</a> completes the listing of post-eva procedures.]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:14:37</b> Duke: EVA-1 prep, right-hand column.  Okay.  &quot;Modulate - FM.&quot;<p>

<b>117:14:47</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>117:14:48</b> Duke: What did you want to change it to?<p>

<b>117:14:49</b> England: Right.  We want to delete the &quot;Modulate - FM&quot; and delete &quot;Power Amplifier - Primary.&quot;<p>

<b>117:14:59</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>117:15:00</b> England: Okay, about halfway down that column under comm, it says &quot;Telemetry Biomed, Off.&quot;<p>

<b>117:15:13</b> Duke: Yep.  Yep.<p>

<b>117:15:16</b> England: Okay, delete that &quot;Telemetry Biomed, Off,&quot; and two lines later, it says &quot;Recorder, On.&quot; Delete that line also.<p>

<b>117:15:24</b> Duke: Okay.  What else?<p>

<b>117:15:34</b> England: Okay, stand by a second.<p>

<b>117:15:44</b> Young: ... water.  Yeah.<p>

<b>117:16:04</b> Duke: Yeah, that's right.<p>

<b>117:16:06</b> Young: It's hard to beat.<p>

<b>117:16:07</b> Duke: ...?<p>

<b>117:16:11</b> Young: No, they want to do it now.  Okay, Houston, we're in secondary.  On that LiOH canister, Charlie's changing now.

<blockquote><i>[Before Charlie removes the used Primary cartridge, they <a href="a16ECS-LiOH-Canister-Select.jpg" title="image" target="new">switch the ECS canister selector</a> from Primary to Secondary, directing airflow into the smaller cartridge. Once the new Primary cartridge was been installed, they will switch back to Primary.]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:16:28</b> England: Oh, okay.<p>

<b>117:16:31</b> Young: You do that, Charlie.  It'd be so much easier.<p>

<b>117:16:34</b> Duke: What CDR comm have you got?<p>

<b>117:16:56</b> England: Okay, John, on the <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new">back side</a> of that <a href="a16EVA1PrepPostCard2.jpg" title="image" target="new">EVA-1 and the EVA Post (card)</a>.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Tony isn't being very clear, but he is referring to the <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new">back of the second card</a>, which contains both EVA-1 Prep and EVA-1 Post procedures on the <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new">front</a> and EVA-1 Post procedures on the <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new">back</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:17:04</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>117:17:06</b> England: Okay, it's on the bottom half of the <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new">card</a>, left-hand column, third line up.  It says &quot;Telemetry Biomed, Left.&quot;<p>

<b>117:17:17</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>117:17:18</b> England: Delete that line.<p>

<b>117:17:30</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>117:17:31</b> England: Okay, go to your (LM) Surface Checklist, <a href="a16surf3-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 3-4</a>.<p>

<b>117:17:39</b> Young: Okay, Surface Checklist, page 3-4.<p>

<b>117:17:51</b> Young: Go ahead.<p>

<b>117:17:54</b> England: Stand by 1.  Okay, left-hand column, near the bottom of the page, it says &quot;On Houston cue:  Telemetry PCM, Low.&quot; Delete that line.  And delete - and delete the next line, &quot;S-Band Voice - Down Voice Backup.&quot; Delete that also.

<blockquote><i>[John's next transmission suggests that, while John is marking the checklist changes, he is also watching and/or helping Charlie change the LiOH canister on the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:18:20</b> Young: (To Charlie)  I wasn't going to stick it in there until you got that thing and it's shut, Charlie.<p>

<b>117:18:25</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>117:18:26</b> England: Okay, John.  We've got very poor comm; we're going to drop the link for a minute here.  We'll be back in a minute.<p>

<b>117:18:34</b> Young: Okay, I missed all you said about that page 3-4. You read me?<p>

<b>117:18:43</b> England: Roger.  I do now.  I'll come back to you in a minute, and we'll do 3-4 again.<p>

<b>117:18:49</b> Young: Okay.  Philosophically speaking, I would like to get all these changes in before one or the other of us puts on a pressure suit because...because the...We're in an energy conservation mode of operation, and I'd like to keep it that way.<p>

<b>117:19:04</b> England: Right.  I sure do agree with you, John.

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;What he's really talking about is 'Get everything done, you guys, before we start suiting up.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>117:19:56</b> Young: Okay.  Okay, Houston, the LiOH canister is changed, and we're back on primary.<p>

<b>117:20:07</b> England: Okay, we copy.<p>

<b>117:20:19</b> Young: ... Charlie?  Okay, Charlie's got his suit on and he's all laced up, and he's got a shot of water.<p>

<b>117:20:33</b> England: Very good.<p>

<b>117:20:35</b> Young: Yeah, it was terrific; how I know it.  Want to go ahead with the checklist changes or you want me to don my suit?<p>

<b>117:20:46</b> England: I'm trying to get an answer here.<p>

<b>117:21:53</b> Duke: Got it in?  ... around here.<p>

<b>117:21:57</b> Young: Roger.<p>

<b>117:22:05</b> Duke: Yeah, ... over with my suit.<p>

<b>117:22:10</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>117:22:58</b> England: Okay, John, on the checklist.<p>

<b>117:23:06</b> Young: Go ahead.<p>

<b>117:23:08</b> England: Okay.  On <a href="a16surf3-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 3-4</a>, the bottom left-hand two lines.  &quot;Telemetry PCM, Low&quot; and &quot;S-Band Down Voice Backup.&quot;<p>

<b>117:23:20</b> Young: ...<p>

<b>117:23:22</b> England: Delete both lines.<p>

<b>117:23:24</b> Young: Surface Checklist, Charlie.<p>

<b>117:23:32</b> Duke: We copy.<p>

<b>117:23:33</b> England: Okay, on the right-hand column of 3-4, the third line from the bottom, it says &quot;<a href="../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Cabin Gas Return (Valve)</a>, Auto.&quot; Change that to &quot;Open.&quot;<p>

<b>117:24:00</b> England: Did you get that, Charlie?<p>

<b>117:24:04</b> Duke: I copy.<p>

<b>117:24:05</b> England: Okay, on <a href="a16surf3-6_7.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 3-6</a>, the fifth line from the bottom in the left-hand column.  It says &quot;Cabin Gas Return, Auto.&quot; Change that to &quot;Open&quot; also.<p>

<b>117:24:26</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.<p>

<b>117:24:29</b> England: Okay, we've got it for now.  Later on, we'll have to change the cue cards for EVA-2 and 3 and...But that's the extent of the checklist change.  We've got one note here for you.  We're going to have a change to the material - the gear - that you bring up during the transfer on the EVA-1, and I'll catch you before you go up and remind you about it.<p>

<b>117:24:54</b> Duke: Okay, thanks.  ... put a ... on it, and we'll ... later.<p>

<b>117:24:59</b> England: Okay, good show.

<b>117:35:26</b> Duke: ...  How do you read?  Over.<p>

<b>117:35:37</b> England: Orion, Houston.  Go ahead.<p>

<b>117:35:41</b> Duke: ...  Okay.  You guys reading us?<p>

<b>117:35:45</b> England: You're very weak, Charlie.<p>

<b>117:35:51</b> Duke: How's that?<p>

<b>117:35:58</b> England: You're still weak.  I think we can copy you, though.<p>

<b><a name="1173604">117:36:04</a></b> Duke: Okay, look.  We're going to probably have some trouble with the comm here, Hank.  Are you sure you want to stay in Down Voice Backup or - just exactly what?  We're ready to go into the ... on the Lunar Checklist - the Lunar Surface Checklist, and John's got his suit on.  And we're gonna put the PLSSs on (as per <a href="a16surf2-6_7.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 2-6</a> or, identically, the center column of <a href="a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new">Card 1 Side 1</a>).

<blockquote><i>[However, before they don the PLSSs, they have to do the steps on <a href="a16surf2-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 2-5</a> of the LM Lunar Surface Checklist.  On several of the missions, the astronauts called the CapCom &quot;Hank&quot;, it usually was in retaliation because the CapCom has just used the wrong name.  Here, however, it doesn't appear that Tony made a mistake.]<p>

[Journal Contributor David Harland notes that, had they landed on schedule, they wouldn't have needed to don the suits.  They started <a href="../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new">donning the suits</a> at about 
<a href="a16.eva1wake.html#1164216" target="new"> 116:42:16</a> and most of the hour's worth of effort since then can be thought of as a secondary cost of the landing delay.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1173635">117:36:35</a></b> England: Okay.  We think this is the system with the best signal margin; I guess we'll have to stay with it.<p>

<b>117:36:47</b> Duke: Okay, you'd better think about - on the <a href="../PLSSComm.pdf" target="new">PLSS comm</a> check.  We're thinking maybe we could sort of go with ... you guys when we get out on the surface.<p>

<b>117:36:59</b> England: Right.  How are you copying us, Charlie?<p>

<b>117:37:09</b> Duke: You're loud and clear, Tony.<p>

<b>117:37:10</b> England: Okay.<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I'd like to say 'attaboy' right now for John Covington coming up with those new procedures.  The Lunar Surface checklist, his part of it, was just outstanding.  It was reorganized in real time and we never had a feeling that we were pillar-to-post in that checklist.  We had to flip pages, but it was all flowing well and, once we got on it, it led us right back to where we were back in sync by the time we got the prep card that we used - the cue card (which is where they are now).  He had done a lot.  Those things were well organized and I thought those set of procedures for the preps and posts flowed as smooth as glass.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:05:11</b> Young: ... another shot of (cooling) water.

<blockquote><i>[While it is possible that they are taking drinks from the  <a href="../water_gun.jpg" title="image" target="new">water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde), during the Technical Debrief John indicated that they frequently ran water through the LCGs to keep themselves cool.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Let me say something about the <a href="../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new">donning and doffing</a>.  We used a different procedure than that in the timeline in regard to coolant.  We used only Lunar Module (water) for cooling during donning and doffing and we only used the LCG pump.  We got the other hoses out of the way and sort of semi-stowed.  We didn't say anything (to Houston) about changing those procedures in real time, but it kept us significantly more hydrated than we would have been had we been on air coolant.  What we would do is we plugged into the (LM) water and got it running through our suits, cooled the LCG down, and then climbed into the pressure suit, which took a big chunk of energy.  And then, immediately, plugged the water in (again) and pushed the (LCG) pump (circuit breaker) in and gave it a squirt of water.  At various intervals, when we started to feel like we were running out of cooling, we'd push the pump (breaker) in for maybe 30 seconds worth, give it a squirt of water, and not use air coolant all the time that we were donning and doffing.  I'm sure that's the best way to work that system, because it keeps you from sweating.  It keeps you from doing the kind of (air) cooling that must dehydrate you.&quot;]<p>

[Slayton, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;You didn't run the pump continuously, though.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;No.  I think I'm going to recommend that they change the procedures to do it this way.  I first noticed this when we were running (that is, &quot;conducting&quot;) long durations of suit runs (in training) and we only had air coolant.  You really feel bad after you finish a long duration of suit run with only air coolant.  If you run with water coolant, you feel okay.  Now, I don't know why that is, but it sure is a fact.  Because (after) 5 hours of running in the suit with just air coolant, you suffer the next day.  (After) five hours of water coolant down at the Cape training, you can go the next day and run another one.  You don't feel like (doing) it very much, but you can do it.  I think it may be a difference that, if you can keep your body from sweating, you sure should do it; and running that water coolant for donning and doffing was ideal; plus, it had the added advantage of getting those two, big, long, cumbersome (oxygen) hoses out of the way, which were right in the traffic area.  That (meaning having the oxygen hoses in the way) is really a son-of-a-gun when it comes to doing things like changing comm out in the Lunar Module.  And we made that change (in procedures) in real time because it was actually like we practiced in the (LM cabin) mock-up down at the Cape.  I sure think it paid off.  I think it's a better way to do it.  I just don't think long-duration air coolant in the pressure suit - which we were in a lot of the time - makes your body sweat and you have to replenish the water by drinking it.  You don't always have time to think about doing that.  It may be a significant factor in getting the crew back hydrated, as opposed to being dehydrated.&quot;]<p>

Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso.  In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. <a href="../A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif" title="image" target="new">Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.]</i></blockquote>

vertical.  With the valve in this position, they will get oxygen flow into
the helmet.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It had a vertical and a horizontal position.  You'd put
it vertical and all the flow would go to the helmet; and that's what you
wanted.  You could go to horizontal and part of the flow would go to the
torso and part to the helmet.  But it was always nice to have it in
vertical because it'd flow over and wash out the helmet; and it was a lot
cooler with all the oxygen going to the helmet rather than into the
torso.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Now, later on, would you have switched it over to
horizontal to clean out water vapor or sweat?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;We could have but I don't think we did.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;The oxygen's coming in through the connectors on the
chest, but then there would have been some tubing to send it up to
vents...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Right at the back of the helmet.  There was a big space
(about 4 inches left to right by a quarter inch deep) and it would flow
right up over the back of the head, around and down the front of the
helmet.&quot;]<p>

the suit somewhere in the torso.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;What we had planned to do, pre-flight, was to have the mission timer running and we had our timeline blocked out so that, for each sequence that took, say, 20 minutes, we'd know where we were in the timeline and we wouldn't have to keep bugging the ground.  They wouldn't have to keep bugging us, either, to speed up or slow down.  We didn't have to do anything over.&quot;]<p>

<blockquote><i>[Prior crews had used the dump valve in the forward hatch to do the depressurization.  In order to do that, the LMP had to back up as far as possible and bend down to get the valve, which was not an easy task in a pressurized suit.  Here, Charlie is turning so that he can get his left arm up to the dump valve in the overhead hatch.  The Apollo 16 and 17 crews used only the overhead valve.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;On 17 Gene and Jack had to jockey positions fairly carefully.  Gene was the one who went up for the <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a>, because he's taller.  And, to get his right arm up, he had to get around with his PLSS to the circuit breaker panel.  Do you remember anything about how you did it.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I reached that for John.  I'm left handed, and I remember it was right up in here somewhere.  I didn't have any problem.  I just reached up and got it.  I think I might have had to stand up on my tiptoes.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Facing more or less inboard, I would imagine.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Right (correct).  Uh-huh.  Well, sort of inboard, sort of 45 degrees (facing the left-front corner) so that you can get your arm up.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;There was a little locking pin on the valve.  Did you have to get that out.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That might have been it.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;'Cause I don't remember any discussion of getting that pin out first.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That's probably what I'm talking about (at 118:52:41).&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;We used the overhead valve and it was horrible to reach in training; but, in one-sixth gravity, it was nothing: just (reached) right up there and got it.  I really felt familiar with those procedures.  That 'square-filling' we did (in training) really paid off, I'll tell you.&quot;]<p>

[In order to maintain proficiency, pilots make flights on a routine basis in which they perform various procedures and maneuvers so that they don't get rusty.  A record is maintained of the procedures that they have practiced in a given week or month and, after each proficiency flight, the appropriate squares on the form are checked - the square is filled.]</i></blockquote>

In that position, the valve would only dump oxygen if the cabin pressure exceeded 5.4 psi.  They will put the valve in the Open position as soon as they finish the pressure integrity check so, in this circumstance, the difference between Auto and Close is of no consequence.]<p>

[Because of the lower cabin pressure, the relative pressure in the suit has increased and they will watch their cuff gauges to make sure that the suit pressure has risen as expected and is decaying due to breathe-down.

<b>118:54:00</b> Duke: Okay; &quot;tone on and H2O flag A&quot;.<p>

<b>118:54:01</b> Young: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Because the PLSS sublimator will only operate in a vacuum, they won't turn the sublimator feedwater on until the hatch is open.  The appearance of an &quot;A&quot; flag in the <a href="../alsj-RCU.html" target="new">RCU</a> water window confirms both that the feedwater is off and that the sensor is working.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:54:02</b> Duke: Okay;  that's what I've got.  (Pause)  Okay.  Pressure's at 1 (psi), Houston.<p>

<b>118:54:10</b> England: Say again, Charlie.<p>

<b>118:54:15</b> Duke: Cabin pressure is down to 1 (psi).<p>

<b>118:54:20</b> England: Roger.  We copy.  (Pause)<p>

<b>118:54:29</b> Young: Okay; now, two minutes after we started that, we're supposed to be able to open the <a href="../forward_hatch.jpg" title="Frank O'Brien CAM photo" target="new">forward hatch</a>.<p>

<b>118:54:36</b> Duke: Well, we're down to five tenths.  Four tenths.<p>

<b>118:54:46</b> Young: You gonna put that (<a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a>) back to Auto before we get out, Charlie?<p>

<b>118:54:49</b> Duke: What does it say?  No, we're not.<p>

<b>118:54:54</b> Young: Yeah.  Better remember to do that.<p>

<b>118:54:56</b> Duke: If that thing came closed and we had a leak, we'd be in trouble.<p>

<b>118:54:02</b> Young: True.  (Garbled) <p>

<b>118:55:03</b> England: No, you want to leave one in Open, there.<p>

<b>118:55:07</b> Duke: We got it.  The overhead's in Open.

<blockquote><i>[If the hatch swung shut, with both valves Closed or in Auto, and there was a leak of oxygen into the cabin, they wouldn't be able to open the hatch until they bled the cabin pressure by opening the forward valve with a control mounted on the outside.  Under normal circumstances, that wouldn't be a problem.  If they were in a hurry because of a suit leak, they would be in trouble.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:55:09</b> Duke: Okay, John.  It's two tenths; you ought to be able to open that beauty.  (Pause)  Here she comes.

<blockquote><i>[John has to back up as far as possible and bend down to get the handle on the hatch.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:55:25</b> Young: Ain't coming open, though.<p>

<b>118:55:27</b> Duke: You've got the handle down.<p>

<b>118:55:30</b> Young: (Straining) I know it.  (Pause)<p>

<b>118:55:34</b> Duke: There it is.<p>

<b>118:55:35</b> Young: Yeah, man.<p>

<b>118:55:36</b> Duke: Hatch is open, Houston.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  (Grabbing the hatch as it swings in front of his knees)  Okay, I got it.  Look at that air...Look at that stuff stream out of there.<p>

<b>118:55:46</b> Young: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Mattingly, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Did you have a lot of stuff come out of the hatch like we had (during equalization of the LM and CSM cabin pressures)?&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;No, we saw a few dust particles fly out, but that was all.  To do the actual depress, we used the overhead valve and just left it open.  I never noticed much floating (up) that way.  The LM was extremely clean.  You know how many screws and little washers and things we found floating in the Command Module.  I guess, maybe, we found five in the LM the whole time.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was extremely clean until after the first EVA and, from then on, it was really dirty.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;John opened it.  We just practiced that way.  He opened it and then I took over and pulled it over in front of my feet.  And when we opened it, you can see what I commented here.  Boy, I tell you the dust and debris and everything just streamed out the hatch.  I mean, even though it was down to what we thought was a vacuum, it wasn't.  The lunar module was still outgassing a lot.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:55:47</b> Duke: Okay.  Okay, &quot;Forward hatch open.  PLSS open&quot;...&quot;Partially opened forward hatch.&quot;  It is.<p>

<b>118:55:53</b> Young: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[They have started the tasks under Final Prep for Egress at the bottom of the middle column on <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new">Card 2 Side 1</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:55:54</b> Duke: &quot;Primary H2O open.&quot;<p>

<b>118:55:56</b> Young: Okay, turn on my water switch.<p>

<b>118:55:58</b> Duke: Okay.  Stand by.  (Pause)  Can you back up?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is trying to turn on John's feedwater.  The feedwater on/off valve is the rightmost of the three controls on the bottom of the PLSS and is the hardest to reach, especially with the suit at greater than the normal working pressure of 3.8 psi.  Each of the controls has a distinct shape so that they can be distinguished by
feel.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:56:06</b> Young: Yeah.  Can you get it?<p>

<b>118:56:10</b> Duke: No.  (Pause)  There it is.  Okay, it's off (means &quot;on&quot;).<p>

<b>118:56:19</b> Young: I believe I can get yours.<p>

<b>118:56:21</b> Duke: Okay, just a minute.<p>

<b>118:56:23</b> Young: I don't think you can even reach yours, Charlie.<p>

<b>118:56:24</b> Duke: Got it.<p>

<b>118:56:25</b> Young: Got the water?  (Pause)<p>

<b>118:56:29</b> Duke: Yeah.  I think so;  check it.<p>

<b>118:56:31</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>118:56:33</b> Duke: (Grunting)  Ahh!<p>

<b>118:56:35</b> Young: Turn around, Charlie.<p>

<b>118:56:36</b> Duke: Okay, wait a minute.<p>

<b>118:56:37</b> Young: What are you getting.<p>

<b>118:56:38</b> Duke: I'm just trying to turn around!  You're in front of me.  Okay, there we go.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;As everybody (on the other LM crews) has remarked, once you get the gear on, the only thing you can do is get out of the spacecraft, because you've run out of room to do anything else.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;We were sort of running into one another at this point.  You can tell we're getting a little frustrated.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It's a real broom closet in there, I gather.  And
that's mostly because of the constraints of the Saturn V, isn't
it?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember what was the design constraint on the Lunar Module.  I don't think it was the Saturn.  It was more just the weight of things.  Well, of course, it had to fit into the slot of the LM adapter (just below the Service Module near the top of the Apollo stack).  And then, of course, there was a weight limit on how much you could carry down.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And volume does cost you a little bit.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  So, it was okay.  We got used to it.  This first
time was the hard part and then, after that, it got better.&quot;]<p>

[Journal Contributor David Harland calls attention to a discussion of the dimensions of the Saturn V and, hence, of the CSM and LM, on page 166 of  Mike Gray's </i>Angle of Attack: Harrison Storms and the Race to the Moon<i>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Would it be fair to describe it as 'barely
adequate'?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I wouldn't want it any smaller.  Let me put it that way. Yeah.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;A little bit larger would have helped.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Or the PLSS controls in a different spot;  that would have helped.  It was hard to get back over here with your arm.  With a proper design on the...I think the design was good; I'm not saying it wasn't good, 'cause the thing worked </i>great<i> once you got it going. But it was just hard to reach those switches in a confined environment.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Could you get the switches while you were on the Rover?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was easier.  For some reason the (feed)water (control) - Min, Max, Medium - was okay; that was the only one we ever touched.  I went to Aux water once, I think, on the first EVA.  Yeah, I didn't seem to have any trouble once I got outside.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:56:56</b> Duke: I think it's on, John.  (Pause)<p>

<b>118:57:03</b> Young: ... Charlie's ... is on your mark.  Okay, it's on, Charlie.<p>

<b>118:57:13</b> Duke: If you'd turn sideways, John, I think...<p>

<b>118:57:16</b> Young: If I could turn sideways, I'd be half as big as I am.<p>

<b>118:57:19</b> Duke: Okay.  You'll have to turn sideways to get out.<p>

<b>118:57:20</b> Young: I know it.<p>

<b>118:57:21</b> Duke: Okay, let's rest until the feedwater pressure comes up.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The sublimator contains a porous metal plate on which a layer of feedwater ice forms.  Heat transferred from the closed-loop water supply that flows through the LCG causes the outer layer of ice to sublimate, carrying off heat.  It takes a few minutes for the ice layer to form.  A rise in feedwater pressure indicates that fact.  It is the total amount of available feedwater and the rate at which it is used that is the main determinant of the length of an EVA.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:57:33</b> England: No, we don't have any telemetry here.

<blockquote><i>[Because of the need to save power, the high-bit rate that Houston would need to get PLSS telemetry is not available.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;The way I understand it is that you're still at low bit rate, here, to conserve power.  They're not getting telemetry, and that's mostly because of transmitter power.  There's still telemetry coming out of the PLSS but the LM isn't able to send it.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Apparently so.  I don't remember.  'Cause, once we got on the surface, they had everything - once we got the LCRU up.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:57:39</b> Young: (Garbled)  (Responding to Tony)  Oh, yeah?  (Pause)<p>

<b>118:57:46</b> Young: Leave your protective visor down, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[This is the gold-coated outer visor that provides protection from solar ultraviolet.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:57:48</b> Duke: (To Houston)  How long is it supposed to take to get the feedwater...to start feeding the cooling?<p>

<b>118:57:59</b> Young: Four minutes.<p>

<b>118:58:00</b> England: About four minutes.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1185842">118:58:42</a></b> Young: Do you want me to throw out the <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a>, Charlie?<p>

<b>118:58:46</b> Duke: I'll give it to you.  Okay?<p>

<b>118:58:51</b> Young: Don't think we can get it past us.

<blockquote><i>[The <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jettison bag</a> may be on the engine cover at this point and, because John and Charlie fill virtually the whole forward part of the cabin now that their suits are inflated, it would be all but impossible to get the jett bag to the hatch.]<p>

[In the following, John refers to the &quot;second jettison&quot; but probably means this jettison following the first rest period.  Had they landed on schedule, they would have done a jettison at the start of EVA-1 and the one after the first rest period would have been the &quot;second jettison&quot;.  The Buddy SLSS - or BSLSS - is a set of hoses which would allow the crew to share cooling water in the event that one of them had a PLSS failure.  The BSLSS was taken to the Moon inside the cabin and the BSLSS bag was its stowage bag.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;For the second
jettison, we loaded up the Buddy SLSS bag.  In training, the Buddy SLSS bag had been adequate.  Unfortunately, nobody had counted on us landing, eating a night's food, getting up the next morning, eating a breakfast, and then trying to stow all those food wrappings in the Buddy SLSS bag.  We just barely jammed all that stuff in there.  It was really overly full.  To tie the bag up, we finally ended up wrapping tape around it.  It was really a marginal operation.  Plus, the other <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a> would give you something to stand on (to avoid dust on the floor).  I don't think the Buddy SLSS bag makes a very good jettison bag.  It just wasn't big enough for the volume we had to put in it on the second jettison.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:58:53</b> Duke: Okay.  Fine.  You can't get back in that (right-rear)  corner?  (Pause)  No, sideways, like I am.  You ain't going to be able to get out unless you can get around!  There you go.<p> 

<b>118:59:08</b> Young: Okay, but that's as far as I go.

<blockquote><i>[In order to get out, John has to be facing the right rear so that he can lower himself toward the floor and get his feet out through the hatch.  Once he gets to his knees, he will move to his left to get centered and then will back out slowly under the DSKY.]</i></blockquote>

<b>118:59:13</b> Duke: (Garbled), but that's what we're going to have to do.  Okay, you get out and I'll put in the...(Pause)  I've still got a flag A.  You do, too.  Okay, yours just cleared;  so did mine.  (Asking John to look)  Didn't mine clear?<p>

<b>118:59:33</b> Young: You don't have any flags, Charlie.<p>

<b>118:59:37</b> Duke: Okay, Houston, the H2O flags have just cleared.<p>

<b>118:59:42</b> England: Okay.  We copy that.  (Pause)<p>

<b>118:59:52</b> Young: (To Tony)  Okay, shall we go to Intermediate on the cooling and see if it's working.  (To himself)  It's working.  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:00:05</b> Duke: Houston.  Can we go to Intermediate on the cooling?<p>

<b>119:00:14</b> England: Rog.  That's okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:00:20</b> Duke: I feel mine working.<p>

<b>119:00:21</b> Young: I do, too.<p>

<b>119:00:22</b> Duke: Okay, Houston, are we ready to get out?  We're ready to get out.<p>

<b>119:00:28</b> Young: Yeah.  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:00:31</b> England: Okay.  Let's go.<p>

<b>119:00:34</b> Duke: Okay, why don't you go out, John?<p>
