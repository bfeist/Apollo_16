      <p class="ed">[We rejoin Apollo 16 halfway through Rev 13, awaiting AOS]</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 98 hours, 5 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16. Three minutes and 50 seconds to aquisition of signal; that is, [for] the two spacecraft to come around the Moon on the 13th lunar revolution. Some 29 minutes, 24 seconds until ignition for the landing phase. Ignition time for PDI or Powered Descent Initiation is 98:35:04. The descent engine will burn for approximately 12 minutes 53 seconds. According to the nominal plan, for a total velocity change from orbital velocity all the way down to zero on landing at the lunar surface of 6698 feet per second [2,041 metres per second]. The Lunar Module Orion will slim down at a rate that would make a calorie counter envious for at the start of PDI, the Orion will weigh some 18 tons. By landing, she'll only weigh 9 tons. All of this weight loss, of course, is propellant. During the descent, the Lunar Module Pilot will be calling out numbers that the computer display has displayed for him. He will call them out to the Commander and both men will be in what is call a vox motor voice actuated communications so that those on the ground can hear their conversation. The Lunar Module Pilot will call out these numbers for the angle at which the Commander can see the landing site on a grid on his window called the Landing Point Designator. During the final descent phase of the touchdown, the Lunar Module Pilot will be calling out the landing radar readouts of H and H dot, that is altitude and descent rate respectively. The so-called low level of propellant quantities will be called out when the propellant quantities reach 5. 8 percent. At that time, the burn time remaining will be approximately 111 seconds - 91 seconds into this margin. There's a point called "Bingo". This is the point where the Commander has to make the decision to go ahead and land or to begin vertical motion and then abort stage in case it's a no-go situation on the landing. He has approximately 20 seconds to make this decision to land. The CapCom, in this case, Jim Irwin, or the Orion, will be make this call of level and Bingo to the crew at the appropriate times. Some 19 seconds away from predicted acquisition as Orion and Casper come around the Moon and Casper meanwhile will have circularized. 25 minutes, 47 seconds from ignition, We should have acquisition now. We're standing by for that.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> It remains to be seen whether the steerable antenna on the Orion is functioning properly as we come around on Revolution 13. In any case, whether it works or not, we're still Go for landing at this point. Displays here in Mission Control have switched from the lunar orbit back ground projection plotters to the X-Y plotters of altitude, velocity and so on. Colored lines that are driven by radar, for the descent and landing phase. We have AOS on Lunar Module Orion. Let's switch on to air-ground.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 11 13 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. How do you read?</p> <a name="CM098_11_16"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 11 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay; they're locking up on me. Hello, Houston. This is Casper Bar [?] now. We did not do [the] Circ [burn], and I'd like to talk about the TVC servo loops.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 11 29 Hartsfield:</b> Understand. No Circ.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 11 33 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. Presently, about a mile ahead of the LM. And I'd like to talk about a TVC servo loop problem.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 11 51 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 11 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and - and break in and tell me as soon as you get the DS - get ready to dump the DSE, so you can take a look at what I'm talking about, and I'll leave the antenna Manual and Wide until you do. Okay; the text is that we came up to the burn time and I was going through the gimbal checks. Number 1 servo started normally, checked out. I switched to - clockwise on the THC to perform the secondary gimbal check and started them - they looked normal. I set the pitch trim normally, and I went to set the yaw trim; I'd just been checking that the trim lock [?] worked, and I got divergent oscillations on the yaw trim indicator, and you could feel them in the spacecraft. So I switched to the - Servo Power to the Number 2 Servo to AC1/Main A, tried that. That had no effect. Then I cycled through looking at - at the gimbal - with the Auto Drive switch in Number 1, Number 2 in Auto. Every time I selected Number 2, by some means, I had the same results. Then I tried SCS in Auto, and as soon as I would excite some motion in the secondary yaw servo, why it would go unstable again. I then tried using the G&amp;N to drive the gimbal, and I did the first half of the gimbal drive in Servo Loop 1, then switched to the Servo Loop 2 for the second half, and again the same instability showed up. Based on the [mission] rule of four servo loops, I canceled Circ. I had no other indications in the cockpit, no warning lights, no - no other abnormalities.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 13 58 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 14 01 Mattingly:</b> The [garble] was in fact running, but I don't think that could have had any effect when SCS was going.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 14 10 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Could we get you to go to the AOS attitude, Ken, so we can dump the data?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 14 20 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. Will do.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 14 25 Mattingly:</b> How about if I just give you the high gain from right here?</p>
      <p class="ed">[CM on board transcript ends until 099:16:32]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 14 31 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, if you think you can get it up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 15 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I've got you a solid lock on the high gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 15 40 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. We'd like to verify that...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 15 40 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I prefer this attitude, Hank, because I can keep the LM in sight.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 15 41 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] So I can keep the LM in sight.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 15 54 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we'd like to verify that the - that the oscillations were on servo loop Number 2. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 00 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. Servo loop Number 2, yaw only.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 08 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And servo loop Number 1 is okay?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 11 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 18 Hartsfield:</b> And did I read that the first time through the servo checks, they were okay? And then when you started to set the yaw trim, the oscillation started, and that once you had the malfunction, it occurred in...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 31 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. No, sir. Primary loop checked out normally. Secondary loop never checked out in yaw servo. </p>

      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 43 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] started normally, and it's - Go ahead, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 49 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And that occurred both in SCS and G&amp;N, is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 16 56 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. And I tried both Auto and Rate Command in SCS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 17 21 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, We'd like to confirm that was a divergent oscillation. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 17 28 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p> <a name="CM098_19_08"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 19 08 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. We'd like for you to run another gimbal drive check in the yaw axis on both SCS and G&amp;N, and let us take a look at it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 19 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I'm prepared to do that right now if you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 19 24 Hartsfield:</b> Ready to go.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>098 20 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay, here comes - You just wanted to look at the yaw. Here comes Yaw number 2. There it is, and it's oscillating now, and it's damped out, and that's in Auto. I'll switch it to Number 2, and Number 2 in Auto. I'm now going to move the , and it - Well, now it's - there it goes - now it's oscillating, and it's divergent, and I'm turning the Gimbals Off. Okay, Yaw Gimbal Number 2 is Off.

You're still very scratchy, hardly make you out at all. Yeah, that's pretty bad. That's not much better; it's not near like what we got before. Let's go back to A Simplex.</p>

      <p class="pao">Public Affairs Officer: This is Apollo Control. There's a rather busy huddle around the Flight Director's console here at Mission Control as all the options for the current situation in the mission are considered. Shall we continue to troubleshoot the problem with the Command Service Module Stabilization [and] Control System or shall we proceed with re-rendezvous and a Trans-Earth Injection burn at several hours hence. The possibility is still open for troubleshooting the problem with the system that controls the Service Propulsion System, and just landing at a later time. We are hopeful that before Loss of Signal on this 12th revolution of Apollo 16 that the decision will be made. At 98:46, this is Apollo Control.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>098 56 14 Mattingly:</b> Mark. And Yaw Gimbal number 1. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>098 56 19 Mattingly:</b> Mark. I have a thumb-wheel drive. I'm driving it from zero to minus one-half to plus one-half, which is the trim. The Yaw thumb-wheel is at plus one half. I'm going to take it to zero and back up to 1, and will set it at 122. It runs smoothly in both directions. I'm making an MTVC check in Pitch. There's a little plus Pitch, a little minus Pitch - that's good - a little minus Yaw, a little plus Yaw. That's good and stable. I'm going to CMC Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. Aboard the Command Module, Ken Mattingly is troubleshooting the SCS reading out what his onboard indications are. Let's listen to that for awhile, and switch away from Orion.</p>

I'm taking the trim, which is now set at a little over 1 on the thumb-wheel, down towards zero. I move it slowly. It gets a little dynamics, and then it stops. I'm going to take it down to zero at about this rate. It oscillates, and now it's diverging, and I'm turning the Gimbal Motor Off. I'm going to hold in this configuration.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control 99 hours and 1 minute Ground Elapsed Time. Flight Director Gerry Griffin is instructing the two spacecraft communicators to brief the crew on the current situation. And which apparently we have as long as five lunar orbits to make a determination on the feasibility of continuing with the landing, or whether we'll have to rendezvous with the two spacecraft back together, and do an immediate return to Earth. Assuming that the Service Propulsion System would be inoperative. We're some 14 minutes away from Loss of Signal with the Command Module. We will monitor the discussion between the spacecraft communicator, and the crew Orion, and Mattingly in Casper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 02 38 Hartsfield:</b> Hello, Orion and Casper. This is Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 02 47 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. It looks like we're not going to have a decision on this rev, and we do have the capability of spending about five revs in this configuration before we have to make that decision. We would like y'all to move into a station-keeping position, and you should be at the closest point of approach at about 100 hours, and we're recommending a CSM active to move into a position and to station-keep. And we're gonna run some simulations down here on this TVC problem, and we'll get back to you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 03 32 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, this is Houston. You copied, too, didn't you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 03 37 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 03 38 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I'm with you. I still have the - some of the gimbal motors on and the bus ties. Want to stand by on that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 03 43 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We'd like to try one more thing. There's a remote possibility that the RHC may be inducing some noise or transients into the system. We'd like you to kill all power to the RHC. Cut off both AC and DC, and repeat the gimbal check in AC Accel Command and see if the gimbal takes off. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 04 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I've got - I secured the hand controller by just taking Normal 2 Power to Off, and the rest of the Powers were Off. I'm in Accel Command on Yaws and I'm going Number 2 up to Start, and it's in Accel, and it's stable. Would you like for me to try the thumbwheels?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>099 08 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm now in - I'm in S - in CMC Control. I'm setting up 204, and I have program 509 loaded. I'm starting Gimbal number 2 Yaw. Okay. It's stable now. I'm going to do a Proceed on 204.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 99 hours, 11 minutes into the mission of Apollo 16. To recap the current situation, the crews of both vehicles Casper and Orion have been instructed to station-keep as they come to their closest approach during the next pass behind the Moon, with the Command Service Module being active in the rendezvous. We have some five hours to resolve the current problem which consists of difficulty by Ken Mattingly in getting the Thrust Vector Control System which keeps the Service Propulsion Engine aligned through the center of gravity on the Command Service Module. At the same time people on the ground, here in Mission Control and over in the Training Building are running simulations to attempt to develop a bypass or a workaround for the situation that Ken Mattingly has encountered and as preparations for the circularization burn. Some three minutes away from Loss Of Signal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 12 14 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. You can go ahead and shut down the gimbal motors, and turn off the TV servo loops - TVC servo loops, and clean it up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 12 26 Mattingly:</b> All right, sir. I'll power down. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. One slight correction. We have five revolutions which amounts to ten hours in which to make the decision before the geometry of the two spacecraft orbits would dictate no landing, would be out of plane with the landing site beyond the capability of the Descent Propulsion System to steer into the landing site. To repeat again, that is five revolutions instead of five hours.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 13 12 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. I've been advised that the average g kills your EMP.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>099 14 48 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS, and when you come around next time, in that rendezvous, just come up on the best omni, and then we'll get high gain from there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>099 15 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. And is there anything else you can think of we can do - we might try and take a look at? Otherwise, we'll just be station-keeping so.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>099 24 00 Duke (LM comm):</b> Ah so. Well, I never did think it was a good idea to run those gimbal motors that long.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 24 13 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, I guess they're having some of those kind of thoughts right now, too.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 24 19 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah. Those once in a million problems like that coarse align, and everybody gets boresighted on it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 24 33 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, I guess we really need to wait and see [garble] really want. You never know, those guys might come through here and find a way to take you down. Thought that it would hold its position with an external force on it, we could control the problem pretty good by using the - just using the proper trims to start the burn.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 24 59 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 25 01 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> But if you just count on the external forces not moving it, then I don't know what you do. I was thinking maybe we could use it in Accel Command with - just set the proper trim and immediately go to SCS and Accel Command, point it the right direction.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 26 18 Young (LM onboard):</b> [Garble] that pulse. [Garble]</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 26 25 Young (LM onboard):</b> You sleeping?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 26 27 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Was I sleeping? I was almost asleep.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 26 37 Young (LM onboard):</b> I bet my bride is beside herself.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 26 41 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 27 12 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Well, we'll be two revs late, but we'll do it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 27 16 Young (LM onboard):</b> I hope you're right.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 27 28 Young (LM onboard):</b> We ain't gonna do any EVA today, either.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 27 30 Duke (LM onboard):</b> You don't want to?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 27 32 Young (LM onboard):</b> Not for two revs, Charlie. Let's do it tomorrow and do the full thing.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 27 54 Young (LM onboard):</b> What's it do, bend?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 27 59 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Probably the first dish, yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 28 34 Duke (LM onboard):</b> He's dropping down out the bottom of the window.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 26 54 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> We're now passing right [garble] through Scorpio.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 28 58 Young (LM comm):</b> Yep.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 29 00 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Did find out that once we got the LM off there that the - we'd be able to see it a lot better. I guess the telescope just wiped out the [garble] the LM.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 29 39 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> What's the limitation of how long you can stay before - you can't go down?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 29 44 Young (LM comm):</b> Five revs.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 29 46 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> No, I mean what's the limiting factor? Is it water?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 29 49 Young (LM comm):</b> No. We got plenty of water.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 29 51 Duke (LM comm):</b> We could - we can land and just do a couple of EVAs.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 29 56 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I just wondered what - how they came up with five revs - was it water or what [garble]?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 02 Young (LM comm):</b> Got no idea.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 03 Duke (LM comm):</b> I don't know.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 13 Duke (LM comm):</b> Light still on?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 16 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, ours is.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 18 Duke (LM comm):</b> No, I mean the RCS light.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 26 Young (LM comm):</b> What's the pressure? </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 29 Duke (LM comm):</b> It's 210.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 47 Duke (LM comm):</b> I think we got enough ullage in there, in the tanks to -</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 30 55 Young (LM comm):</b> Just let it go? It's not firing anymore?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 31 02 Duke (LM comm):</b> Well, I don't know.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 31 13 Duke (LM comm):</b> I don't think we ought to fire anymore.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 31 33 Duke (LM comm):</b> It's probably that thermal blanket blew off and caused this thing to overpressurize.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 31 39 Young (LM comm):</b> Probably right, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 31 43 Duke (LM comm):</b> But the temps are good.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, 99 hours, 31 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16. To recap the current situation here in Mission Control Center, various considerations are underway on whether or not to continue the mission with a later landing or to have the two spacecraft, Orion and Casper, rendezvous, dock and do a Trans-Earth Injection burn using the Lunar Module's Descent Propulsion System. This would assume of course that the Service Propulsion System on the Command Module is inoperative, because of the apparent problem in the SCS or Stabilization Control System, which in turn drives and controls the SPS system, aboard the Command Service Module. We have something in the neighborhood of five revolutions or about 10 hours in which to reach the decision on the outcome of the lunar landing. As Orion came around the East limb of the Moon this last revolution in preparation for Power Descent Initiation, they were prepared for the landing. However Casper, piloted by Ken Mattingly, reported that he had not made the Circularization Burn. Since that time there have been many huddles here in the Control Room; engineers are going over drawings in the back rooms, simulations are underway here at the Manned Spacecraft Center to determine the nature of the Service Propulsion System control problem and hopefully by the time the crew comes around the corner again some 31 minutes from now at least some clarity will come out of the situation. But as mentioned earlier it may take the entire five revolutions. The limit of five revolutions has to do with the orbital geometry because after that time the orbital plain of the Lunar Module would be - would have drifted so far away from the landing site that the - there's not ample propellant to steer into the Descartes landing area from the present orbit without a [orbital] plane change. At 99:34, and 30 minutes and 30 seconds from acquisition of signal [from] both spacecraft, this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 33 21 Duke (LM comm):</b> Is that sunrise?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 33 27 Young (LM comm):</b> Yep.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 33 30 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Did you say you had sunrise, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 33 32 Duke (LM comm):</b> It's coming up. We can see it glowing beyond the horizon.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 33 36 Young (LM comm):</b> It's gonna be instant sunrise.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 33 39 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> [Garble] doing? Man, looks like [garble] dark as ever.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 33 45 Duke (LM comm):</b> It's behind you, Ken.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 33 46 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, it's behind you, boy. When it comes up, we won't be able to see you anymore.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 33 52 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; I've got you boresighted.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 33 54 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 34 15 Young (LM comm):</b> Be kind of hard to get a radar lock. Oh, no.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 35 24 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeow!</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 35 25 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Boy! Did you ever brighten up in a hurry!</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 35 34 Young (LM comm):</b> It was long before we got there, though, that we saw it, right?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 35 37 Duke (LM comm):</b> Right. Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 35 38 Young (LM comm):</b> Do you reckon light bends?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 35 40 Duke (LM comm):</b> Huh?</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>099 37 40 Young (LM comm):</b> We were Go for PDI there for a while.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 37 43 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 37 46 Young (LM comm):</b> I can't - I can't believe it. I can't believe it (laughter). We'd had no trouble at all picking up the site either.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 37 54 Duke (LM comm):</b> I know; it's beautiful. I guess you can't win them all.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 38 10 Young (LM comm):</b> I'm not getting any cooling at all, Charlie. Are you?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 38 13 Duke (LM comm):</b> Cooling?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 38 14 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 38 15 Duke (LM comm):</b> A little bit out of the suit. Not much.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 38 22 Young (LM comm):</b> Why don't you go to LGC on a - for a second or two?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 38 42 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 13 Young (LM comm):</b> Charlie, we ought to have an eat period is what we ought to do. You ain't hungry?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 20 Duke (LM comm):</b> No.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 22 Young (LM comm):</b> How about something to drink, or something like that?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 24 Duke (LM comm):</b> Back there in the food locker.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 36 Duke (LM comm):</b> I don't want anything, really.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 38 Young (LM comm):</b> You don't? Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 42 Duke (LM comm):</b> Unless they got a sandwich or something back there. I'll eat that.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 49 Young (LM comm):</b> All they got is those drinks, Charlie. Those orange drinks.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 39 57 Duke (LM comm):</b> Wait a minute. Open the top, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 40 01 Young (LM comm):</b> I don't want to get too close to the hatch.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 40 04 Duke (LM comm):</b> Ain't nothing wrong with the hatch. It's okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 40 15 Duke (LM comm):</b> Those two on the left come open.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 40 18 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, I know it, if I can get to them.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 40 38 Young (LM comm):</b> See. Those orange drinks.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 40 50 Duke (LM comm):</b> What's all that's in there, is orange drinks?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 40 52 Young (LM comm):</b> Well, there's some stuff behind it, but I can't get at it. I'm not - I just can't. I - I could reach it with the moving the orange drinks, but if I do, I don't know what I'm gonna do with them.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 41 06 Duke (LM comm):</b> Put them in the Flight Data File up here. There's plenty of room up here.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 41 47 Duke (LM comm):</b> Oh, oh. Excuse me.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 41 48 Young (LM comm):</b> Son of a gun, I keep - I keep getting them things.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 41 58 Young (LM comm):</b> In this one?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 41 59 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah. Either one.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 42 03 Young (LM comm):</b> Don't think there is plenty of room in there. No, there ain't. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 42 19 Young (LM comm):</b> Man, there is more pieces of metal around this spacecraft! You want a food stick?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 42 28 Duke (LM comm):</b> It won't go in there?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 42 31 Young (LM comm):</b> Might if I fold them in half.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 42 32 Duke (LM comm):</b> Stick them into the ISA then.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 42 41 Young (LM comm):</b> There we go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 42 51 Young (LM comm):</b> I'd hate for any of that stuff to get loose in zero gravity. It would be a mess.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 43 07 Young (LM comm):</b> Charlie, you got me almost to PDI there.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 43 11 Duke (LM comm):</b> Well, I tried hard.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 43 12 Young (LM comm):</b> You did good.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 43 18 Duke (LM comm):</b> But if the gear don't work. Well, maybe they'll come up with something.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 43 27 Young (LM comm):</b> How about a food stick? Can I have a food stick, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 43 30 Duke (LM comm):</b> Sure.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 43 59 Young (LM comm):</b> Don't know where he is now.</p> <a name="099_44_01"></a>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 44 01 Duke (LM comm):</b> Probably down below him. Below us, rather. Hey, Ken, they want you to rendezvous at 100 hours, wherever that is.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 44 10 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I thought they said that was our closest point of approach, and it sure doesn't look to me like it's gonna be. Looks like we passed it back there about 20 minutes ago.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 44 19 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah, I - I agree with you. They want you to be active.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 44 24 Young (LM comm):</b> There is no way they can tell what it is or, these short things; they don't have any idea where we are, Charlie - Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 44 38 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Charlie, I'm going to try reacquire range and make sure I don't have a bad rate.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 44 43 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay, I got 0.68 on the...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 44 45 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I got 0.52. Let me reacquire and we'll try it again.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 44 52 Young (LM comm):</b> That - What is that? That's not 1678.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 44 55 Duke (LM comm):</b> No, that's...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 44 56 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Say, could you could stay off the mike while I get it working?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 45 16 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay, I have reacquired the LM. 0.55.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 45 20 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay; you can start closing if you want, I guess.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 45 25 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I guess I will. I was gonna watch - watch the Sun here. It should scoot back around any minute.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 45 31 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, just be - Hey, if you want us to give you range and range rate, we'll lock on you. How about that?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 45 37 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm sorry. I didn't understand what you said, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 45 39 Young (LM comm):</b> We should lock on you and give you range and range rate.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 45 43 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, I thought you were saying you didn't have your radar, and I thought that made good sense. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 45 47 Duke (LM comm):</b> No. We got plenty.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 45 49 Young (LM comm):</b> We've got plenty of radar. We're going to do it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 45 51 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I thought you were trying to save on your amps.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 45 54 Young (LM comm):</b> No. No, we got plenty of amps.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 45 57 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay. Well, that would help. That's better than this thing.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 45 59 Young (LM comm):</b> Dang right. Where are - Which way should we pitch to get to you?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 46 05 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Beg your pardon?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 46 06 Young (LM comm):</b> Which way should we pitch to get to you?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 46 09 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Oh. Well, let me see here. All - Oh, boy. It's hard to tell what figures I'm looking at, it's so bright. I think I'm looking at the top of you, though.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 46 26 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 46 28 Duke (LM comm):</b> That's what it says, pitch up.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 46 32 Young (LM comm):</b> [Garble], Well, you can't believe that, Charlie. We ain't updated it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 46 35 Duke (LM comm):</b> Huh?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 46 36 Young (LM comm):</b> We ain't updated it or nothing.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 46 38 Duke (LM comm):</b> I said - Oh, you mean the radar?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 47 35 Young (LM comm):</b> I don't see him anywhere.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 47 42 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> That's superbright. That must be - maybe I'm looking at the heat shield around your engine. That's probably it, because I can see the four gear. You - you must be pitched 180 to me.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 47 57 Duke (LM comm):</b> That's what I thought. He's been going in under us.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 48 03 Young (LM comm):</b> Well, why did you say pitch up?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 48 05 Duke (LM comm):</b> I didn't say that, Ken did.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 48 09 Young (LM comm):</b> (Laughter) You ain't gonna take credit for it, huh? [Garble] I'd have swore I heard you say pitch up.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 48 16 Duke (LM comm):</b> Well, that's what the AGS says, but that ain't right.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 48 20 Young (LM comm):</b> Well, it must have been - You know...</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 48 21 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 48 22 Young (LM comm):</b> ...you can't - Anything less than a mile, these things ain't no good. Because - Well, AGS is okay. But this thing here measures from the center of the Moon. I don't have the foggiest notion where our boy is.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 49 32 Young (LM comm):</b> Hear that noise?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 49 35 Duke (LM comm):</b> It's in the comm. Oh, that whooooo? Oh, yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 49 42 Young (LM comm):</b> That's what I mean.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 49 43 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 49 44 Young (LM comm):</b> We were back here - It's got something to do with the VHF ranging.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 02 Young (LM comm):</b> Boy, I don't see him anywheres.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 06 Duke (LM comm):</b> Think we got quite a ways to pitch yet.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 08 Young (LM comm):</b> Oh, shoot. Do it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 16 Young (LM comm):</b> There he is. Yeah, he's way far away from us. I think what the problem is, Ken...</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 21 Duke (LM comm):</b> There he is, dead ahead.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 22 Young (LM comm):</b> ...is you're opening up.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 24 Duke (LM comm):</b> Dead ahead.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 27 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, that's a good idea.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 51 32 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I agree with you.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 51 33 Young (LM comm):</b> You want to be careful how much velocity you add, because you're too low to add a lot. Or...</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>099 55 41 Duke (LM comm):</b> He'll drop way down. You know, if he - if he fires this way, it's retrograde; it's gonna drop him low - lower his orbit.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 55 55 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, how much did you put in?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 55 57 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I put in a total of 3.5 [feet per second or 1.0 metres per second].</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 56 01 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay. Well, that's gonna get you right close to the ground.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo control 99 hours, 56 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16. Some seven minutes, 40 seconds away from acquisition on the 14th lunar revolution. To recap again the current situation in the mission, the circularization burn for command module Casper was aborted when Ken Mattingly discovered some discrepancies in the backup system which control the Service Propulsion Engine. We still have a good prime system, that is a Guidance and Navigation system aboard the Command Module, however, we would be one failure away for the very critical Trans-Earth Injection maneuver which requires a fairly lengthy burn and a stable engine bell from the Service Propulsion System; therefore, quite a few people here in Houston and at the spacecraft manufacturer in Downey, California are looking into the ramifications of the backup system having apparently failed would this present any structural strain on the spacecraft if the engine bell went to full yaw, and would we be able to do a successful Trans Earth Injection with this engine. As all of these questions are answered the decision will be made whether or not to continue with the landing phase or to rendezvous and do a Trans Earth Injection burn using the Descent Engine on the Lunar Module, Orion. We have about five revolutions or some 10 hours in total time in which to make this decision. This, again, is dictated by the orbital mechanics. The fact that the Lunar Module would drift away from the desired ground track for the landing site at Descartes during any time past these five revolutions. The Gold Team of flight controllers will stay on duty in the Control Center for the landing if a decision is made to land. If the decision is made to rendezvous and do a docked descent propulsion burn to bring the spacecraft home, Pete Frank's Orange Team will take over. Some 4 minutes, 37 seconds now away from acquisition and at 100 hours, even, this is Apollo control.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 56 28 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Am I closing any yet?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 56 32 Young (LM comm):</b> No. It - it'll take half a rev.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 56 34 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay, I'm not sure - it seemed to me like they gave us bum dope on this 100 hours.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 56 44 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, you know they have no idea where we are.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 56 47 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, but they know where we undocked and we haven't done anything. Think they ought to...</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 56 51 Young (LM comm):</b> No, no. There's no way. Not for short ranges like this.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 57 24 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I really wanted to get within half a rev. I guess that ought to be a radial burn, shouldn't it?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 57 30 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay. We show you closing slightly now, about a half a foot a second.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 57 35 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>099 57 54 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, it shows it took me down to 8.6. But as long as I stick with you, I can't get too far away.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>099 59 02 Duke (CM comm):</b> I guess the five revs might have been, John, the - the high gain coverage they got, since our steerable doesn't work. We can go as long as we got the 210.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 59 15 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 59 22 Duke (LM comm):</b> It's going to be hard to run - He's going to take a lot of gas to get over here.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 59 27 Young (LM comm):</b> Should have took it out.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 59 31 Duke (LM comm):</b> Huh?</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>099 59 47 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I thrusted toward you 3.5. Yeah that was - looks like mostly retrograde.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>099 59 55 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah. Looks like to me you're gonna have to go up a little bit now, a couple of feet a second.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 00 04 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Have you got some kind of a chart there I could navigate with?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 00 07 Young (LM comm):</b> No, we sure don't.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 00 08 Duke (LM comm):</b> No. But, see, that retrograde burn is going to take you down, below us.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 00 15 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Roger. I understand that. It really looks like what I want to do is make a radial burn, you behind me. I really ought to make a radial burn now, shouldn't I?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 00 33 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah. Shouldn't he?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 00 35 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> How about let's do that?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 00 41 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 00 44 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> What's my range and range rate now?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 00 47 Duke (LM comm):</b> 0.680 feet a second [0.21 metres per second].</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 01 28 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay. There's 0.5 foot per second 0.15 metres per second] radial out. ["0.4 foot per sec" in LM tape]</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 01 33 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 02 09 Duke (LM comm):</b> Man, it's really white into zero phase, isn't it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 02 25 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Sure looks to me like I'm opening again.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 02 29 Duke (LM comm):</b> Well, we got you about zero, Ken, maybe closing slightly. I think it's gonna take a couple of feet per second radial.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 02 49 Young (LM comm):</b> He's got to go up like that. But with our mechanics, it may not do anything.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 03 04 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I guess I'm getting a little concerned about that minus-X I put in there.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 03 18 Young (LM comm):</b> Guess I don't blame you. I'd have thought you'd have put in plus-X and rose over the top of us.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 03 25 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I think I'm gonna take it back out and go the other way. That sound reasonable?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 03 36 Duke (LM comm):</b> Sure does to me, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 03 55 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay; here we go.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 04 27 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay, there's two - two power.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 04 30 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay, now that shows you're opening at 3 and a - that shows you're opening at 3 [feet per second - 0.9 metres per second].</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 04 44 Duke (LM comm):</b> Here comes Earthrise. See it?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 04 52 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 04 53 Duke (LM comm):</b> That's spectacular.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 04 58 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah. Now according to our mechanics, you're bound to end up behind us, and close to us.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>100 05 07 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay. That shows I got a 59 by 9 [nautical mile, 109 by 17 kilometres orbit].</p> <a name="100_03"></a>

      <p class="tech"><b>100 36 19 Young (LM):</b> Yes, they're nulled right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 36 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay - They are going to keep building this way, and do we have some - some fuel point at which to cut off and switch over to LM power. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 36 36 Young (LM):</b> How much are you using?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 36 XX Mattingly:</b> Well, it's really showing, and I don't know how much more we're going to see on the way in and I'm reading - of course, these gages don't tell you exactly what it is, but I have - That's 65 percent showing on B. And all this stuff is going to be in the - in the [garble]. Houston, you got any thoughts on a cut-off point on the RCS?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 37 15 Irwin:</b> Stand by, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 37 17 Young (LM):</b> Okay, well, you're at 4000 feet [1200 metres] now, at 5 feet [1.5 metres] a second, Ken.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 37 20 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 37 21 Young (LM):</b> And - and - and your line-of-sight rate is starting to build a little in the other direction. You've got it now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 37 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay, hopefully, that's most of it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 37 54 Irwin:</b> Orion, this is Houston. Is the CSM above you or below you? We hope he's directly ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 38 07 Young (LM):</b> He's at 45 degrees above us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 38 11 Irwin:</b>: Forty-five degrees above.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 38 15 Young (LM):</b> Above the local vertical.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 38 18 Irwin:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 38 29 Young (LM):</b> And, he's got a - a 5-foot-a-second closing rate, and his line of sights are nulled on the radar.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 38 34 Irwin:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 38 43 Mattingly:</b> And they look like they are killed completely on the optics too. Going to need your tracker light here in a minute. We're just getting a little glinted sunlight now.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>100 39 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 09 Duke (LM onboard):</b> The one that was down - then it was up, he was thrusting -</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 14 Young (LM onboard):</b> Toward the Moon...</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 15 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 16 Young (LM onboard):</b> ...away from the Moon.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 17 Duke (LM onboard):</b> It was down for him.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 18 Young (LM onboard):</b> It was opposite.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 19 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah. They're just opposite of what we're looking at.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 39 20 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 39 31 Mattingly:</b> Boy, those rates look steady as they can be.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 39 33 Young (LM):</b> You've really got them killed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 39 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and since we are going to get rendezvoused in the dark - I guess we'll just come up alongside and hold stations.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 40 05 Young (LM):</b> That seems like a fair thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 40 09 Mattingly:</b> All right, sir.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 40 41 Young (LM onboard):</b> Would - would it be easier to thrust down now?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 40 46 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 40 50 Young (LM):</b> Okay, Ken. You're going to have to thrust down a hair.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 40 57 Mattingly:</b> That's down to you, right? </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 40 56 Duke (LM onboard):</b> It looks - it would be up to us, Ken. I think if we thrusted, we'd have to thrust up. I think you have to thrust down a skosh.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 05 Mattingly:</b> Yes [garble]. Yes, that's what I mean, you would thrust - you would thrust up. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 41 07 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I think I got it killed again.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>100 41 12 Young (LM onboard):</b> Looks pretty good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 17 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> What's that closing rate now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 19 Young (LM):</b> Looks pretty good. Still five feet a second. Still off 3½ feet [1.1 metres] a second now at 3000 [900 metres].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 23 Mattingly:</b> 3½ feet per second.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 41 25 Young (LM onboard):</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 26 Mattingly (CM):</b> Okay, all I've got's the tracking light; I've lost the rest of your image.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 32 Young (LM):</b> Okay. You've - you're gonna have to thrust a little more to kill that rate the same way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 48 Young (LM):</b> Okay. That got a lot of it, but not all of it. Okay. You got most of it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 41 58 CC-CM/LM:</b> Okay, Casper. This is Houston. You might pick up a temperature caution light on your quads, but it's of no consequence.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Yes, I see B is up high. Is that due to the thruster activity?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 14 Irwin:</b> Affirmative, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 15 Mattingly:</b> Or is that due to heater fail-on?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 19 Irwin:</b> I think it's thruster activity.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 28 Irwin:</b> Orion, this is Houston. Will you give us another range and range rate, John?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 35 Young (LM):</b> Yep. They're at 3100 feet [950 metres], at 3½.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 44 Young (LM):</b> Roger. At an angle of 68 degrees to local vertical now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 42 50 Irwin:</b> Understand; 68 degrees.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 43 23 Young (LM onboard):</b> I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe we're doing this. Turn on some more water.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 43 33 Young (LM):</b> Okay, Ken. You got a sight rate going to the south according to my needles.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 43 49 Young (LM onboard):</b> Whoa, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 43 50 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Whoa.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 43 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let's watch that for a minute before I start working on it, because we haven't had any plane component before.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 43 58 Mattingly:</b> How's the line-of-sight rate doing now? Holding?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 44 01 Young (LM onboard):</b> It's holding. It's holding - the vertical one is holding right on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And range rate?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 02 Young (LM):</b> Holding - holding the vertical, and it's holding right on. You're at 3000 feet [900 metres], at 3 feet [0.9 metres] a second. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 17 Mattingly (CM):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 44 18 Young (LM comm):</b> 2800 feet [850 metres].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 21 Mattingly:</b> Now we must be going in the right direction then. Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 25 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, you're gonna get there. You now have 2 milliradians to the south. Yep.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll take some of that out. That means I go to the south, right?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 44 42 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 49 Mattingly:</b> How's that? Right direction?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 44 51 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, that's got most of it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 45 13 Irwin:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 45 21 Young (LM):</b> You still got some more to the south you've got to get. Still 2 milliradians. Okay. That's got it, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 45 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 46 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay, it looks like I'm picking up a rate in the opposite direction in the - - the in-plane component. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 46 26 Young (LM):</b> No, you're not - you're not - You don't have any rate yet. According to my needles.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 45 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay. All right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 46 43 Mattingly:</b> This is very much like the simulator where, because of the dead band lags, it looks like it takes a long time to pick up one of those rates.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 47 04 Irwin:</b> Orion, this is Houston. We want you to get the rendezvous radar and the tracking light off as soon as it's feasible, to conserve power.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 47 15 Young (LM):</b> Roger. We will. It's not too feasible right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 47 21 Irwin:</b> Yes, we understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 47 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay, it looks like I may be a little more to the south.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 47 39 Young (LM):</b> Just a hair, Ken. Okay. You're at 2400 feet [730 metres] at 2 [feet, 0.6 metres, per second].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 47 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 47 50 Duke (LM onboard):</b> He's going to need to thrust towards us a little bit.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 47 51 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 21 Young (LM onboard):</b> He thrusts the opposite way we do. We're up down.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 24 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 48 24 Mattingly:</b> How about that rate to the south? It looks like it's building again. Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 48 29 Young (LM):</b> Ken, our needles don't show it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 33 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 34 Duke (LM onboard):</b> He never really got it all out.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 46 Young (LM onboard):</b> Better start using their -</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 49 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Huh?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 50 Young (LM onboard):</b> Somebody better start using their brains and common sense here.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 53 Duke (LM onboard):</b> What do you mean?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 48 55 Young (LM onboard):</b> Or it'll blow the whole works.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 49 05 Duke (LM onboard):</b> You don't think this is right, what he's doing?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 49 07 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 49 15 Duke (LM onboard):</b> You want me to stick that card back over there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 49 23 Mattingly:</b> Hey, I show quite a drift rate now, John. Do you still show no out of plane?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 49 29 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, I don't show any, and I've got you boresighted in Att Hold, and I don't show any motion there either, Ken.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 49 35 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Where? Our needles say he's drifting south.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 49 42 Young (LM):</b> Just a little south, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 49 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It looks like it's pretty good bet. I'm going to take some of that out.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. Flight Director, Gerry Griffin, has instructed the CapCom to tell the crew that at acquisition of signal on Rev 15 - that's in spite of the next revolution - they'll be given a Go/No-Go for a landing on Rev 16. Hopefully be that time the situation will have resolved itself on the Thrust Vector Control System which drives the SPS. Apparently there is a problem in the yaw gimbal actuator in the Service Propulsion System. The decision has not yet been made, and hopefully will be made prior to the time of acquisition of signal on Revolution 15. Some 19 minutes remaining in this 14th revolution. Add to that 47 minutes of backside pass, and at - start of that rev we'll either be Go for landing (or) for immediate rendezvous (and) docking, and subsequent return home. This is Apollo Control at 100 hours, 51 minutes.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 49 59 Duke (LM onboard):</b> He's going off the bellyband.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 50 00 Mattingly:</b> Can you tell if I'm going to - maybe I put that in the wrong direction, although I'm sure that that was the right - South is to your left, isn't it? </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 50 12 Young (LM onboard):</b> You betcha.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 50 13 Mattingly (CM):</b> Okay. We're going the right way, then.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 50 18 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Hey, wait a minute, Ken...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 50 06 Young (LM):</b> Whoa, Ken. You got it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 50 26 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay, Ken. You were drifting south. That's right. You have to thrust north. You got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 50 29 Mattingly:</b> John, we've been going the right direction all along, then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 50 32 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, you have. Yeah, don't worry about it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 50 34 Mattingly:</b> It appears to be I'm still a little bit out of plane. I guess that's the sensitivity of the rendezvous radar.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>100 50 55 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Down to one foot [0.3 metres] a second. If he'd get a little bit more closing rate in, it'd be less gas.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 51 07 Young (LM onboard):</b> I think it would be too.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>100 53 03 Young (LM):</b> Okay, fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 53 14 Young (LM):</b> You're getting over behind us, Ken. You're going to have to - to thrust toward us a little more.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 53 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay, what's my range rate now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 53 23 Young (LM):</b> You're at 2000 feet, but it's hardly closing at all.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>100 58 33 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir, in Earthshine I can see the whole LM now. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>100 58 34 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay, fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 58 35 Mattingly (CM):</b> I'm afraid we're going to run out of Earthshine here before we get it completed. How's the closure rate now? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 58 47 Young (LM):</b> Still 2 feet a second, Ken. We're about 1400 feet [430 metres] now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 59 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Man, that Moon in Earthshine is really something. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 59 06 Young (LM):</b> Okay; And I show you with 4 milliradians to the north, and I see you drifting slowly across the COAS to the north.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 59 11 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I didn't quite get it stopped. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 59 30 Mattingly:</b> That looks to me like that's fixed. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 59 25 Young (LM):</b> Okay, you're fixing it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>100 59 XX Mattingly:</b> You still show some residuals? </p>

      <p class="tech"><b>100 59 54 Irwin:</b> Orion, this is Houston. We're showing about ten minutes to LOS, and I have some words for you on our general plan, when it's convenient.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>101 00 04 Young (LM comm):</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 00 XX Irwin:</b> Okay, when you come up on AOS, on the next rev, Rev 15, we'll give you a Go or No-go for another try, and we'd be looking at PDI on Rev 16. And at that time, we'd have pads for you and procedures. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 00 29 Young (LM):</b> Okay. Fair enough.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 00 38 Irwin:</b> And, Casper; this is Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 00 43 Mattingly:</b> Go right ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 00 46 Irwin:</b> Roger. We want you to verify that you're in Auto Dump on the water. That's Pressure Relief in the number 2 position. That's vertical. And if you have an opportunity to get away from the controls there, we'd like you to manually dump the water to ten percent on the back side. That should require about 17 minutes. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 01 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I am in Auto Dump and I'll have to wait until we get in daylight to go down there, I think.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>101 01 20 Mattingly:</b> I show about full, but I guess it isn't.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>101 01 52 Young (LM):</b> Two feet a second. You have it. You're at a thousand feet [300 metres] now, approaching [garble].</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>101 02 02 Young (LM):</b> It's starting to go to the south of here. Don't worry about it right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 01 05 Mattingly:</b> All right.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>101 04 19 Mattingly:</b> All righty.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>101 04 26 Duke (LM onboard):</b> What a time to be closing, pitch black dark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 04 38 Young (LM):</b> 970 [295 metres]. You've got the line-of-sight rate. Okay; can you see me with the spotlight yet?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 04 50 Mattingly:</b> No, that's what I was looking to see, because we're going to lose Earthshine here in just a minute.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>101 05 27 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay, Ken. You've got to thrust down just a hair.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>101 05 39 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I'm not sure if that was the same [garble] you're talking about.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>101 05 41 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 05 49 Mattingly:</b> Does that fix it? </p>

      <p class="tech"><b>101 05 XX Mattingly:</b> It's really strange, it was sitting here in the COAS here, right in the middle.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 06 14 Young (LM):</b> You thrust a hair down and a hair to the north.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 06 18 Mattingly:</b> You're upside down compared to me, and when you say down you mean you're going - you're going down on me - is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 06 30 Young (LM):</b> I'm doing it from the needles. If you don't ro - if you haven't rolled from the last way you were doing it, we were doing it okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>101 06 35 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah. That's right, Ken. We're going down with you. We'd have to thrust up, according to the needle.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. We have loss of signal with both vehicles as they pass behind the Moon during the end of revolution number 14. At the start of Revolution 15 the crew of Apollo 16 still at this time station-keeping in the two vehicles. [They] will be given a Go/No-Go decision for powered descent and landing during Rev 16 which will be some 4 hours from now. If the decision is [for a] go, all of the maneuver timelines will have to be read up to the crew during the front-side pass of revolution number 15. If the decision is [for] no landing, then the crew would proceed to rendezvous, dock, and prepare the spacecraft for return home. To recap the situation, the planned circularization maneuver by the Command Service Module back prior to AOS on Revolution 13 was aborted by Ken Mattingly when he discovered that the backup system, [in] the Stabilization and Control System which in turn controls the gimbal actuators on the Service Propulsion System, apparently had a malfunction in the yaw direction - in other words the driver that moves the engine bell left and right apparently had some excursions of several degrees and fairly rapid amplitude, [in] fairly rapid succession. Simulations are underway here at Houston and the Command Module simulator and some structural tests are underway at this time at the manufacturers plant [at] Downey in California to determine if indeed the problem would present any structural hazard to the spacecraft should the backup SCS system have to be used in SPS burns. Keep in mind, please, that the primary system - the G&amp;N system - is still in perfect condition, but the mission rules call for both systems being operational before we have a "go" for landing. Some 44 minutes remaining now until acquisition on Rev 15. During the next three quarters of an hour the decision should be firmed up on a go for landing Go/No-Go decision. And at 101 hours, 14 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16, This is Apollo Control.</p>
