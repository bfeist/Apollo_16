      <p class="ed">[The Apollo 16 spacecraft, together with the S-IVB third-stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, has almost completed its first orbit around the Earth. After a long transit across the Pacific, during which they were out of communication with Mission Control, John Young, Charlie Duke and Ken Mattingly are about to start the preparation for Trans Lunar Insertion - the firing of the S-IVB booster to send Apollo 16 out of Earth orbit and towards the Moon. To help readers find the more significant parts, the following is a short index of the main events.</p>

      <p class="ed">[The PAO means that the pressure has not released as planned. However, he is suggesting that the valve is releasing some pressure, if not as much as it is intended to.]</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control Houston. At one hour, 34 minutes.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>001 33 52 Duke:</b> Okay, how are you coming on the PADs, Gordy?</p> <a name="001_33_59"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>001 33 59 Fullerton:</b> Okay, I'm ready with the TLI plus 90 and the P37 for lift-off plus eight. We're putting together a story and looking at the APS module. No immediate action is necessary, so let's get the PADs out of the way.</p>
      <p class="ed">[<a name="pad"></a>Throughout the mission, large lists of numbers, called PADs, will be read up to the crew which give them the information necessary to carry out a particular manoeuvre. PAD stands for Pre-Advisory Data. Some of these "block data" are for planned manoeuvres such as the TLI (Translunar Injection) or LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion) burns. Other PADs, such as the "TLI plus 90" and "Lift-off plus 8" mentioned here are the first of 27 abort options which will be read up to the crew at scheduled times throughout the early and middle portions of the mission. Note that the TLI+90 PAD has nothing to do with TLI itself but would occur 90 minutes after a successful TLI burn in the event of an abort. However, mission planners have decided that at no time beyond Earth orbit will the crew be without a get-you-home PAD. If at any time the crew subsequently lose communication with Earth, they will have the information to hand to get themselves back manually.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[To simplify the voice transmission of these huge lists of numbers and reduce the likelihood of errors, each type of PAD was precisely formatted both in Mission Control's and the crew's paperwork - all the crew needed to do was fill in the blanks.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[The abort PADs are the responsibility of RETRO, one of the flight controllers in the front row of the MOCR (Mission Operations Control Room). According to Chuck Deiterich, who was one of those who occupied the RETRO console throughout Apollo, "There is quite a bit of protocol in the PAD process. Empty PADs were in tablets of no carbon required (NCR) paper. We would make about six copies and use a red ballpoint on the top (original) so the CapCom would be sure what was part of the printed form and what was data." (2003 correspondence).]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>001 34 08 Duke:</b> Okay, fine. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>001 34 13 Fullerton:</b> Okay, TLI plus 90, SPS/G&amp;N; the weight is 66973; minus 0.54, plus 1.89; time of ignition is 004:03:18.55; minus 0356.2, plus four balls 1, plus 3600.7; 181, 234, 002; HA is NA; HP, plus 0018.9; 3618.3, 5:04, 3602.0; sextant star is 26, 073.4. Stand by 1. We got a handover coming up; I'll get the rest in a minute.</p>
      <p class="ed">[As Fullerton reads the PAD, a complete P30 type, Charlie Duke copies the values to the appropriate form in the checklist. <img style="width: 400px; height: 561px;" alt="TLI Plus 90 PAD" src="pics/TLI90PAD.gif" align="right"></p>
      <p class="ed">[Interpretation of this particular PAD is as follows:</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Purpose:</b> In the event of a serious problem soon after a good Translunar Injection, this PAD has the details of a burn which would return them quickly to the Earth. It has an ignition time of 90 minutes after TLI. In the event of such an emergency, the SPS (Service Propulsion System) engine would be used to slow the spacecraft to below Earth escape velocity, resulting in a high altitude ballistic arc that would take them directly to splashdown without any further orbits. Full procedures for the TLI plus 90 abort are given on Page <a href="csmlc/a16L4-13.gif">L4-13</a> of the CSM Launch Checklist</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>System:</b> The burn would be under the control of the Guidance and Navigation System. Burns can also be controlled by the SCS (Stabilization Control System).</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>CSM weight (Noun 47):</b> Calculated to be 66,973 pounds (30,378 kilograms).</p>
      <p class="ed">Note that here, and in all the NASA documentation of the time, the term "weight" is freely used in the context where, strictly speaking, "mass" ought to be used. Weight is defined as the force applied by a mass in a gravity field. In free fall, mass remains the same while weight becomes essentially zero.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> -0.54&deg; and +1.89&deg;.</p>
      <p class="ed">The SPS engine bell is gimbal mounted to allow its thrust vector to be aligned with the spacecraft's computed centre of gravity. Two thumb wheels on the left of the Main Display Console allow adjustment of these pitch and yaw trim angles.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Time of ignition, T<sub>IG</sub> (Noun 33):</b> 4 hours, 3 minutes and 18.55 seconds, Ground Elapsed Time.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, -356.2 (-108.6);y, +0.1 (+0.03); z, +3,600.1 (+1,097.3). This is the change in velocity as defined along three orthogonal axes with respect to the local vertical/local horizontal.</p>
      <p class="ed">The three velocity components in a PAD are always expressed with respect to the local vertical/local horizontal. Imagine a coordinate system based on a line from the spacecraft to the centre of the Earth or Moon. (Which you use depends on the sphere of influence you are in, ie which gravitational field is stronger.) This line is the Z-axis and is vertical at the point where it intersects the surface. The X-axis is perpendicular to this in whatever direction the spacecraft's orbit is taking it. It is therefore parallel to the local horizontal. The Y-axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. This arrangement holds even for a very extended elliptical orbit like the one Apollo 16 will take to the Moon, where the spacecraft is clearly not travelling parallel to the local horizontal.</p>
      <p class="ed">In the above burn, we can see that the largest component of velocity change is in the plus-Z direction which is towards the Earth, countering the spacecraft's velocity away from the planet.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Spacecraft attitude at T<sub>ig</sub>:</b> Roll, 181&deg;; Pitch, 232&deg;; Yaw, 2&deg;.</p>
      <p class="ed">Although the velocity change is expressed with respect to the local horizontal, spacecraft attitude is expressed with respect to the current alignment of the guidance platform. That alignment is currently set to the launch pad <a target="new" href="acron.html#refsmmat">REFSMMAT</a>.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>H<sub>A</sub> and H<sub>P</sub> (Noun 44):</b> These are the heights of the resulting orbit's apogee and perigee, respectively. Since the computer cannot display an altitude higher than 9999.9 nautical miles, and the maximum height of the CSM during a TLI+90 abort will be much higher than that, H<sub>A</sub> is not applicable. The perigee of the "orbit" is targeted at 18.9 nautical miles (35.0 km). A perigee so low will intercept the Earth's atmosphere and cause the spacecraft to re-enter.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Delta-V<sub>T</sub>:</b> 3618.3 fps (1,103.8 m/s). This is the total velocity change that would be experienced by the spacecraft. It is a vector sum of the three components given earlier.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 5 minutes, 04 seconds.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub>:</b> 3,604.0 fps (1,098.5 m/s). This figure would be entered into the EMS (Entry Monitor System) Delta-V display.</p>
      <p class="ed">SPS engine burns are normally controlled by the G&amp;N system. If it is a long burn, that is, greater than six seconds, the control is closed loop. The system monitors the achieved Delta-V and shuts down the engine at the appropriate time. In doing this, it takes account of the engine tail-off impulse. It knows how the thrust expected from this tail-off and can calculate the resulting tail-off Delta-V based on this and the spacecraft mass.</p>
      <p class="ed">If the G&amp;N system were to fail during a burn, the EMS would provide a backup means of shutting down the engine at the right time. This equipment carries a separate accelerometer which measures Delta-V along the longitudinal axis of the spacecraft. Prior to the burn, the crew enter the expected Delta-V into a display on the EMS. As the burn progresses, the figure showing the remaining Delta-V drops towards zero, at which time the EMS itself shuts down the EMS if the G&amp;N system has not already done so. However, the EMS has no knowledge of the tail-off thrust. The flight controllers take this into account and give the crew a low Delta-V figure for entering into the EMS so that if it is called upon to shut down the engine it will do so early enough for the tail-off thrust to effect the correct total Delta-V.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Sextant star:</b> Star number 26, Spica, should be visible through the sextant when its shaft and trunnion are set to the values 73.4° and 15.1° respectively.</p>
      <p class="ed">[As CapCom Gordon Fullerton was reading up the PAD, the communication route was transferred to a ship in the Atlantic, USNS Vanguard. The changeover has caused Charlie to miss some of the information.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>001 36 12 Fullerton:</b> Charlie, this is Houston. How do you read now?</p>
      <p class="ed">[The communications link has transferred to the Vanguard...]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>001 36 15 Duke</b>: Okay, 5/5 Gordy. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="ed">[Carrying on with the PAD.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>001 36 18 Fullerton:</b> Okay, shaft was 073.4, trunnion, 15.1; boresight star 037, up 25.7, right 2.9; minus 21.31, minus 165.00; 1093.2, 34867; and 0.05g time is 023:08:28. Sirius and Rigel; 317, 108, 005. No ullage. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="ed">[The Boresight star is number 37, Nunki or Sigma Sagittarius, which should be visible through the sextant when its shaft and trunnion are set to the values 25.7&deg; and 2.9&deg; respectively.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="ed">The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is &quot;Entry Interface,&quot; defined as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. In this context, a more important milestone is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05 g.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 21.31&deg; south, 165.00&deg; west; in the mid-Pacific.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Range to go at the 0.05 g event:</b> 1,093.2 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Expected velocity at the 0.05 g event:</b> 34,867 fps. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Predicted GET of 0.05 g event:</b> Expected at 23 hours, 08 minutes and 28 seconds GET.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>GDC Align stars:</b> Stars Sirius (in Canis Major) and Rigel (in Orion) are to be used to align the gyro assemblies if it is not possible to use the guidance platform for this purpose. The align angles are 317&deg;, 108&deg;, 005&deg;.</p>
      <p class="ed">The spacecraft has two independent systems for determining attitude and change in attitude. The primary system is the <a href="acron.html#imu">IMU</a> and its freely stable platform. A secondary system, usually tied to the <a href="acron.html#scs">SCS</a>, comprises a set of gyros attached to the spacecraft structure. Unlike the IMU, which measures absolute attitude, these gyro assemblies measure the rate of attitude change. If need be, absolute attitude can be derived from these but this measurement is imprecise so at regular times, the crew presses the GDC Align button to make the GDCs (Gyro Display Couplers) knowledge of attitude match the IMU. In case the IMU is not working, the crew have a backup method of aligning the GDCs by sighting two stars through the scanning telescope in a particular way. They know what the spacecraft's attitude should be when this is achieved and can dial this into the GDCs, properly aligning them. </p>
      <p class="ed">The final note in the PAD concerns the ullage burn. Since the SPS propellant tanks are full, there is no need to perform a small RCS burn, known as the ullage burn, to settle their contents.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[To confirm the figures, Charlie Duke reads back the PAD.]</p>

      <p class="ed">[The Lift-off + 8 PAD carries data for P37, a program in the computer that will calculate the details of a burn that will return the crew to Earth. An important condition for P37 is that the spacecraft must still be in Earth's sphere of influence, thus simplifying the calculations. The program takes the four values from the PAD; the specified time for ignition of the engine, a specified maximum change in velocity (or Delta-V), the longitude of the splashdown and the GET for the start of re-entry.

This allows controllers to move complete sequences of events relative to the overall mission time. The restart sequence for the S-IVB's single J-2 engine is tied to Time Base 6 (TB-6). When TB-6 begins, all subsequent events to restart the engine such as tank repressurisation, engine chilldown, ullage, etc., follow on, leading to the engine start command 9 minutes, 30 seconds later, and ignition 8 seconds after that.]</p>

At 9 minutes to ignition, John will start the event timer counting up, having previously set it to 51:00.

Items in the checklist are therefore shown with times from 51:00, through (1:)00:00 and upwards.]</p>

      <p class="ed">[The term "ullage" comes from the brewing industry, where it means the space above the beer in a brewer's vat., but in this context it means the volume in the spacecraft propellant tanks that is filled with helium gas. In a spacecraft, fuel will float freely in the tanks, unless it is constrained. However, it is essential that there are no bubbles of helium in the propellant before it is fed into the engines. In smaller tanks, such as those of the RCS, Teflon bladders are used to control the fuel and to separate it from the helium used to pressurise the tanks. But in larger tanks, such as the four main ones of the SPS, bladders cannot be used and so a short period of acceleration is required to force the fuel to the bottom of the tank (and the helium to the top) before the SPS fires. This acceleration is provided by the RCS firing for a few seconds. Normally, the SPS will command this automatically, but in event of a failure of the automatic system, the Direct Ullage switch on Panel 1 of the MDC provides a back-up capability for initiating the RCS ullage burn. The Direct Ullage Switch is backed up by two circuit breakers on Panel 8, which must be energised to enable the switch to work. A complex system, but necessary to provide the necessary safety.]</p>

This provides a very reliable and low-weight means of achieving events such as separating the LM from the S-IVB, or of separating the docking ring from the CM to jettison the LM after docking in lunar orbit. As a down-side, they are one-shot devices that cannot be re-set if operated in error. With the SECS Pyro Arm circuit breakers live, all the relevant switches are also live. John Young is making sure that all the crew are aware of this, since even though the switches are guarded, it would be all too easy to press the wrong one and, for example, jettison the docking ring while leaving the LM attached to the S-IVB - thus losing any chance of a lunar landing. The two controls, although not adjacent, are on the same row of six switches. The even more important switches that jettison the SM from the CM are powered by different circuit breakers and are not live at this point.]</p>

      <p class="ed">[Mission Control cannot directly observe the vibration levels that the crew are sensing.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[During the 1972 Technical Debrief, the crew discussed the vibration. </p>
      <p class="ed2">Mattingly: "On TLI, it seemed to be increasing in amplitude; although I thought that the frequency was still the same."</p>
      <p class="ed2">Young: "Yes. That's what I thought all the way to ECO (Engine Cut-Off) . But, there was a buzz on the S-IVB all the way to engine cut-off. And, it was a high frequency buzz....It was too high a frequency to be characterized as pogo. The amplitude was so low you couldn't characterize it as pogo either. It didn't seem that anything was in danger of coming apart. I was more worried about it quitting."]</p>
      <p class="ed">[According to the AS-511 Flight Evaluation Report, "In a post-mission debriefing the Apollo 16 crew reported that the vehicle had experienced some low amplitude vibration or “buzz” during portions of the S-II stage burn, and throughout the S-IVB first and second burns. The crew also noted that the vibrations did not appear to be oriented in any particular axis. Analysis of flight data indicates the presence of low amplitude, approximately 65 hertz, vibration during the S-II stage burn and both S-IVB stage burns. The data show lateral amplitudes of ±0.10 g at the IU during S-IVB first burn and ±0.20 during second burn. The vibrations can also be seen on selected propulsion pressure measurements. A review of AS-510 [Apollo 15] data shows similar vibration at approximately 72 hertz. Because of the data characteristics, the vibration is suspected to be related to normal stage propulsion system operation and probably characteristic of the J-2 turbomachinery. These vibrations pose no pogo or any other structural concerns, and are of such low amplitude as to be virtually obscured in the measurement background noise."

The lighter vehicle mass was due, in part, to a slightly longer (0.4 seconds) than anticipated first S-IVB burn, due in turn to lower than anticipated S-IC and S-II performance.]</p>
