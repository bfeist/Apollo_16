      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. We've now had loss of signal with Apollo 16. We'll be reacquiring the spacecraft in about 45 minutes. With a good maneuver we would expect that acquisition time to be 79 hours, 10 minutes, 25 seconds. Without the burn we would be reacquiring about three and a half minutes prior to that, or at 79 hours, 6 minutes, 46 seconds. As Apollo 16 went around the corner of the Moon everything looked good for the maneuver. The spacecraft was in an orbit of 169.4 by 58.1 nautical miles [313.7 by 107.6 kilometres] and the last velocity reading we got was 5,368 feet [1,636 metres] per second. We're now about nine minutes, 17 seconds away from the scheduled time that the crew will be performing Descent Orbit Insertion. At 78 hours, 25 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 79 hours, 6 minutes. We're about four and a half minutes away from the expected time of reacquiring Apollo 16 on its third revolution of the Moon. At which time they should have lowered their orbit to about 10 by 58 nautical miles [19 by 107 kilometres]. If, however, for some reason they did not perform that maneuver we would be reacquiring in about 30 seconds. The Service Propulsion engine on this particular spacecraft is consuming about 66 pounds of propellant per second of burn; based on that when next we see Apollo 16 they should be about 1,600 pounds [726 kilogrammes] lighter and traveling about 1,136 miles an hour slower [sic - correctly quoted as 136 miles(251 kilometres) per hour earlier]. The Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver which was targeted to occur at the Ground Elapsed Time of 78 hours, 33 minutes, 44 seconds was to have been a 24.2 second burn of the Service Propulsion System engine, and this would produce a total velocity change of 210.3 feet per second [64.1 metres per second], most of which would be retrograde, giving us the desired orbit of 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 kilometres]. And we've passed the time of acquisition had they not performed the burn.&nbsp; All continues to be quiet. We're now three minutes away from the expected time of acquisition with a good Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo control. We should be coming up on acquisition of signal now. And network reports that we have AOS.</p> <a name="079_10_37"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 37 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. Nominal burn; first - first DOI burn we ever had that was nominal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 44 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That's great news.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 51 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we'll stand by for your burn report.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 56 Duke:</b> Okay, Henry. It feels like if we had - we're clipping the tops of the trees all through there - what it looks like.

      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 42 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, 16. Unbalanced?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 48 Duke:</b> Okay, it jumped up to 200 increase.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 53 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 56 Duke:</b> It never really stabilized though, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 59 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 12 10 Young:</b> And a Verb 82, last look, thought we were at 10.9 [nautical miles - 20.1 kilometres] perigee.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 12 15 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy 10.9.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 12 24 Young:</b> But I don't think it really knows. But the MSFN really knows.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> That last comment was from John Young. Earlier we heard from Charlie Duke reporting a nearly perfect Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. Young reported that they're on board. Readings show that they had an apolune of - rather a perilune of 10.9 nautical miles. The targeted was 10.3, but again that's an onboard reading and we'll be tracking and getting a reading here on the ground.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 13 29 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. it appeared to us that we got an auto shutdown.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 13 34 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Charlie. Copy auto shutdown.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 15 10 Young:</b> You got any preliminary data, Houston?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 15 14 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, John. The doppler says stay; we're waiting on the short arc.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 15 20 Young:</b> Okay; thank you.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> John Young's question is in reference to Stay/No-Stay - that we'll be passing up from the Control Center here in the event that tracking data -- we've got about two minutes of it on which the Flight Dynamics Officer will make his calculations - in the event tracking data showed that we did not get the desired orbit and we're in an unsafe orbit, the crew has a maneuver on board that they would perform to raise their orbit to a satisfactory level. This is a so-called bailout burn which would be performed at 79 hours, 22 minutes, 8 seconds or about six minutes from now. All indications, preliminary, are that everything is good. Assuming that maneuver when as planned, and the orbit is as we would expect, Apollo 16 should be at an altitude of about 19 nautical miles [35 kilometres] above the lunar surface, accounting for Charlie Duke's earlier comment that it appeared to be right down among the tree tops.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 17 42 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. You're good on the short arc. You have a stay, and we show you 59 by 10.7.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 17 53 Young:</b> Roger; 59 by 10.7. Thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 19 13 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Can you - could you give us Auto on the High Gain?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 19 21 Young:</b> Roger. You have it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 04 Mattingly:</b> Henry, if you remember that little real bright crater on the northern rim of Chaplygin that Stu and Farouk were talking about the other day, we - we happened to see it right up close to us as we came by on this orbit, and we got a couple of pics for you on it, and that really is an unusual little guy. And it's really beautiful.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 35 Mattingly:</b> Probably getting carried away with all of this, but we've - we've got all kinds of things to see back there. It would really be nice to fly that kind of an orbit down low.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 44 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 49 Mattingly:</b> And, we're pitching down to our landmark track attitude, and this is my first chance to point the sextant at the surface, and the sextant is just as clear as a bell. It's beautiful. You can pick out little bitty features. They're just -they're just as clear. There's no fuzziness. And the telescope's the same way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 21 08 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that's great: We ought to be able to get some good use out of that.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. The landmark tracking Ken Mattingly is referring to is a procedure used on board the spacecraft to determine their orbit. It's also a procedure that will be used by Mattingly from lunar orbit to track the spacecraft on the surface of the Moon, hopefully, and allow scientist on the ground to compute a precise location for the landing site for the touchdown part of the Lunar Module. We now show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 13.8 nautical miles [25.6 kilometres], continuing to drop down towards Pericynthion. And the preliminary tracking data, the flight dynamics officer reported, shows an orbit of 59 by 10.7 [nautical miles 109 by 19.8 kilometres]. We expect that that orbit will be refined somewhat as we get additional tracking that's based on the first look of the tracking data, but is very close to the desired orbit of 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 kilometres].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 23 11 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Omni Delta.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 26 17 Duke:</b> Hank, out to the - my side, out Window 5, there was one crater here that you could see in one section of it, it looked like some outcrop two-thirds the way up the crater wall, and some big blocks had rolled down the - into the crater floor, and you could see the boulder tracks all the way down.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 26 37 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy. Can you locate that one?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 26 42 Duke:</b> Wait a minute. No, I'm pretty lost right now. Let me see if I can figure it out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 27 11 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, while you're maneuvering there, we'd like to ask what value did you put in your EMS, and what did you get on your EMS check?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 28 28 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. That crater I had, I think was in a series around Maclaurin, maybe a little bit further west than that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 28 41 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 29 40 Duke:</b> Hank, coming across the mare here, it reminds you of [garble] static system cals at Edwards.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 29 49 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. You're really down low, screaming across, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 30 24 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Did you copy the question I had about the EMS Delta-V?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 21 Duke:</b> Houston, the Goclenius Rille looks like large grabens with very subdued sides to them; no outcrop at all apparent from my position.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 36 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 47 Duke:</b> And looking on up into the Gutenberg Rilles you can see it cross - one crater just climbs right across the crater wall.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 57 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 00 Duke:</b> And that's Gutenberg Sea. That's Gutenberg Sea, Hank, and you can see the wall is down,dropped into the rille.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 15 Duke:</b> I'm reading you five by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 19 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. A littler earlier, I asked a question about the EMS Delta-V. Did you copy that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 25 Duke:</b> Negative; we did not.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 27 Hartsfield:</b> Okay ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 28 Duke:</b> It - it read minus 2.3.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We had a question here as to how the EMS Delta-V check came out, and which value you loaded into the Delta-V counter?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 41 Duke:</b> Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 44 Mattingly:</b> Can I call you in a second on that, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 45 Hartsfield:</b> Sure thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 47 Mattingly:</b> It was like - it was like 1.8 at shutdown because of the drift in the EMS, and I did a check, and it came out to be normal and the bias was the same. I put in the Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, the same thing that we've used before, but then it looked to me like the bias was in - less than half a foot per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 06 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy. We were a little confused here because the - the value that you had at the end there was somewhere in between what we thought it ought to be, depending on which setting you put in the Delta-V counter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 19 Mattingly:</b> Roger. It was about 1.6 or something like that at shutdown. I'll have to look back at the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 30 Duke:</b> Okay, Houston. The walls - the north wall of Capella has striations that are dipping eastward about 60 degrees or so, all the way across the north face.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 46 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 51 Duke:</b> Okay, and also Isidorus, the same thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 34 14 Hartsfield:</b> J-2 should be on the horizon now, Ken.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 36 09 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, you're coming up on about 30 seconds to TCA.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 47 58 Mattingly:</b> Hark, would you check on one thing for me? Would you find out if this method I've been using for reading out the maneuver times, Verb 4 Noun 1, is in any way affected by or affects the use of Program 509?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 14 Hartsfield:</b> Will do, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 18 Mattingly:</b> Thank you, sir. And I got a couple of minutes here, if you would like to go over some of those questions you had before now. I - I wasn't paying much attention.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 33 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken. I think they got your answer awhile ago and it satisfied them, but I'll make sure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I wasn't paying a lot of attention; I was trying to pick up that landmark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 46 Hartsfield:</b> Do you have any comments on the landmark tracking? Did it all go smoothly?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 52 Mattingly:</b> Well, except for the fact that those optics are perfect, that's really neat. The target area did not look as I anticipated. It's a - I think it's a function of the low Sun angle, but it looked to me like there were far more rims around the craters than - than what - the impression I had from looking at things on the - on the models. And I did not pick up North or South Ray; they still were in the shadows. So, I guess it's possible that I could have been on the wrong crater, but it sure looked like to me like I must have been on Gator.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 49 30 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 49 32 Mattingly:</b> It's still - still a problem in scaling when you look at something like that, until you're sure that you have the right feel for it. But I think it's pretty obvious, and I think picking it up tomorrow will be relatively easy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 50 45 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Could you bring up the High Gain, Pitch plus 35, Yaw 290.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 02 Mattingly:</b> Say again your Yaw number.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 03 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; 290.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 44 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. They say there is no problem in calculating maneuver completion time, and - and it does not interfere with 509.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay, thank you. I've been avoiding using that. All right. We're about ready to go through our solar monitor and tiedown release. You folks ready for us to do that?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 11 Mattingly:</b> Hank, another piece of questionable data that've collected today is - well, on our low pass on the back side there, we got our color wheel out. And we have two votes for Number 17, and one vote for Number 13.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 28 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 30 Mattingly:</b> And that's over on the back side just past Chaplygin. And Number 17 really isn't quite right; it's just the closest thing we have. And the same comment applies to Number 13.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 41 Young:</b> Well, I still say 13 was right on.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>080 09 21 Mattingly:</b> Outstanding.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 80 hours, 12 minutes. The Guidance and Control Officer reports that from looking at the replay of data from that Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver performed at the end of the second revolution, he reports that the engine appeared to perform normally in every respect and we're currently showing Apollo 16 in an orbit 58.6 nautical miles by 9.9 [108.5 by 18.3 kilometres] and we expect that will continue to be refined somewhat. Ken Mattingly has completed a series of exercises that deploy certain of the experiments in the Service Module Scientific Instrument Module Bay, the SIM Bay experiments, the Gamma Ray and Gamma Ray Spectrometer and Mass Spectrometer on 25 foot [7.6 metre] and 24 foot [7.3 metre] booms respectively were extended to their full out positions and then retracted, to checked the operation. Mattingly then extended the Mass Spectrometer to about a third of it's length and turned it on. It's about 8.4 feet [2.6 metres] out from the side of the Service Module now on it's retractable boom. And also turned on the Laser Altimeter. The Mass Spectrometer is designed to gather information on the nature and composition of the lunar atmosphere; also to detect contaminants in that atmosphere. Such things as the volatile products...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>080 14 12 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>080 14 18 Duke:</b> All righty. See you in a little while.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>080 14 21 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Over.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> The Mass Spectrometer detects such things as tile volatile products given off by volcanoes, should any of those happen to be active around this time, we also detect water vapor should that exist in the lunar atmosphere. The other experiment activated by Mattingly was the Laser Altimeter. You heard him ask how that was performing. A report from the Orbital Science Officer here was that it appeared to be functioning normally. This device measures the spacecraft altitude above the lunar surface and is correlated with Panoramic Camera photographs obtained of the lunar surface. Putting these two bits of information together - the photo and the laser altimeter data - it's possible to determine within about 6 feet [1.8 metres] the elevation of lunar surface features. We are now about 45 seconds from loosing radio contact with Apollo 16 as the spacecraft passes behind the Moon on its third revolution. We'll be reacquiring - reestablishing radio contact at the beginning of the fourth revolution in about 45 minutes.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 81 hours, four minutes. We're standing by now to regain radio contact with Apollo 16 now in it's fourth revolution of the Moon. This will be the last front side pass prior to the time the crew begins their scheduled nine hour rest period. And should be a relatively quiet period. And the Flight Dynamics Officer has just reported the - that their latest tracking shows the spacecraft to be in an orbit of 58.6 by 10.6 nautical miles [108.5 by 19.6 kilometres] as a result of that Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. We're about ten seconds now from regaining radio contact. We've had Acquisition Of Signal.</p> <a name="081_06_01"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 06 01 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 22 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 29 Young:</b> You're five by, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 31 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Our data down here we worked on during the back side shows you're in 58.8 by 10.6.</p> <a name="081_07_46"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 46 Young:</b> Okay. And while - while we were on the back side, we had a couple of Main B Undervolt lights.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. You want to tell us about it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 08 03 Young:</b> Stand by. Yeah, it was when Ken was - messing around with the SIM bay, and he'll fill you in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 08 11 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 08 14 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, we got a little behind on this sequence already, Hank. But as soon as I turned the - had the Mapping on and it worked fine, I turned the Pan Camera on, and as soon as I went to Operate on the Pan Camera, we got a Main B Undervolt. So I turned it back to Standby and left it there. Charlie said he saw about 25 volts on Main B, and concluded I'd wait and let you take a look at it. And then we got another Main B Undervolt at some five minutes or so later, and it again was momentary. By the time we looked at it, it all looked pretty normal. The only - We checked the fuel cell regulator pressures. They looked good, and I really don't have any idea what might of caused it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 09 02 Hartsfield:</b> Yeah. All the things we could check look okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 09 06 Duke:</b> Hank, we got a - it might not even be a small anomaly, but Fuel Cell 3, the H<sub>2</sub> flow's running a little bit higher than the O<sub>2</sub> flow, but the regulator pressure looks fine to me. But the other two fuel cells, H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, match.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 09 24 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 13 Young:</b> My guess is when you dump the DSE the whole story will be right on there probably.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 17 Hartsfield:</b> Okay [garble]. John.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 23 Young:</b> When you get the DSE translated, probably tell you what happened.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 25 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 07 Mattingly:</b> Hank, you really can see both the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray booms deployed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Understand you can see them both.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 14 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. Looks like a couple of feet of the boom is about all you can see.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 28 Hartsfield:</b> You've really got us puzzled with this undervolt now, because the Pan Camera runs off from Main A.,</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 44 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, we'd noticed the same thing. It - you know it may not be rational, but it just seemed like that was the - I touched one switch and got a Main Undervolt so I took it back off again. Decided to even let you think about it before I [garble] anymore.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 52 Duke:</b> Possible that it doesn't have any connection.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 53 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 09 Mattingly:</b> I still have the power on it, Hank. I've got it in Standby and Power on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 15 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. And, Ken, I'd like to verify - is your- Nonessential Bus on Main A or Main B?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 28 Mattingly:</b> That's Main A.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 30 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 03 Duke:</b> And, Hank, last night we - I - think we got verification that we could wear the LCGs to bed tonight and be all ready to go by in the morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 14 Hartsfield:</b> That is affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 20 Duke:</b> Okay. Anybody thought any more about my suit?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 26 Hartsfield:</b> We thought about it, and smoked it over, and we kind of think maybe we ought to do nothing unless you have some real bad trouble tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 39 Duke:</b> Like if we can't get it zipped.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 14 07 Young:</b> Okay. Can we use my pliers on it to pull the zipper closed?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 14 53 Young:</b> Houston. Houston, 16. Do you read? Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 14 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Reading you 5 by 5, John. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 15 03 Young:</b> Okay. If I have trouble closing it, can I use my pliers to get a better grip on it to pull it closed? Because it took me the better part of 20 minutes the other day to do it, and it usually takes about two. There's a place on there in the small of Charlie's back where that thing has just separated too far apart on the restraint zipper for me to pull it closed easily. When he gets on the LCG, the FCS, and the UCD bulk in there, the suit is going to be farther apart than it was - yesterday.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 16 03 Hartsfield:</b> John, we talked to Dave about that, and he said the big problem is that you can't arch your back in zero g as well. He had - he had a lot of trouble too, but on the Moon in one-sixth g he had no problem at all, because the gravity helped him arch his back. Does that sound like the problem - you just couldn't get arched back that far enough to do it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 16 30 Young:</b> Got me there. It looked like he was arched as much as he usually is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 16 46 Young:</b> But you're saying that if I can't do it in - in zero g, we go on down to the Moon and try it in one-sixth g?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 17 00 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That sounds pretty good, John. We - we did look at a backup procedure here, but it's a long - looks like a long thing and involves using a needle and pulling things together like you're sewing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 17 43 Duke:</b> Okay, Hank. I think to give us every benefit of the doubt that I will not - I don't plan to wear the - the FCS probably tomorrow, and I'll just use the LCG and UCD.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 18 07 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Understand, and could you give us Auto on - the high gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 18 16 Duke:</b> There you go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 19 28 Duke:</b> Hank, also we would like to get permission to fill the drink bags tonight to save a few minutes also, if you think that's gonna be all right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 19 43 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That - Go ahead and do that, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 19 48 Duke:</b> All right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 20 31 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, we can't find any connection between the Pan Camera and Main Bus A, and we were wondering - Main Bus B, and we were wondering if, when you got the second momentary one - undervolt - were you moving any switches at that time?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 20 49 Mattingly:</b> That's negative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 13 Mattingly:</b> They were both momentary Main Bus undervolts.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 24 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. The - the first one was momentary also?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 31 Mattingly:</b> It - it could be, or it could be that the sensor is triggering at the wrong level. It could be that the sensor shifted up to something that looks reasonable. I wouldn't object - we still got the Pan Camera power on - I wouldn't object to [garble] it to operate for a second and back off - go ahead and use a couple of frames just to let you watch it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 54 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 29 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 30 Hartsfield:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 34 Duke:</b> Is Tom satisfied with his Glycol Evap Out? We've got off scale, high here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 59 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by. Stand by a minute, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 24 21 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. You're [garble] is at the top of the scale. You're still okay. You should now monitor Rad Out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 24 32 Duke:</b> A Rad Out is 75.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 24 36 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p> <a name="081_28_17"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 28 17 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Talked with the suit people, and they don't want you using the pliers on the zippers.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 28 31 Young:</b> I just used it to get a better grip with, not to pull the zipper, just to pull with.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 28 54 Hartsfield:</b> Their concern is over side load, John. They're afraid for you to use the pliers.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 06 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 34 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, Houston. We would like to talk to you a minute about this docking latch, if you're free.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 45 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p> <a name="081_29_48"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 48 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We've got a real long procedure here. I don't think you need to copy it all down. Let me just read it through to you once, and kind of let me discuss it as we go. What we want to do is kind of get a look at the thing tomorrow and see what the condition of it is. After you disconnect the LM umbilical, we want - would like for you to open the orange LM umbilical connector cover and inspect the roller pawl. The roller pawl, we hope, is engaged in the detent, but we would like to find out if it's in the detent, or is it free, or sticking up, and you can do that by looking in the side of the latch after you remove that umbilical connector cover. Is there any question on that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 38 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. I'm not sure I know what you're looking for.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 42 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, when you look in the side there ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 45 Mattingly:</b> ...I'm not at all sure what the roller pawl is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 46 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, the roller pawl is on the far left side of the latch, behind and above the Auxiliary Release Button. And it can be identified by the roller on the tip of the pawl. The pawl is just a little arm that sticks out, and it's got a little roller on the end of it that rides on the cam that has these detents in it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 08 Mattingly:</b> Do you want to do this before we unlock it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 12 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And it best be done tomorrow - before you get your helmet and gloves on, of course. Just take a look at it while - perhaps while they're bringing the LM up. And if you find after we get the condition of that, if the roller is down in the detent like we suspect that it is, when you remove the yellow probe umbilical cover on the right side of the latch, we would like you to look in the right side in there and at the bungee bell crank mechanism, and see if there's any foreign-object damage or anything wedged up in there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 51 Mattingly:</b> When you say remove the cover - do you mean physically remove it from the spacecraft, or just open it up and look underneath it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 57 Hartsfield:</b> Just open it up and look under there, Ken. And this is mainly - these two steps is just an inspection. We'd just like to verify the condition of the roller pawl and also the bell crank mechanism on the other side. Has nothing to do with the latch, but at least it'll give us an idea of what's wrong inside, if there is anything. It's not gonna help you in any way to prepare for unlocking it. To unlock it - after you've looked at these two things, we would like to know if the latch handle requires force to cock the latch on the first stroke - and the second stroke, if required. In other words, if the handle comes away real easy, as you recall, then the thing is already cocked. More than likely, it is gonna take some force, and we would like to verify how this works. And if it should require force, pull it down, and then we want to see that the hook comes out there inboard approximately 16 degrees. If the hook doesn't come out, then all you got to do is pull down on the handle to the full cock position, and hold it, and then just reach up and grab the hook, and pull it inboard about 16 degrees, and the hook should stay there. And then you just proceed with normal undocking.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 33 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay. So the kind of thing you want me to look for are information only. Is that affirmative?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 33 27 Hartsfield:</b> Right. It would help the guys down here to try to understand what - what really happened to the latch. We kind of suspect it only got one cock. But if you look in there, and look for the roller pawl on the left side and look at the bell crank on the right side, at least that would tell us that nothing is jamming it, and that the roller pawl is in the right direction - right place. Operationally though, prepare for undocking. What it really amounts to, you just use the normal procedure. You pull the latch handle down and cock it if necessary, and if the hook doesn't come back, just hold the latch handle all the way down to the full cock position and pull the hook back.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 34 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I just wanted to keep in mind what it was I needed if the time gets crowded.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 34 26 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. The only this is - if there is any question on cocking, the only thing you have to do there is just pull it down and get the hook out of the way. Do you have any questions on any of that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 34 48 Mattingly:</b> Ah, Hank, we just [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 34 54 Mattingly:</b> Not - not right now. Maybe you want to get in there and look at it. I'll call and ask you for some clarification or something tomorrow. But I think I know what you mean.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 35 01 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 35 12 Duke:</b> Hank, as we came up towards the landing site, in that terrain - the general terrain to the east of us appears to me to be frothy vesicular-looking type terrain, real [garble] looking at this scale. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 35 33 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 35 38 Duke:</b> I'd say that was the Descartes. It has that appearance to it to me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 35 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 35 51 Duke:</b> And do you have this LM DAP load for us and TEI?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 35 57 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We're working on those PADs now.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>081 53 06 Hartsfield:</b> Well, we had this - starting this thing 20 minutes early before so that we could help you prior to LOS and we're convinced that you don't really need Tape that much time, and what we think you ought to do is get the gimbal drive test started - you know, the Main Buses on about eight minutes early rather than six minutes.

      <p class="tech"><b>081 53 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Do I dare use my ink pen this time?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 53 45 Hartsfield:</b> I hope it's good for the rest of the burns now, if we change that to 52 minutes and minus eight minutes.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>081 54 15 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, now, earlier we had deleted that "Tape Recorder, High Bit Rate" line there and added it back on the back page, and I guess now we need to move it back.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 54 35 Mattingly:</b> Okay, would you settle for minus eight, so I can just leave it where it is?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 54 39 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; that's good enough. Just do it there and delete it from the back - back side of the card.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 54 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we'll do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 55 31 Mattingly:</b> Hank, are we going to end up with temperatures that are low enough, or would you like for me to manually set this Temp In valve to a little lower temperature?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 55 44 Hartsfield:</b> Are you talking about the Oxidizer pressure, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 55 50 Mattingly:</b> No, sir; the manual Temp In and the glycol loop.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 55 53 Hartsfield:</b> Oh, that - EECOM advises that looks pretty good now.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>081 57 06 Mattingly:</b> Hank, I guess I'd - I would like to run it cooler to get the cockpit a little cooler, if that isn't going to cause any other problems.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>081 59 20 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Ken. And did you happen to notice the retract time on the Mapping Camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 59 27 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. I meant to get that in. That was - I thought it was excessive. In fact, I thought it had maybe stuck. It was about three minutes.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>082 04 01 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. To more evenly distribute the - the electrical loads when you get on the back side after LOS, we'd like you to take Telcom Group 2 to AC1.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>082 04 22 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; that's after LOS. And in regard to the Mixing Valve, you can adjust that for an Evap Out temperature of 49 degrees, and you ought to be okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>082 04 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay, is that 49 degrees the coldest temperature? Or just how did you -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>082 04 46 Hartsfield:</b> If you adjust it right now to an Evap Out of 49 ...</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>082 07 15 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. They're admonishing me to tell you to be sure you follow the checklist on setting up the comm presleep.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>082 07 27 Mattingly:</b> Roger. We'll do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>082 08 24 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS.</p> <a name="082_10"></a>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. We've lost radio contact now with the spacecraft as it passes behind the Moon on the fourth revolution. The crew is scheduled to begin a nine hour rest period while on the backside of the Moon, and we would expect to hear no further word from them until the end of that rest period. During this frontside pass on the fourth revolution, there were three major items covered. I'll try to run through those three, and summarize what to us appeared to be the major points. On first reacquiring contact, John Young reported that they had seen two Main Bus B undervolt conditions - as he described it these were transitory events Main Bus B voltage dropping briefly to the point to where it triggered a Master Caution and Warning alarm. Normally, Main Bus B, which is one of two Main Buses supplying electrical power to the equipment aboard the Command and Service Module, operates at about 27 to 28 volts under load. The Master Caution and Warning is set to trigger at 26.25 volts, if the voltage drops to that level. And in replaying the data tapes, we saw the voltage drop to about 26.14 volts. The data tape replay, however, showed no indication of a problem with any of the electrical equipment. One sometimes suspects momentary current overloads -- a heavy drain of current which would then drag the voltage down, but there was no indication that any of the equipment was malfunctioning. The one thing the crew described that appeared to be coincident with the.voltage drop, was the operation of the Pan Camera. However, simultaneous data on this camera, when it was operating, showed that the camera was functioning normally. At this point after looking at all of the data, and considering the loads on both Main Bus A and Main Bus B, one supposition is that we had a coincident series of events, which momentarily overloaded Main Bus B. Such things as heaters coming on simultaneously at the same time we had a heavy current drain for the SIM bay activities. If this is, in fact, the case, it can easily be remedied by transferring some of the load to Main Bus A - a simple re-configuration. And that appears to be the most likely cause of the Main Bus undervoltages, in which case we would have no particular problem. One other thing that was discussed, was the suit problem. Going back to the beginning of this one - Charlie Duke reported last night on entering the Lunar Module suited - getting suited up and getting into the Lunar Module that John Young [sic - it was actually Charlie Duke himself that had experienced the problems] had some difficulty getting the suit zipped. The restraint zipper closed across the back of the suit - this zipper does not maintain the pressure of the suit, but is a load carrying zipper that holds all the layers together on the outside of the pressure layers. And Duke mentioned in order to minimize the problem of getting the suit zipped tomorrow, he would like to leave off the Fecal Containment System. In zipping the suit up the first time both the Fecal Containment System and the Liquid Cool[ed] Garment were not worn. Duke's feeling was that once these additional items were added underneath the suit it would increase the problem of closing that zipper. And we gave him a go ahead to leave the fecal containment system off, and recommend that he make an attempt to get the suit zipped using the normal procedures. John Young suggested the possibility of using a pair of pliers that they carry on board to assist in it, a recommendation at this time is that not be done. Dave Scott, who was by earlier in the evening, discussed with the flight controllers a similar problem that they encountered, although apparently not quite so severe, on Apollo 15. And Dave's analysis of that situation was that in zero G it's more difficult to arch one's back without gravity to help. Arching the back is a method that is used to reduce the strain across the zipper so that it is easier to get it closed, and it was suggested to Charlie that he make every effort to brace himself and get the back arched in order to make the job a little easier of getting the zipper closed. And we do have a backup procedure that'll be discussed with the crew to assist in closing that zipper. If the problem arises tomorrow when they're preparing to get into the Lunar Module and suiting up. Also CapCom Henry Hartsfield discussed a procedure with Ken Mattingly for checking out the docking latches. One of the 12 docking latches has apparently not latched down firmly onto the LM tunnel docking ring. This causes no particular concern, but there is some interest in determining why the latch did not close. Mattingly, last night, was asked to cycle a device that is connected with the latch. This gave the flight controllers an indication that the latch, which is cocked prior to docking, was not fully cocked, and therefore, did not latch fully. There is also the possibility that the latch is broken. In order to determine which of these is the case, Mattingly was given a series of procedures to follow, of which we hope will provide some information and shed some light on whether the latch simply was not fully cocked, or whether it is broken or has malfunctioned in some other way. This is primarily of concern for future flights. It doesn't have a direct bearing on this flight, it's felt that the latch will in no way effect undocking and since only three of the 12 latches are required for a firm hard docking, there is no particular concern that it will in any way effect the docking either. As mentioned previously, we expect to see the crew asleep when next we reacquire the spacecraft. That will be about 40 minutes. And as Apollo 16 went around the corner on the fourth revolution, we showed it in an orbit of 58.7 by 10.4 nautical miles [108.7 by 19.3 kilometres]. At 82 hours, 19 minutes into the flight of Apollo 16, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 83 hours, 35 minutes. We now have a little under thirty minutes of acquisition time remaining before Apollo 16 goes around the corner on the fifth revolution of the Moon and we lose radio contact. And it has remained quiet, and no calls from the crew, and relatively little activity here in the Control Center - primarily monitoring systems and preparing for tomorrow's activities. We're continuing to watch the Spacecraft orbit change gradually. We're now showing an apogee of 58.8 nautical miles [108.9 kilometres], and a perigee, or pericynthion more correctly, of 10.5 nautical miles [19.4 kilometres]. This crew rest period is scheduled to last for about nine hours. And the crew is to be awakened at about 91 hours, 30 minutes - about eight hours from now.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 84 hours, 3 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 16. And nearing the end of the fifth revolution around the Moon. Now we have about one minute, 45 seconds before we lose radio contact with the spacecraft. We've heard nothing from the crew. They're in their rest period. And all spacecraft systems appear to be functioning properly at the present time. We show Apollo 16 in an orbit 10.4 nautical miles by 58.8 [19.3 by 108.9 kilometres]. And at this time in Mission Control we're in a mist of a shift handover. Flight Director Gene Kranz and his team of flight controllers coming on to replace the Pete Frank team. Spacecraft communicator on the up coming shift will be astronaut Donald Peterson. And we do plan to have a change of shift briefing. We expect that that will start in about 15 minutes. The briefing will be in the MSC News Center Briefing room. At 84 hours, 4 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 84 hours 52 minutes into the Mission. We're a little more than 20 seconds away from scheduled time of acquisition of Apollo 16. Now on its sixth revolution around the Moon. We presently show an orbit of 58.8 nautical miles [108.9 kilometres] by 10.6 nautical miles [19.6 kilometres], meanwhile in the Mission Control center, we have had a shift changeover of flight control teams. The White Team of flight controllers headed by flight director Gene Kranz is now aboard. The surgeon reports that he has two of the crew members on his biomed, he reported that Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke went to sleep rather rapidly, whereas Command Module pilot Ken Mattingly was still awake at loss of signal. The crew of Apollo 16 is now in their rest period, however, we'll leave the line up on this front side pass in the event that we do have conversation with the crew of Apollo 16. Our CapCom on this shift is astronaut Don Peterson. We have acquired data from Apollo 16 and we'll continue to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston at 84 hours, 54 minutes Ground Elapsed Time.</p>

We have some 40 minutes remaining on this front side pass for Apollo 16. Now on its sixth revolution around the Moon. We've had no communication with the crew, presently in their rest period, however, we will continue to leave the line up during this front side pass. We show Apollo 16 traveling at a velocity of 5,546 feet [1,690 metres] per second. Current altitude, 11 nautical miles [20.3 kilometres], the spacecraft is presently in an orbit of 58.8 nautical miles [108.9 kilometres] by 10.5 nautical miles [19.4 kilometres]. Spacecraft weight in orbit at this time 76,109 pounds [34,522 kilogrammes]. At 85 hours, 20 minutes, continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 85 hours and 59 minutes Ground Elapsed Time.

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 86 hours, 46 minutes into the mission and we're coming up now on acquisition with Apollo 16 now on its seventh revolution around the Moon. Apollo 16 is presently in an orbit of 58.9 nautical miles [109.1 kilometres] by 10.6 nautical miles [19.6 kilometres]. We expect no conversation with the crew on this front side pass. Young, Duke, Mattingly now well into their rest period. We will leave the line down on this front side pass but we'll bring it up should any conversation developed. We do now have acquisition with Apollo 16 and are receiving data. At 86 hours, 47 minutes Ground Elapsed [Time], this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 87 hours, 52 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 has now passed out of acquisition range.

We show orbital parameters of 58.8 nautical miles [108.9 kilometres] and 10.4 nautical miles [19.3 kilometres]. We had no conversation with the crew of Apollo 16 during this front side pass. The crew is presently in a rest period. We're at 87 hours, 53 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 88 hours, 40 minutes into the mission. We're standing by now awaiting acquisition with the Apollo 16 spacecraft on its eighth revolution around the Moon. We presently show an orbit of 58.9 nautical miles [109.1 kilometres] by 10.6 nautical miles [19.6 kilometres]. The flight surgeon here in Mission Control reports that Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly and Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke were sleeping very well when he looked at their data through the last pass. We are now receiving data from Apollo 16. The spacecraft has been reacquired. We're at 88 hours, 41 minutes into the mission and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 89 hours, 46 minutes into the flight.

The Apollo 16 Spacecraft has passed out of range on its eighth revolution around the Moon. On this past frontside pass, we had no conversation with the crew, still in their rest period. Our wake-up clock here in Mission Control shows that the crew has one hour and 43 minutes of sleep time remaining before the wake-up call. We're at 89 hours and 47 minutes, and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 90 hours, 34 minutes into the mission. We now show Apollo 16 in an orbit of 58.9 nautical miles [109.1 kilometres] by 10.5 nautical miles [19.4 kilometres]. We're coming up on acquisition of the spacecraft on this the ninth revolution. Because we will wake up the crew at some point on this front side pass. We will leave the line up alive and at 90 hours, 35 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston. We' re acquiring data now.</p>
