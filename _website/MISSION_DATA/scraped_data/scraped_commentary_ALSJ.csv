||alsj|At 74 hours 28 minutes 28 seconds in the mission of Apollo 16, the crew fired the Command and Service Module (CSM)'s Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine to put themselves into a 170 by 58 nautical mile elliptical orbit around the Moon.  The low point of this orbit was over the Lunar Farside at the point at which they had entered lunar orbit; the high point was roughly over the Descartes landing site.  Four hours later, after completing two orbits of the Moon, the crew fired the SPS engine for a second time to put themselves in a new orbit, one with a high point of 58 miles and low point of just 11 miles.  In this &quot;Descent Orbit&quot;, the high point was over the lunar Farside, still roughly at the point at which the crew had first entered lunar orbit, and the low point was east of the landing site.  From this low point on a later orbit, the LM crew would begin their descent to the lunar surface.  Note that the low-point of the Descent Orbit had been planned as 8 miles, but the difference between 8 and 11 was not deemed significant enough to warrant an additional SPS burn.
||alsj|After an eight hour rest period, the crew awakened at about 91 hours 30 minutes and, at about 93 hours, Commander John Young and Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke entered the Lunar Module Orion to begin their power-up and checkout procedures.  It was at this point that the first of three notable hardware problems were discovered.  The first two were LM problems that were resolved with relative ease.  The third was a far more serious CSM problem that ultimately resulted in a three-orbit delay of the landing.
|Duke|alsj|Before PDI (Powered Descent Initiation), I remember two major problems.  As we started powering up the LM, our high-gain antenna didn't work in one of the axes - I believe it was yaw.  And we never could shake it loose.
||alsj|Because the spacecraft attitude relative to Earth changed constantly as the LM orbited the Moon and then descended to the surface, an inability to maintain high-gain pointing would mean, among other things, that the crew would be unable to receive digital data from Earth at a high enough speed that it could be directly loaded into the LM computer.  Although the landing could be flown by using the LM's omni-directional antennas for communications and telemetry, loss of the high-gain dictated a change in procedures.
|Duke|alsj|So we had to start changing (spacecraft) attitudes and we had to start getting the stuff (meaning the computer updates) up at low bit rate, and that led to a real problem loading the computer with the ephemeris and all of that.  So we ended up having to copy a lot of that stuff (by hand).  There was pages of it, I remember.  And I just copied all of that stuff down and then had to manually put that in the computer.
||alsj|The ephemeris is a table of data concerning spacecraft motions.
|Duke|alsj|Then, as we powered up the RCS (Reaction Control System, the small steering rockets), we had a double regulator failure in one of the systems.
||alsj|The LM had four sets of four, small rocket engines used to rotate the spacecraft around three axes.  There was a set of four RCS thrusters at each corner of the LM Ascent Stage.  Because the RCS was so critical to the performance of the mission, it actually consisted of a pair of identical systems of tanks, valves, regulators, and piping.  While Duke was manually updating the computer, Young opened valves which fed high-pressure helium into the RCS propellant tanks, thereby pressurizing them.  As he did so, Young noted that the pressure in RCS System A climbed above the planned value of 184 psi and, indeed, continued to increase at approximately 10 psi/minute.  (See sections 9.6.3 and 14.2.4 of the Apollo 16 Mission Report for details.)  This observation indicated that there was a leak in the regulator assembly and, in order to reduce the tank pressure, Young transferred some of the RCS System A propellants to ascent propellant tanks and, by making several such transfers, was able to maintain the System A pressures at about 180 psi.  Prior to the Powered Descent, Young had to perform several transfers in order to maintain the RCS pressure at the desired levels but, eventually system A was used for the landing.
||alsj|Once the high-gain and RCS problems were resolved, Young and Duke undocked and moved the LM away from the Command Module Casper at 96 hours 14 minutes.  They were near the low point in their orbit and planned to begin the descent on the next pass, two hours later.  During this final orbit prior to PDI, Young and Duke would complete their preparations for the landing and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly would make a third SPS burn in order to put himself in a circular, 60-mile-high orbit in which he would perform three days of observations and from which, if necessary, he could maneuver to rendezvous with the LM in the event of an emergency lift-off.
|Duke|alsj|The big (CSM) problem came an hour before we were to land when Mattingly reported a problem in his spacecraft.
||alsj|Like the LM Descent engine, the direction of thrust of the CSM SPS engine could be varied by rotation around a set of gimbals and, during a pre-ignition checkout of the SPS system, at about 97 hours 30 minutes, Ken Mattingly felt his spacecraft begin to shake when he checked the backup servo-mechanical system associated with the yaw axis.  Details can be found in sections 9.6.4 and 14.1.10 of the Apollo 16 Mission Report and in Chapter 12 of Andrew Chaikin's </i>A Man on the Moon<i>.  About a week before launch, the mission rules had been changed so that, if there were any problems in either the primary or backup SPS gimbal systems at this point in the mission, the circularization burn could not be performed and, therefore, this problem in the yaw backup system meant that the mission was in jeopardy.
||alsj|Mattingly had discovered the problem while the two spacecraft were over the Lunar Farside and it was obvious to the crew that there would be no landing on this orbit.  According to the Mission Report, &quot;during pre-flight discussions, the flight controllers and the crew had agreed that, in the event of a 'no-go' for powered descent, a 'brute force' rendezvous would be executed when the LM and CSM were at their closest point of approach, approximately 2000 feet.  The LM and CSM crews discussed execution of the join up, but decided not to expend CSM RCS propellant until ground personnel had an opportunity to assess the situation.  The LM crew then turned to the section of the checklist which was the wave-off for powered descent and configured the systems for normal lunar orbit.&quot;
||alsj|Once the two spacecraft were back in contact with Houston, two complete tests of the gimbal systems were performed so that engineers on the ground could evaluate the situation.  Once the tests were complete, Houston requested that the crews perform the &quot;brute force&quot; rendezvous at their next closest approach at about 99 hours.
||alsj|&quot;Duke - I thought we were going to abort.  John and I were really sad.  It looked like we weren't going to get to land; which is a bitter pill to swallow there, because, you could look down and, at perigee, it was (planned to be) eight miles above the landing site.&quot;
||alsj|The &quot;brute force&quot; rendezvous was to have taken place at the high point in the orbit, over the lunar Farside.  At the time, the Command Module was in the lead by about a half mile.  In order to perform the rendezvous, Mattingly would fire the CSM RCS against his orbital motion and let the LM catch up with him.  However, as Mattingly began the maneuver, Young became concerned about the effect the maneuver would have on relative position and speeds of the two spacecraft at the low point in their orbits and decided to terminate the rendezvous until further discussions could be held with the experts in Houston.  Those discussions took place as soon as the two spacecraft had re-established communications with Earth and it was then decided to perform the rendezvous near the low point in the orbit when the two spacecraft were about 7000 feet apart.  The rendezvous was performed at about 100 hours without incident.
||alsj|For two hours, Houston considered the data and the options and, in the end, decided to proceed with the landing.  As Ken Mattingly later told Andrew Chaikin, this is not the decision he would have made.  Mattingly knew the spacecraft inside and out and, in hindsight, was aware that the margins of safety in this particular situation were slimmer than Houston thought.  However, at the time, he was eager to see the mission continue and wasn't about to question this apparent act of boldness on Houston's part. (See Andrew Chaikin's </i>A Man on the Moon<i> for details.)  At about 102 hours, Houston gave the crew of Apollo 16 a Go to perform the landing, with the descent now scheduled to begin at 104 hours, 17 minutes 25 seconds, three orbits and six hours late.
|<a name="GoToLand">Duke</a>|alsj|When they gave us a Go, we were really excited!  We were really pressed (for time) prior to (the original) undocking (because of the high-gain and RCS problems), but we got everything done. You know, we caught up, overcame our problems, undocked - and then Ken had his problem.  And, while they looked at that, you know, we were just floating around, really.  Just orbiting, after we got rendezvoused, waiting for them to decide what to do.  Then, when we got to go - Jim Irwin had given us the Go - we were really excited, I remember.  So we got ready for PDI.
||alsj|One consequence of the landing delay was a postponement of the first EVA.  Young and Duke had awakened at about 91:30 and had planned to perform a full, eight-hour EVA after landing.  According to the original flight plan, they would have gotten to sleep at about 113 hours, at the end of a 21 1/2 hour day.  In order to perform the EVA after the delayed landing, they were looking at a 27 1/2 hour day and, in Houston, Flight Director Gerry Griffin was unwilling to test the crew's endurance to that extent.
|Duke|alsj|They were beginning to say, 'You're going to be up 35 hours' or something like to the end of the EVA and maybe we ought think about sleeping first.  We agreed to that, but it turned out I wish we hadn't.  I wish we had gone on out and stuck to our timeline, because it required a lot of changes in the procedures once we landed.  You know, we had to change all the checklists, change all the timelines.  This was a big mess.
||alsj|During the final minutes before receiving permission to perform the landing, Young and Duke made a final check of their switch and circuit breaker configurations, yawed the spacecraft 20 degrees to improve communications with Earth, activated RCS System A, activated the Digital Event Timer, aligned the Primary Guidance and Navigation System (PGNS) and the Abort Guidance System (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="new" target="alsj">AGS</a>), and, five minutes before PDI, closed the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LMRadars.html" target="new" target="alsj">landing radar</a> circuit breaker to power it up.
|Young|tech|As we were coming around the corner for PDI, we didn't have high-gain and our yawing was 20 degrees for the descent.  Charlie says we're on the omnis and we couldn't get lockup for the state vector that we needed to do PDI.  About 12 minutes  prior to PDI, Charlie suggested that we roll (means yaw) right 20 degrees.  We rolled (means yawed) right 20 degrees, and it improved the comm margins considerably.  I think it's something that everybody who's going to work omnis should think about - putting the omni antenna toward Earth as best they can to get that update - because it was 12 minutes before we got that update.  I figured we were almost in another wave-off situation.  That was a good suggestion and we did PDI from it - off nominal.  We did it from zero yaw all the way down.
||alsj|Journal Contributor Roland Spetch writes, &quot;Rotations about the three axes of a vhecile are known as roll, pitch, and yaw. In an airplane, roll is the rotation about the flight direction, pitch is the rotation about the wing axis, and yaw is the rotation about the vertical axis. Similarly for the LM crew, facing the hatch, roll is the rotation about an axis going from their backs through the hatch, pitch is the rotation about their left/right axis, and yaw is the rotation about the axis that runs up through the docking adapter.&quot;]
|Duke|tech|If you consider trimming RCS maneuvers in the LM, there's no question in the real world that the thing's maneuvering.  You can tell what jets are firing.  You can, in fact, hear the jets when you have your helmet off.  At 2 degrees a second in the lunar module, you can feel the rotation rate.  Like Ken said yesterday (in the portion of the Technical Debrief related to Command Module operations), I never felt the rotation rate in the Command Module, but in the LM at 2 degrees a second, you can sure feel it.  And (there is) no question in your mind which way you're going and which jets came on.
|Duke|tech|We had a pretty tough time with the high bit rate, due to the loss of (the) steerable antenna.
|Young|tech|They weren't getting lockup coming around (to) the PDI.  Man, I was really sweating that when you said 'roll, let's take the yaw out.'  And we did it and they got lockup.  That was a cool move.  That put the omni antenna right at the Earth.  That may have been just the margin we needed, 12 minutes prior to PDI.  I thought we were in trouble then.
|Duke|tech|Me, too.  I thought it was really gone.  The up-link was always clear, and we didn't have any garbled transmissions.  So I had no trouble with the PADs.
||alsj|A &quot;PAD&quot; (Preliminary Advisory Data in NASA-ese) is a set of data read up by the ground and entered by the crew on a pre-printed form.  This data was used to update the computer and could be used in the event that communications with Houston was lost.
|Duke|tech|The ground kept saying that we were really noisy - really horrible.  So I used a louder voice.  I know on Apollo 10 (when Charlie was CapCom and John was Command Module Pilot), we had a couple of revs of that and it's really miserable (as CapCom) trying to get things passed back and forth.
|Young|tech|We sure did, didn't we, come to think of it.
||alsj|Transmissions from the LM could be noisy because the LM antenna was small and there was not much broadcast power available.  Transmissions from Earth to the LM were rarely noisy because there was virtually unlimited power available.  Only poor pointing of the spacecraft antenna degraded transmissions from Earth.
||alsj|During the 1972 Technical Debrief, John and Charlie then turned to the question of their original plan to perform PDI on the orbit immediately following undocking and then do an EVA immediately after landing.
|Young|tech|If Ken had done the circ(ularization) burn, we wouldn't have had any trouble doing the PDI on that rev, so I think that the (pre-flight) decision to cut a rev out of the timeline was perfectly safe.  It didn't work out (because of the CSM gimbal problem) and there may be other reasons why it wouldn't work out in the future; but, if you think positively, there's no reason the timeline itself doesn't constrain it to doing the PDI after the first rev.
|Duke|tech|Even with all our communications problems, in doing the manual updates to P27, we got a little behind there.  But, by the time we got to circ, we were caught up.  And I agree with John.  I think that the timeline was adequate and I recommend it for 17, if they plan to get out first.
||alsj|The Apollo 17 crew followed this recommendation and began their powered descent 2 hours 22 minutes after separation from the Command Module.  In comparison, on Apollo 15 the interval was 3 hours 51 minutes.  The difference represents a considerable savings in LM consumables that could then be used for a longer stay on the surface.
|Young|tech|One thing in favor of getting out first is you've already got your pressure suit on, and you don't have to go through all that Mickey Mouse again.  Boy, I tell you, that taking that rascal on and off, you got what I consider the worst part of your prep already done.  And I think that ought to be considered as a factor in this business.
||alsj|One reason that John and Charlie were able to get ready to do PDI on the first rev after undocking is that they omitted a calibration of the Landing Point Designator (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="new" target="alsj">LPD</a>).  After pitchover, with LPD activated, John was able to click his handcontroller left, right, forward, or back to make a small, discrete change in the targeted landing point.  Prior to PDI, he had planned to perform a test of the LPD calibration using the Crewman Optical Alignment Sight (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#coas" target="new" target="alsj">COAS</a>), - which was mounted in his window for use during rendezvous.  During the test, John would have maneuvered the spacecraft so that the LPD was properly aligned with the CSM or some other object and then would have made sure that computer readouts were consistent.
|Duke|tech|We didn't do the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../coas.htm" target="new" target="alsj">COAS</a> calibration or the LPD calibration due to being behind, thanks to the comm problems on that first rev.  As it turned out, everything was perfect.
|Young|tech|Yes; and, as a matter of fact, for any reasonable rendezvous or any reasonable landing, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../coas.htm" target="new" target="alsj">COAS</a> calibration and the LPD calibration are just something to take up time in the timeline.  Those things are done on the ground, and they're done perfectly adequately, based on our experience.  And it costs you gas, too, because they're 2 degree-per-second maneuvers to get to them and they perturb the orbit.
104:05:25||alsj|They have been transmitting in push-to-talk mode.  They switch to voice-activated (VOX) and we hear Charlie midway thru a sentence.
104:07:37||alsj|The Abort and Abort Stage buttons would have been used in the event of aborts using the descent engine or the ascent engine, respectively.
104:07:37||alsj|David Woods has provided scans of pages 15 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/A15LMCueCardsp15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1.0Mb</a> ) and 16 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/A15LMCueCardsp16.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1.0Mb</a> ) from the <a  href="../a15/a15LMCueCrds.htm" target="new">Apollo 15 Lunar Module Cue Cards</a>, which cover various abort scenarios.  On page 16, for a return to orbit using either the descent engine (lefthand column) or the ascent engine (righthand column), The Commander would check the position of the Guidance Switch and then push the appropriate button.</i></blockquote>
104:13:31|Duke|alsj|I'm probably talking about the attitude and all of the PGNS information.
104:13:31||alsj|Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien notes, &quot;Right before the Powered Descent begins, the computer displays the desired attitude for the burn. By pressing the 'Pro' key on the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#DSKY" target="new" target="alsj">DSKY</a>, the crew is accepting the attitude and is allowing the computer to perform any necessary adjustments. Usually, the crew had already maneuvered the LM to exactly the desired attitude, so there was little need for the computer to trim the attitude.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:14:07|Jones|alsj|I assume that you were using the watches as backups to the Digital Event Timer (DET) and that you were making sure that the DET and the watches were running at the same speed.  Is that right?
104:14:07|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  It was that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../omega.html" target="new" target="alsj">Omega Speedmaster</a> that we wore.  It had a stopwatch on it; and, every time we had a major burn event like that, I would use the stopwatch as a backup to our event timer.  During training, you'd forget to wind your watch; and you'd look down about halfway through the burn and the thing had stopped.  They were just wind-up watches in those days; they weren't quartz or anything like that, so we had to make sure we wound them.  So I made it a practice that, (chuckling) every time we got to a major event like that, I was going to make sure my watch was wound up.
104:15:16||alsj|This is probably a reference to their altitude at PDI as projected by the Primary Guidance and Navigation System (PGNS).  A nautical mile is about 6080 feet or 1853 meters.  They had planned to start PDI at 50,000 feet or a bit over 8 nautical miles; but, as noted above, are actually going to start the descent at 66500 feet or 10.9 nautical miles.  Note that Charlie is not being precise in his conversion of feet to nautical miles.   Because they are starting high, during the initial phases of the burn, the computer will bring them down at a higher than normal rate until they are on the planned path.
104:15:16|Duke|tech|We started high and to the south, (at) about 16,000 feet high, as a matter of fact.
104:15:16|Young|tech|16,000 feet high?
104:15:16|Duke|tech|Yes, we started (at) About 66,000 feet.
104:15:16|Young|tech|And we were about 16,000 feet to the south (of the planned descent track), also.
104:15:16|Duke|tech|Right after throttle down, we were back on standard (descent) profile.
104:15:16|Young|tech|Yes, it was really beautiful.
104:15:31||alsj|The Master Arm switch provides power that will open the engine fuel valves.  The two lights that have just come on - one for altitude and one for velocity - indicate that the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LMRadars.html" target="new" target="alsj">radar</a> is not yet receiving usable returns from the lunar surface.
104:15:33|O'Brien|alsj|367 is an <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="new" target="alsj">AGS</a> memory address what shows the LM altitude rate.
104:16:13||alsj|Charlie is asking Houston if they want him to do Doppler ranging on the Command Module with the LM VHF system.
104:16:21||alsj|David Woods has released an annotated version of the DAC (16-mm film) footage that includes the air-to-ground audio and transcript plus commentary. Synchronization is superb, of course.  Available on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSXhb3J05ps&spfreload=10" target="new" target="alsj">17:17</a>.
104:16:48||alsj|Because they are in zero gravity, the helium and propellants in the tanks are mixed and, just prior to PDI, the computer will fire the RCS thrusters against the direction of motion.  This acceleration will move the fuel to the engine-ward part of the tank and the helium in the other direction, thereby ensuring that, when the valves open, it will be propellant and not the inert helium that flows into the combustion chamber.]</i></blockquote>
104:17:07||alsj|John will perform a manual ullage burn in the event that the computer doesn't.  The X-axis is the thrust axis and plus-X is the up direction.
104:17:36|O'Brien|alsj|Descent Engine Command Override allowed the crew to use the Thrust/Translational Hand Controllers (TTHC) to directly override the computer-commanded throttle setting of the Descent Engine. This would be necessary if full manual control were desired over the Descent Engine thrust.
104:17:36||alsj|For the first 26 seconds of the burn, the engine will run at 10 percent thrust.
104:17:36|O'Brien|alsj|The LM descent engine was gimbaled much like the SPS engine. One of the reasons for the 10% thrust at the beginning of powered descent was to allow the gimbal actuators to point the engine through the LM center of gravity. Once the initial gimbaling was done, the engine throttled up to 93%.  The actuators were intentionally very slow (something like 0.2 degrees per second) and transients like fuel sloshing could happen too fast for them to compensate.  The RCS system compensated for all this after throttle up.  The LM ascent engine was not gimbaled.
104:17:49||alsj|Here, John is counting up to throttle up to 93 percent thrust at 26 seconds into the burn.
104:17:57||alsj|They is a reference to Houston's pre-PDI predictions of the PDI altitude based on tracking data.]</i></blockquote>
104:18:32||alsj|H-dot is the time derivative of height (H) or, in other words, their rate of descent.
104:18:36||alsj|Their typical descent rate will be 116 feet per second and John may be saying that their descent rate has built up to 45 feet per second.  John occasionally has trouble with his word choices and I am inclined to believe that he meant to say &quot;down at 45, already&quot;.
104:19:01||alsj|That is, the descent rate is about twice the planned rate at this point in the descent as the computer moves them down to the planned trajectory.
104:19:05||alsj|Jim's call of &quot;169&quot; refers to a change in the first register of Noun 69, which is the east/west component of any landing site correction.  Charlie will enter 'plus 00800 into the computer to move their target point 800 feet downrange (west).
104:19:12||alsj|Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld notes that the ability to update the LM targeting &quot;was added on Apollo 12. DLAND - Noun 69 - was an unusual vector! It  was added to the Position of the landing site (RLS) <b>every</b> 2-second  cycle, then zeroed. The crew had to verify that the three registers were all balls (all zero), then only put the Delta Z value (downrange change in  position) in R1, then only press enter when MCC looked at the DSKY  downlist to verify that the number was good. A bad Noun 69 was an easy way for the crew to mess up the landing.&quot;
104:19:31||alsj|Charlie is probably saying that they will have to change the spacecraft yaw at 3 minutes.
104:19:52||alsj|Charlie is comparing the two computers and they are giving nearly identical readings of the three velocity components.
104:20:31||alsj|These are the batteries that would provide power to the small <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html" target="new" target="alsj">explosive charges</a> that would separate the two LM stages in the event of an abort.
104:20:46||alsj|They are beginning to get <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LMRadars.html" target="new" target="alsj">radar</a> returns from the surface, much earlier than they had expected.  They are now about 3:20 into the burn and, according to figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf7-2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">7-2</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission Report, their altitude is about 57,000 feet.
104:21:30||alsj|The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LMRadars.html" target="new" target="alsj">landing radar</a> is now getting good returns from the lunar surface.
104:21:38|O'Brien|alsj|Charlie's reaction to the unexpectedly good performance of the landing radar at 50,000 feet is well founded. The landing radar was designed to provide good altitude data below 25,000 feet, and velocity data below 18,000 feet.  In previous missions, it locked on at about 40,000 feet.
104:21:59|Jones|alsj|When the lights are on, the radar is not getting returns from the surface.  Is that right?
104:21:59|Duke|alsj|That's right.  And as soon as those go out, you can incorporate that information into the computer.
104:21:59|Jones|alsj|Is a light generally an indication of something that is not working?
104:21:59|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
104:21:59|Jones|alsj|And when the light goes out, it's normal operation and you don't have to worry about it.
104:21:59|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  That's typical airplane...(Pause)  When the lights go out, it means that the radar signal strength is reliable and then, at that point, we accepted it.
104:21:59|Jones|alsj|So the computer didn't actually use the data until you told it it was okay.
104:21:59|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And I've forgotten what you did to accept it, but then the computer started using it to update its trajectory.
104:21:59|O'Brien|alsj|A Verb 57 was entered on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../dsky_lm.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">DSKY</a> to tell the computer to begin accepting radar data.
104:21:59||alsj|The PGNS uses data from both the LM inertial platform and the radar to update its knowledge of the spacecraft location and velocities while the AGS uses only data from a set of &quot;strap-on&quot; gyros.  Now that the PGNS has radar data, it will revise its altitude estimates.   <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.mr7_3.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 7-3</a> in the Apollo 15 Mission Report shows the effect that acceptance of the radar data had on the PGNS altitude estimates during the descent that Dave Scott and Jim Irwin flew.]
104:21:59|Jones|alsj|What was your attitude towards the AGS.  It was primarily designed as an abort...
104:21:59|Duke|alsj|We had a lot of confidence in it.  It worked real good.  We had some good rendezvous in training with the AGS.  I was positive it could get us back to orbit if we lost the PGNS on descent.
104:21:59|Jones|alsj|Gene and Jack said that, if the PGNS had failed during the final stages of descent, they had confidence in the AGS to actually go in with it and land.
104:21:59|Duke|alsj|Yeah. I think you could land with it; it was good enough on the attitude control.  As far as holding attitudes and stuff like that, you could fly it.  Of course, to me, you would have to descend a little bit slower without your radar ranging and stuff like that.  Without landing radar information, I think it would have been a little bit difficult to tell exactly how high you were above the Moon.  The dust and the shadow was probably the two primary indicators of getting close.  But I was glad we had<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LMRadars.html" target="new" target="alsj"> landing radar</a>, because it looked like to me, a couple of times, we were higher than we were; but the landing radar was giving us good information.  And the dust...On previous missions, they picked up dust a little bit earlier than we did, apparently.  So I had that mindset: that the dust was going to come in (at) 80-90 feet when it really didn't.  As I look back at the videos and listen to the audio that was supposed to be synched to that - on the 16mm camera - the dust started a lot later than I had expected.
104:22:51||alsj|David Woods notes that Charlie is looking at the difference - called 'Delta-H' - between the height above the lunar surface the computer has calculate from the acceleration date it gets from the inertial platform with the height it's getting from the landing radar.
104:23:14||alsj|Charlie is consulting a table on page 7 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16LMTimelinep7.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">442k</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM_Timeline.html" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 16 LM Timeline book</a>.
104:23:27|Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld|alsj|Up on the CDR's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_panel01_prplnt_qty_mon.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">main panel beside the timers</a> were two small digital EL (Electro-Luminescent) displays that showed fuel and oxidizer percent remaining. The crew could monitor either set of tanks by pushing the PRPLNT QTY MON switch to DES 1 or DES 2 depending on which was more conservative (Houston would make the call). The LMP would just look over and call out the lowest number.   Here, Charlie is also comparing the readout with a chart of expected values.
104:23:58|Jones|alsj|What do you mean by 'sun angle's getting down there'?
104:23:58|Duke|alsj|We're gaining shadow.  We're going into sunset.  Toward the terminator.  As you approach the terminator, the shadows get longer and longer and longer.
104:23:58||alsj|This statement suggests that Charlie was able to see some of the lunar surface north of their ground track.  Note that, when he says 'sunset', he means that, from their perspective in the LM, traveling west, the Sun is about to set.  At the landing site, it is actually early morning and, from a ground-based perspective, the LM is approaching the sunrise terminator.
104:24:15||alsj|At 7:23, the computer will cut the throttle setting to 55 percent.
104:24:16||alsj|H-dot is the time derivative of height and, therefore, is the descent rate.
104:24:39||alsj|In common American usage, &quot;doing a 360&quot; means turning a complete circle.  That meaning doesn't make sense in this context (unless he's joking), if for no other reason than the fact that Charlie would have gotten wrapped up in his hoses!
104:24:39|Duke|alsj|(Looking at page 7 in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM_Timeline.html" target="new" target="alsj">LM timeline book</a>) We're setting up the AGS.  That 223 is an entry into the AGS.  You got it ready to go, but you Entered it at 14,000 feet.
104:24:39|O'Brien|alsj|The '223' entry is simply a manual altitude update to the AGS.  In this case, Charlie recognizes that a significant update is necessary. He has keyed in an update telling the AGS that it is at 14,000 feet, but has not yet pressed the 'Enter' key, which is necessary to send the command to the computer. He will press Enter at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1042616" target="new" target="alsj">104:26:16</a>, as Orion passes thru 14,000 feet.&quot;]
104:24:39|Duke|alsj|And the 360 is another AGS entry.
104:24:39|O'Brien|alsj|(AGS entry) 360 displays the LM X-axis velocity (parallel with the descent engine).  From this display, Charlie sees the descent rate is 172 feet per second down.  367 is a related entry, which is the altitude rate (H-dot) of the LM.&quot;]
104:24:39|Jones|alsj|After you do the 360, then you start the sequence camera.&quot;]
104:24:39|Duke|alsj|You do a Noun 69, Enter, you do a 223, Enter at 14k, then a 360, Enter, then a sequence camera, on.
104:24:39|O'Brien|alsj|Noun 69 displays LM velocities relative to the landing site in all three axis.
104:25:33||alsj|Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-1</a> from the Apollo 16 Mission Report shows John's heart rate during the landing.  During the initial phases of the descent, his heart-rate was only in the low 70s but, now that he can see the landing site, we can see his level of excitement increase.  His peak rate of about 105 comes at pitchover.  At touchdown, his heart rate will be about 90 beats per minute.  For comparison, Neil Armstrong's peak rate was 150 and occurred at touchdown.  Alan Shepard's peak was 100 at touchdown; Dave Scott's was about 98 at touchdown; and Gene Cernan's was 95 at touchdown.  Because Pete Conrad experienced bothersome skin irritation under the sensors during the first few days of Apollo 12, he removed the sensor and tried to re-apply it, but later removed it entirely.  We have no data on his heart-rate during the descent.
104:25:50||alsj|The following is taken from the Apollo 16 Mission Report.  &quot;At 20,000 feet, based on a pre-mission study which indicated the possibility of viewing the landing site prior to pitchover, the Commander put his eye near the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../coas.htm" target="new" target="alsj">COAS</a> position and he was able to see nearly parallel to the minus-X axis (that is, out the bottom of the window past the descent engine).  The western edge of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater were clearly visible.  It was apparent from the early view that the Lunar Module was targeted nearly perfectly into the landing site ellipse.&quot;
104:26:03||alsj|There are two propellant monitoring systems.
104:26:03|Jones|alsj|When they say 'monitor descent 1', is that the conservative choice or is it the one they think is more accurate?
104:26:03|Duke|alsj|It's the one that's the lowest.  It would be the conservative choice.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:26:29||alsj|As the descent continues, the spacecraft is slowly tilting toward the upright position.  At pitchover, there will be a large change in the spacecraft orientation and John will get his first clear view of the landing site.  However, as he mentioned in the Mission Report, &quot;At approximately 14,000 feet, the entire landing site - <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Flag, Spook, and Double Spot Craters</a> - became visible to the Commander.&quot;
104:26:56||alsj|According to the Mission Report, pitchover occurred at 7200 feet.  Charlie is looking to the right (north) of the flight path.  In the 16-mm film, Gator is the large crater at the bottom of the window and Lone Star is the small, sharp-rimmed crater on the eastern, outer flank of Gator.  The next large crater beyond Gator is Palmetto.  The large crater beyond Palmetto at the righthand edge of the window is Kiva.
104:26:56|Young, from the Mission Report|alsj|At pitchover, you could see - just like pre-flight (simulations)  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.4623lbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Gator, Palmetto, and Spook, and the inverted, deep shadow pattern through Stubby, Wreck, Trap, Eden Valley, and Cove</a>, right into Spook - although, at 15-degrees Sun angle, it wasn't as apparent (as in the simulations).&quot;]
104:26:56||alsj|Had they landed on time, six hours earlier, the Sun would have been 12 degrees above the local horizon, rather than 15.  John's view is to the left (south) of the flight path although, evidently, he could see far enough north to have  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Gator and Palmetto</a> in view at pitchover.]
104:26:56|Young, from the Mission Report|alsj|Of course, we had already seen the landing site on two other occasions when we were flying over it - because of the three rev slip.  There's just no doubt in your mind when you're at pitchover, and the first thing you see was South Ray.  There was some question about whether we'd see the ray patterns (out of South Ray) at the low Sun angle, but there's no doubt that we were seeing the ray patterns from South Ray at pitchover; and there's no doubt, at least in my mind, as to where the machine was flying to.  And it was a simple matter to redesignate and back up a hair.
104:27:00||alsj|The window in front of John is  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lpdin.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">scribed</a> with two sets of vertical and horizontal scales, one on the inside and one on the outside.  If he stands so that the two sets of scales are lined up, once Charlie gives him a number from the computer, he can then find the point where the computer thinks they are going to land.  This number - called the Landing Point Designator (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="new" target="alsj">LPD</a>) angle - marks the position of the computer's target on the vertical scale.  If John wants to move the target, he clicks the handcontroller left or right, forward or aft.]
104:27:00||alsj|Randy Attwood has provide a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lpdin.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photo</a> of the LPD scale in LM-9, the H-mission-capable vehicle scheduled for Apollo 15 before that flight became a J-mission.<p></i></blockquote>
104:27:02|Young, from the Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|After pitchover, a comparison of the Landing Point Designator with the computer and the movement of the vehicle showed that, if no further trajectory corrections were made, the Lunar Module would land approximately 600 meters north and 400 meters west of the center of the landing ellipse.  Therefore, between altitudes of 3000 and 4000 feet, an estimated total of five redesignations to the south were made.  The vehicle responded properly.
104:27:02|Young|tech|I think the LPD was perfect.  I don't have any gripes there whatsoever.  When we pitched over, we were north and long and you could see that.  I was just letting the LM float in there until I could see where it was going.  I took out the north because, according to our pre-flight maps, the north country was a little rougher.  There were more (map) contour lines up north and down south; so we took those out and, when we got in close, we backed up a little and put in some rear updates.  I don't remember how many there were.
104:27:02||alsj|When John said &quot;so we took those out&quot;, he meant that he corrected the targeting so that he wouldn't be either north of the target or long.  See John's commentary after  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1042720" target="new" target="alsj">104:27:20</a>.] </i></blockquote>
104:27:06||alsj|Charlie was the only LMP who made detailed comments on the landing site at pitchover.  Others glanced out, but made no comments.  The LMP's main job was to watch the computer and provide the Commander with  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="new" target="alsj">LPD</a> readings and values of altitude, descent rate, and forward velocity.  Frank O'Brien plausibly suggests that, when Ed Mitchell <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a14/a14.landing.html#1081232" target="new" target="alsj">glanced out</a> his window to check the LM's position relative to Cone Crater, he may have also been checking out traverses to the crater rim.  In both cases, the LMP could see important areas to the north that were hidden from the Commander's view by LM structure.]
104:27:06|Duke|tech|We'd agreed (pre-flight) that I was going to look out since I had two good craters on my side (Palmetto and Dot); and it looked just like the L&amp;A.
104:27:06||alsj|Readers should note that Dot Crater is named for Charlie's wife Dotty.  It is a small, bright, sharp-rimmed crater, not unlike the charming Mrs. Duke.
104:27:06||alsj|The L&amp;A was a model of the landing site which provided a view of the landing site which was shown in the windows of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">LM simulator</a>.  The L&amp;A was ceiling mounted and, on the floor, a television camera was moved in response to the simulated LM motions.  The accompanying <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../TRAIN01.JPG" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photo</a> was provided by Frank O'Brien and shows the L&amp;A to the left of the LM simulator.
104:27:06|Jones|alsj|Did you get the L&amp;A fairly early in the training cycle?
104:27:06|Duke|alsj|We had it about six months, total.  You know we delayed a month.  They delayed us to April.  We were originally supposed to go in March; and then they had a problem with the RCS on the Command Module.  I forget what that was but, anyway, it gave us another month for training, so if I remember right, we had about 6 months with the L&amp;A.  And it was real accurate.
104:27:06|Jones|alsj|Did you guys ever get in the simulator and use the L&amp;A to fly around the landing site at low altitude.
104:27:06|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we did.  And that was real helpful.  We'd just fill up the gas and just fly around.  The problem with the L&amp;A was the maps.  You know, the maps were only 15 meter resolution and, so, there was nothing on the L&amp;A that was below the 15-meter resolution.  So, when you got down close, you started seeing these, you know, these little ridges and contours that weren't visible on the maps.  But just the general overview of the area was good.  And that's why we recognized everything when we made pitchover.
104:27:06|Jones|alsj|And you were fairly equatorial, so there would have been good, high-resolution Lunar Orbiter coverage of this site.
104:27:06|Duke|alsj|I don't think we had Lunar Orbiter (photos)...I'm not sure where they got it from.  I was always under the impression that they got the maps from Apollo 14.  (True.)  (Stu) Roosa (the Apollo 14 CMP) came over our landing sight and he took a lot of pictures of our landing site.  So most of our stuff, I believe, came from that (Apollo 14 coverage).
104:27:06||alsj|Charlie's quick look out to the north served a dual purpose.  First, it gave him a chance to check their position so that, if they were off target, he could tell John.  Second, it gave him a chance to see if they would be able to drive to North Ray Crater on EVA-3.
104:27:06|Duke|alsj|There was a lot of speculation among the geological community, based on our (pre-flight) photographs, that we were going to have a rough road to go once we got up near North Ray Crater - that we might not be able to get up to the rim.  But at pitchover, you know, I just looked out to the right to see what it looked like, 'cause John couldn't see it from his side.  And it looked real good.  Plus, I'd had a dream about some tracks being up that way and, out of curiosity, (laughing) I was checking to see if I could see the tracks.
104:27:06|Jones|alsj|You talk about that in your book, </i>Moonwalker<i>, (on pages 199-200): that you came across some Rover tracks on the drive to North Ray, followed them, and found a Rover with two dead astronauts on it.  They looked like you and John, but they'd been there for thousands of years.
104:27:06|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  But we didn't see any tracks, of course.  But it was real real in the dream - this set of tracks.
104:27:06||alsj|&quot;It was up there on that valley floor after you pass Palmetto going up towards North Ray.  There was a big low area, real smooth, and then, from there on, it climbed back up to North Ray.  And we were expecting that it would be blocky up there, but it wasn't.  We could see it all; and there were no tracks and no blocks; so we were going to be able to make it.&quot;
104:27:06|Jones|alsj|Was there also some descent-specific reason for you to be looking out the window?  In most cases, the LMPs were glued to the computer during the final phase.
104:27:06|Duke|alsj|Well, I was, after this initial look.  I wanted to help John...John and I trained that way.  That I was going to help him verify where we were.  The thought was, you know, if we were off, maybe two eyes looking out to figure out exactly where we were.  But at pitchover there, of course, we recognized the craters.  Palmetto, Dot, North Ray I recognized.  And then I just started looking up there because we'd had such a big problem with our discussions with our geologists about making it to North Ray.  They were concerned about it because the photographs showed a lot of blocks up there on that mountain up to the north of North Ray.  So I just wanted to make sure we could do it.
104:27:06||alsj|&quot;John got on me a little bit, and said 'give me the numbers', you see.  'Call me the things, Charlie'.  So, I was out of the cockpit (meaning, looking outside) there, then I got back in the cockpit (that is, focusing attention on the computer) (and) gave him the numbers, then I looked out again and that's where I told him we could make it.  From then on, I was mostly in the cockpit.&quot;
104:27:06|Jones|alsj|So you had about a five-second scan up to the north...
104:27:06|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
104:27:19||alsj|John has just moved the landing target two clicks to the south.  As mentioned previously, he made approximately five redesignations between 3000 and 4000 feet.  A bit later, an estimated five additional redesignations were made as the Lunar Module was approaching Double Spot Crater.  According to the Mission Report, the net result of these redesignations was to move the landing site uprange (east) 620 feet (189 m) and south 635 feet (194m).  Because the effect of a redesignation made at a higher altitude is greater than one made at a lower altitude, the five corrections made between 3000 and 4000 feet had the greatest effect.
104:27:19|Young, from the Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|It was clear that the vehicle was going to be north and west of the pre-mission designated landing spot - 75 meters north of Double Spot Craters.  However, there was no major attempt to land at the pre-mission designated spot, nor had there been any intent to do so prior to the flight because the surface traverse capabilities of the Lunar Rover negated the requirement to land precisely at the designated landing spot.
104:27:43||alsj|fps descent rate).  On profile.
104:27:51||alsj|Charlie can see the computer accepting John's target redesignations.  As Frank O'Brien notes, &quot;In a moment, we see the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#LPD" target="new" target="alsj">LPD</a> go from 42 to 44 to 54 - meaning a shorter, steeper descent - so we know John redesignated the landing uprange (east).&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:28:33||alsj|Here, John is switching to manual control and no longer needs the LPD angles from Charlie.  Now he needs altitude, vertical velocity and horizontal velocity.
104:28:33|Young|tech|It was working so well I was tempted to let it (the PGNS) do the thing all by itself; but the trouble is, we got down low and I could see that we were going to land in that pothole down there.
104:28:33||alsj|The 'pothole' in question is a shallow, 15-meter crater.  John will overfly it and land with his rear foot pad about 3 meters beyond the west rim of the crater.
104:28:33|Young|tech|We took over, I guess at about 300 feet, and pitched forward a little, and we could see the surface all the way to the ground.  Right close in there, out my window, I could see that crater down there, so I went forward a little bit and landed.
104:28:33|Journal Contributor Paul Fjeld|alsj|Up on the CDR's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_panel01_prplnt_qty_mon.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">main panel beside the timers</a> were two small digital EL (Electro-Luminescent) displays that showed fuel and oxidizer percent remaining. The crew could monitor either set of tanks by pushing the PRPLNT QTY MON switch to DES 1 or DES 2 depending on which was more conservative (Houston would make the call). The LMP would just look over and call out the lowest number.
104:28:33||alsj|According to the Mission Report, &quot;At about 450 feet altitude, the Lunar Module Pilot observed the Lunar Module's shadow from his window.  At an altitude below 200 feet, as the Commander yawed the vehicle toward the right (that is, rotated right around the now-vertical thrust axis), he also noticed the shadow.&quot;
104:28:33|Young|tech|When we redesignated to the south, we must have had 30 degrees of (left) yaw and took it back out.  At that Sun angle, we could see the rocks (through the dust) all the way to the ground and I think that was a great help.  From 200 feet down, I never looked in the cockpit.  It was just like flying the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LLTV-952.html" target="new" target="alsj">LLTV</a> (Lunar Landing Training Vehicle); your reference is to the ground outside.  You had another thing that nobody has ever remarked about before, and that was the shadow.  I really didn't have any doubt in my mind how far above  the ground we were with that shadow coming down (that is, getting closer to them as they approach the surface).  I had no scale of reference to the holes; but, with the shadow out there in front of you and coming down, it really takes all of the guesswork out of it.  For that kind of Sun angle, if the radar had crumped, I don't think you'd have had a bit of trouble in just going right in and landing just like a helicopter.  First, we could see the thing (rocks and other surface features) all the way to the ground; second, the shadow was right there to help you with the rate of descent.  When Charlie says 'you stopped and you're hovering', there wasn't any doubt in my mind that I was hovering.  I could look out the window and see that we're hovering just like a helicopter.  We were well into the dust - maybe 40 or 50 feet off the ground - when we were doing that.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:28:45||alsj|Here, Charlie wants John to slow the descent.
104:28:45|Duke|alsj|He's going down too fast.  Okay?  And our profile calls for 5 foot per second, H-dot; and he's 11.  And 12 was our maximum.  And, so, I wanted him to slow down a little bit.  We were sinking too fast.  I wanted to get him closer back to profile.
104:29:22|Duke|alsj|You can watch the 16-mm; and we just stopped.  And then he gave me a couple of clicks down and we were in good shape.
104:29:22|Young|tech|We did hover for a short period of time, there, at about 40 feet off the ground, and the rates (meaning the three velocity components) were practically zero and there was blowing dust.
104:29:22|Duke|tech|It started at about 80 feet, John.
104:29:22|Young|tech|Yes, 80 feet.  Certainly it started there and it got a lot worse, but you could still see the rocks all the way to the ground.  The surface features - even the craters - which really surprised me.  I was expecting two things: either the dust would be so bad (as on Apollo 12) we couldn't see anything, or there probably wouldn't be as much dust as there was.  Possibly, it's the 15-degree sun angle that did all that.  Because there's certainly plenty of dust down there to blow, and there's nothing thin about that regolith around the LM.
104:29:22||alsj|Because of the six-hour landing delay, the Sun was about 3 degrees higher than it was at the planned landing time and John is speculating that the change in lighting made it easier to see through the dust.
104:29:22|Jones|alsj|Had you ever done any carrier operations?
104:29:22|Duke|alsj|No.  Well, as a passenger I've landed on a carrier a few times, but never as a pilot.
104:29:22|Jones|alsj|I ask everybody this question.  Was it luck of the draw or something to do with carrier training that five of the six Commanders were Navy trained.
104:29:22|Duke|alsj|I think it was the luck of the draw - just the fact that the guys in the second and the third group of astronauts that were still around were Navy.  Most of them.  Of course, Dave Scott wasn't.  It just turned out that way, I think.  For instance, if you look at those groups, Borman had left and Ed White had been killed and Gus Grissom had been killed...And they were Air Force, you see.  Stafford had flown on Apollo 10 but, about that time, they were announcing the Russian mission (Apollo Soyuz) and he decided he wanted to go work on that.  Jim McDivitt was in management at that point.  McDivitt was actually Apollo Program Manager at the time we flew.  So, it was just the way people's careers were going and their desires; and it just turned out the Navy guys stayed around.
104:29:22|Duke|tech|When the computer said (we'd) leveled off...there was no question in your mind that you'd stopped coming down.
104:29:36|Young|tech|When we got the Contact light, I counted the 'one-potato' and shut the engine down.  The thing fell out of the sky the last 3 feet.  I know it did.  I don't know how much we were coming down, maybe a foot a second.
104:29:36|Duke|tech|I don't remember exactly, but about 1.8 (fps) - I think I saw - right before touchdown.&quot;]
104:29:36|Young|tech|I wouldn't (want to) stroke that gear (by shutting down the engine earlier), man.  I'll tell you, that would really jar your teeth.
104:29:36||alsj|According the the Apollo 16 Mission Report, Table 3-I, the landing (Contact) ocurred at 104:29:35, which was 02:23:35 GMT/UTC on 21 April 1972.
104:29:46||alsj|Now that they are down, they will prepare to leave immediately, just in case there was damage to the spacecraft at contact.
104:29:57||alsj|Charlie is recycling a set of RCS propellant isolation or shut-off valves called <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ParkerValve.html" target="new" target="alsj">Parker valves</a>.  They were made by a U.S. unit of Parker-Hannifin PLC.
104:29:57|Frank O'Brien|alsj|The valve controls are on the main LMP switch panel. Each quad (that is, each of the four sets of RCS jets) is connected to two RCS systems. There are eight switches, two for each RCS quad, and have open and close settings.
104:30:23||alsj|This would put them about 250 meters north west of the planned landing site.  Post-mission analysis indicates they are 210 meters north and 60 meters west of the planned landing spot.  On the &quot;Descartes EVA-I, III Part 2 of 2&quot; map ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.6 Mb</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.5 Mb</a> ), the planned landing site is at CA.0/81.0 and they are actually near CB.1/80.6 or  8.9913  south latitude and 15.5144 degrees east longitude.  A discussion of landing site coordinates is linked <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsjcoords.html" target="new" target="alsj">here</a>.
104:30:44|Young|tech|I counted 'one-potato' after we got the Contact light and shut the engine down.  Even so, I think we fell about three feet.  I think we were very fortunate that the landing was so flat, because I really couldn't judge the slopes.  We just lucked into almost zero roll (that is, north/south tilt), a couple of degrees - or 3 degrees - pitchup (that is, backward tilt); and, of course, we'd taken the yaw out.
104:30:44|Young|tech|I couldn't judge slope out the window worth a hoot, and that's the truth.  Even down low.  The ground looks flat, but I'm sure it would look flat if it had been a 6- to 8-degree slope, too.  I don't see any way around that.  I've done a lot of helicopter flying - looking at slopes - and you can't judge slopes in a helicopter from 100 feet on down very well, either.  But I don't think you'd be in any trouble if you touched down within 10 or 15 degrees of being straight up and down.  It's going to bother you some in deploying gear off the Lunar Module, but it isn't going to bother your performance.
104:30:44||alsj|According to the Mission Report, &quot;Inspection of the region during extravehicular activity (EVA) indicated that, had the LM landed 25 meters in any direction from the actual site, it could have been on a local slope of 6 to 10 degrees.&quot;
104:30:44|Young|tech|The landing site orientation was about as flat as you can get.  Like I said, 'It's more luck than skill' (Laughter)  I hate to admit it, but it's true.  Twenty-five meters either way and we would have been on a 10-degree slope.&quot;]
104:30:44|Duke|tech|It's like landing on a carrier.&quot;]
104:30:44|Young|tech|Add 15 meters to that (25 meters in any direction), and we would have been in a hole.

104:31:05|Jones|alsj|I think you may have been the most excited person, at least on tape, of the twelve who set down on the surface.
104:31:05|Duke|alsj|I don't know about that (comparison); but I'll tell you, John and I - both - were so excited and exuberant.  And the way we had trained and the way we were friends, we just talked about it.  We just expressed our emotions, both of us.  And we were really excited.
104:31:05|Jones|alsj|It comes across.  It comes across through the whole thing.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:31:49|Jones|alsj|Was there a program alarm on the way down?&quot;]
104:31:49|Duke|alsj|Oh; no.  That was when he pulled the radar breaker (at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1043116" target="new" target="alsj">104:31:16</a>).  It gives you a program alarm.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:31:54||alsj|John's comment suggests that Charlie was startled by the Program alarm.]</i></blockquote>
104:32:21|Duke|alsj|If you look at the pictures we took, I was way off on my estimate.  We were high.  We were way high on those estimates about boulder size and about the percentage of covering over the surface. You know, we were so excited, it just looked like rocks everywhere.  And there were a lot of rocks; but they weren't that big.  And it's very difficult judging the size of objects that you've never seen before. 'Cause you really had nothing to compare 'em to, Eric.  And, so, I just made a real bad error of judgment on the percentage of coverage of the rocks and, also, on the size of 'em.&quot;]
104:32:21||alsj|We then looked at photos AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18296" target="new" target="alsj">18296</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18310" target="new" target="alsj">18310</a>, which show the view out the LM window.]

104:32:21|Duke|alsj|See, it doesn't...Hardly any rocks to speak of, now that I look at it.  But I was referring to these, like the one right there.&quot;]
104:32:21|Jones|alsj|On John's side, in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18300" target="new" target="alsj">18300</a>.
104:32:21|Duke|alsj|On John's side.  And here's one here.  And there's one on out here.  And these out here next to that crater, which was a little secondary, I think.
104:32:21|Jones|alsj|Out your side, just above and to the left of the thruster in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18307" target="new" target="alsj">18307</a>.&quot;]
104:32:21|Duke|alsj|And I estimated it....See, this ridge is actually close in.  And I estimated that ridge in here (forming the local horizon in AS16-113-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18307" target="new" target="alsj">18307</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18308" target="new" target="alsj">18308</a> as four to five meters high but I don't think it was. And you can see my estimates of the rock sizes are way off.&quot;]
104:32:21||alsj|We then looked at a pan Charlie took early in EVA-1 from a spot about 20 meters northeast of the LM.  These are frames AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18313" target="new" target="alsj">18313</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18330" target="new" target="alsj">18330</a>.]

104:32:21|Duke|alsj|This  ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18325" target="new" target="alsj">18325</a> ) is looking off to the south.&quot;]
104:32:21|Jones|alsj|And there is a smidge of rocks but not a large number.&quot;]
104:32:21|Duke|alsj|This crater, we didn't really realize it had been there.&quot;]
104:32:21|Jones|alsj|You're just on the west edge of it.
104:32:21|Duke|alsj|And I had to get the ALSEP (out of the SEQ Bay on the southeast face of the Descent Stage).  The experiments were back here in the back and, if we had been a little bit closer (to the crater), I wouldn't have been able to do that.  I'd have rolled down the hill there, into that crater. So, you can see, it looks like it's steep on this (east) side ( in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18323" target="new" target="alsj">18323</a> ), but it actually comes up in here (on the west side in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18325" target="new" target="alsj">18325</a>), too.&quot;]
104:32:21||alsj|In the following, John tells Charlie to hold off on the description of the landing site until they have word from Houston that the LM is in good shape.
104:33:22||alsj|Jim Irwin was the LMP on Apollo 15 and, on that flight, Dave Scott hit the engine-stop button quicker than any of the Commanders. Consequently, the Apollo 15 LM, Falcon, hit the ground at about 6.8 feet per second, about twice the speed that any of the other LMs touched down. It was a very hard bump.  The relatively hard Apollo 15 landing was the reason John counted 'one-potato' between the time Charlie called the contact light and John hit the stop button.]</i></blockquote>
104:33:29|Duke|alsj|'Gouge' is a term synonymous really with 'gauge'.&quot;]
104:33:29|Jones|alsj|Hmm.  I've never heard that usage before.
104:33:29|Duke|alsj|At the Naval Academy, if you had the 'gouge', that means you had the answers to the test, that type of thing.  'Gouge' is synonymous to 'reference'.  'It's a good reference.'  That's what it means.&quot;]
104:33:29|Jones|alsj|You started at the Naval Academy and then transferred?&quot;]
104:33:29|Duke|alsj|Yeah; I started at the Naval Academy and then transferred to the Air Force.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:35:02|Duke|alsj|He's referring to the G&amp;N (Guidance and Navigation) system.
104:36:24||alsj|They are both wearing <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../restraints.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">harness cables</a> which are attached at the suit waist and to anchors on the floor.  The harness cables keep them from moving around during the descent and launch.  They will remove the harness cables once Houston gives them a stay for T-2.
104:37:16||alsj|As is discussed after <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvlm1.html#1250849" target="new" target="alsj">125:08:49</a> during the return to the LM at the end of the EVA-1 traverse, &quot;FS smooth&quot; is a joking reference to a smooth geologic unit on a map John and Charlie used during a field trip during training.  Not having participated in the Apollo 16 geology training, Irwin doesn't understand the reference.]</i></blockquote>
104:38:27||alsj|There are two possible reasons for turning on the water.  One is to get a drink from the water gun through a small port at the side of the helmet; and the other is to cool themselves down by running LM water through their Liquid-Cooled Garments (LCGs).  The Apollo 15 crew did not wear their LCGs during the landing, but the Apollo 16 and 17 crews wore theirs because they planned to do EVAs immediately after landing.]
104:38:27|Jones|alsj|The squirt gun at the cheek?  Did John want to get a drink of water?&quot;]
104:38:27|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we're still helmeted at this time.  Oh, no!  It's not to drink.  It's the cooling water for the LCG, 'cause we were getting warm.&quot;]
104:38:27|Jones|alsj|The suits are not pressurized at this time, I would presume.
104:38:27|Duke|alsj|Oh, no; you can fly it. Yeah, pressurized.  Yeah, you could do that.  We did that a couple of times, with no problem.
104:38:27|Jones|alsj|It was more difficult?
104:38:27|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, the gloves were bigger and all.  Especially if you had manual control.  But you could punch the switches and all.  It was a little bit harder to hit circuit breakers and stuff with the gloves out and pressurized but, it was do-able.
104:38:27|Jones|alsj|Let's see.  You've got the IV (Intravehicular) <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a> on, the ones without the thermal covering.&quot;]
104:38:27|Duke|alsj|That's right.
104:38:27|Jones|alsj|So you would have had less bulk and a little more dexterity than with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">EVA gloves</a>?
104:38:27|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  The IV gloves were sort of in between the (bare) hand and the EVA gloves.  The EVA gloves were bulky and sometimes, to get a switch, your glove would barely fit in the switch guard.  We just practiced and we didn't have any problem with it.  You just had to be a little bit more careful.
104:38:27|Jones|alsj|And you practiced to fly pressurized in case...
104:38:27|Duke|alsj|In case you land and a window pops out or you rupture the pressure vessel and you have to go back up (with suits) pressurized.  So we had to practice that.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:39:00|Jones|alsj|Are you mis-judging the shadow length? Or is it really shorter because the ground's sloping up toward the west?&quot;]
104:39:00|Duke|alsj|It is sloping up; plus we're late landing 3 revs, so the Sun angle's higher.  My perception was that it would be a longer shadow and a farther horizon;  but, with a sloping up terrain, it made it look like we were confined, in sort of a bowl.  And that's what I meant by this.&quot;]
104:39:00||alsj|The following discussion is taken from the Apollo Technical Debrief and begins with a discussion of visual effects in the down-Sun direction, also called &quot;Zero-Phase&quot;.  At zero phase, there is a considerable amount of sunlight reflected back to the observer due to a process called <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../coherentbcksctr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Coherent Backscatter</a> and, consequently, the zero-phase direction tends to be very bright and washed out.]
104:39:00||alsj|One interesting part of the following discussion is the fact that there was a shadow in the simulation.]
104:39:00|Duke|tech|(To John) How about that Zero Phase?  I never noticed it.&quot;]
104:39:00|Young|tech|First, the thing (zero phase) starts out as a Sun (meaning a very bright patch of reflected light) coming and that turns to a (LM) shadow.  That was zero phase getting better all the time.&quot;]
104:39:00|Duke|tech|I was excited at that time.&quot;]
104:39:00|Young|tech|Yes.  When you said, 'here comes the shadow, that was before I had seen it (because the spacecraft was yawed left).  In fact, you were watching it out your window and I looked up there and I saw it, and I said, 'Yeah, man; there's no doubt.'  And that baby got bigger and bigger and dropped right down in front of us; and, man, that's a good gauge (of LM altitude).&quot;]
104:39:00|Duke|tech|Was it?
104:39:00|Young|tech|Yes, we saw it in the (16-mm) film.
104:39:00|Duke|tech|It looked just like that one in the LMS (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lunar Module Simulator</a>).
104:39:00||alsj|In the following, John addresses himself to Deke Slayton, the former Mercury astronaut who was Director of Flight Crew Operations.
104:39:00|Young|tech|I don't know if you know this, Deke; they had a shadow for us (in the simulator window view), and I guess we've been using it.  In fact, we'd been practicing (landing) without radar a couple of times just to see what you could do.  The thrust-to-weight ratio in our lunar module is such that, if you're at 100 feet and you have 20 feet a second down, if you go full throttle, you'll have that (descent rate) all killed before you hit the ground.  So (in training) we're looking at high sink rate descents off nominal with the shadow.  Man, it really makes a difference when you're looking for it.  A crater from 50,000 feet looks like a crater at 5 feet (meaning that is impossible to judge the absolute size of craters) - that's the bad part of it.  But, with a shadow, as it gets bigger, you know you're getting close.
104:39:51|Jones|alsj|There were certainly a number of people in the geologic community who were expecting that you would find basalts and other kinds of volcanic rocks, and not breccias.&quot;]
104:39:51|Duke|alsj|We had mostly trained volcanics.  We did very little on the breccias and stuff like that.  But we had seen the rocks from the earlier missions in the Lunar Receiving Lab.  I  guess we had expected it (breccias) somewhat.  But most of our training and most of the pre-flight photo-geology had basically been two classes of volcanic rock.  The Cayley Plain was one type of volcanic and the other would have been the highlands, the more viscous that created domes or hills.  And I got the impression that the geologists were really surprised when we started describing all these breccias and crystalline rocks.  And they were really...Either they thought we were dumb and, you know, really screwing up; or it was something they didn't really expect.  In my mind, at first, I thought that when I started describing these things, these guys are going to think they wasted six years of geology on these two klutzes up there on the Moon.  But then, I began to sense a general understanding (in Houston) that 'hey, things are different than we expected'.  And then, they were beginning to get excited, too.&quot;]
104:39:51|Jones|alsj|The general impression that I have all through here - starting now, but particularly when you get outside - is that you guys were well prepared.&quot;]
104:39:51|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we were.  We'd had - I guess it was - the equivalent of a master's degree in geology over the six years.  John probably didn't get as much classroom-type geology as we (the fifth astronaut group) did.  He was in the training cycle and he was going through late Gemini and early Apollo, so he didn't get the overall classroom geology training that our group got.  But we made it a plan, right after we got picked for the (Apollo 16) crew...actually, for Apollo 13 when we were backup.  We made it a practice to have one geology trip every month.&quot;]
104:39:51||alsj|John and Charlie had eighteen <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">geology field trips</a> in the nineteen months from July 1970 to February 1972.
104:39:51|Jones|alsj|Toward the end, I gather you'd go out and the geologists would be in a trailer somewhere.&quot;]
104:39:51|Duke|alsj|Yeah, and we'd have all the radios and we'd start describing. And towards the end, of course, we had the Rover mock-up that would work down here (the one-g trainer).  And that was real good, to make it more realistic.  And the geology trips we took were like to Hawaii; we went to Jackass Flats out there in Nevada where the nuclear test sites are; and we went to various other volcanically significant areas.&quot;]
104:39:51|Dr. Fred H&ouml;rz, NASA geologist, from a 2003 e-mail|alsj|The geology-training of astronauts started with general lectures and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.html" target="new" target="alsj">field trips</a> (in large groups) shortly after their astronaut selections.  Depending on these selection dates, astronauts may have had some 3-5 years of 'general' training, typically a 2-hour lecture per month, a 2-hour lab class (macroscopic rock descriptions) per month and some 2-3 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">field trips</a> per year. This training was initially under the guidance of Gene Shoemaker and Dale Jackson of the USGS, but was taken over more and more by an ever growing staff of MSC (Manned Spacecraft Center) geoscientists.&quot;]
104:39:51||alsj|&quot;In about 1969, a new geo-science management appeared at MSC under P. Gast's leadership, in anticipation of the returned samples; this new leadership team initiated a more rigorous approach, starting with Apollo 14: each crew (including back-up crew) selected for a mission was assigned a full time 'Mission Science Trainer' (A14: (Mike) McEwen; A15: (Gary) Lofgren, A16: yours truly, A17: D.Morrison) and we got two 2-hour sessions per week and a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.html" target="new" target="alsj">field trip</a> of 2-3 days per month. The weekly sessions were typically one invited talk/lecture per week and one <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#S7158014" target="new" target="alsj">lab-class</a>.
104:39:51||alsj|&quot;Ultimately all of the above 'trainers' participated in the training of all crews, but the above individuals were responsible for the overall training program of a specific mission and called the shots. Most field exercises were run in collaboration with the USGS, the official field geology team, yet the NASA-Science Trainers determined the content and substance of the overall crew-training and education, consistent with the specific mission objectives.&quot;
104:39:51||alsj|&quot;The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">field trips</a> increasingly incoporated the entire surface operations, i.e. crew was in field with vehicle, lunar sampling tools,cameras, sample bags etc and some simulated backroom was somewhere out-of sight in a tent; communication of what the crew saw and collected/documented was exclusively via radio; the 'science trainer' was with the crew as a silent observer. A substantial debriefing followed each simulated EVA, the latter typically 4-6 hours long; most of the debriefing/critique occurred while everybody walked over the entire EVA together. Most of the lab-classes served to critique additional EVA matters, such as photodocumentation, samples bagged etc., after the crew trainer spent days of pouring over the materials collected and a few hundred 'surface photos' taken, etc.&quot;
104:39:51||alsj|&quot;Thus, the training was fairly rigorous and intensive. Note that the backroom in these exercises was composed of the same folks that also manned the science support room during the actual mission; we were familiar with each individual's nuances, lingo, observational skills etc. Granted, there were differences among individual crew members but all in all: they were excellent to thoroughly impressive - that is, very smart individuals and quick learners.&quot;
104:39:51||alsj|&quot;Unfortunately, none of this is documented in great detail; a number of attempts were made, but all were aborted for one reason or another.&quot;
104:40:07||alsj|The summit of Stone Mountain is about 540 meters high and is about 5 kilometers south of the LM.  In comparison, the tallest peak at the Apollo 15 site is 4500-m Mt. Hadley and, at the Apollo 17 site, the tallest peak is the 2500-m South Massif.]</i></blockquote>
104:40:30||alsj|Charlie and I looked at AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18300" target="new" target="alsj">18300</a>, a frame from a pan taken out John's window.  There is a very bright patch just below the horizon on the right side of the picture.]
104:40:30|Duke|alsj|That's what we're probably referring to.
104:40:30|Jones|alsj|Just above and to the right of the thrusters.
104:40:30|Duke|alsj|That bright spot out there that we were thinking, maybe, was South Ray.
104:40:30|Jones|alsj|That's some of the South Ray ejecta.  You see it from lots of places.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
104:41:14||alsj|They have initiated Program Zero-Zero - pronounced &quot;Pooh&quot; - so that Houston can update the on-board computer; and they have switched the comm system to Push-to-Talk and, now, will only be heard in Houston when they activate the microphones with either a switch on the handcontroller or a cable-mounted switch attached to the suit.]</i></blockquote>
104:41:36||alsj|Charlie is getting out the Surface Checklist.  The three-orbit delay in landing and the postponement of the first EVA will both necessitate checklist changes.
104:41:47||alsj|John is obviously pleased that Houston is thinking in terms of letting him stay on the Moon as long as possible.
104:41:56||alsj|They both wore tethers - attached at the waist and to the floor - that held them steady during the descent.
104:41:56|Jones|alsj|You're fairly confined inside the LM but does the one-sixth g make a difference?
104:41:56|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  Without the harness on, you felt really free, and you had plenty of room.  You didn't mind standing up.
104:41:56|Jones|alsj|You stood most of the time?
104:41:56|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And I sort of leaned back against the Environmental Control System (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a>).  There was a little spot I could lean back against and sort of rest a little bit.  And I did that a lot when we took the suit off.  But, at this point, gosh, you just felt like you could stand there for hours - which we did, really.  It was real nice.  The only time I found the Lunar Module really confining was when we started getting suited up - or unsuited - moving the PLSSs around and all of that stuff.  Somewhere later on in here, we move one of the PLSSs (that was) on the floor between us?  And we pick it up and put it somewhere else.  We'd done that in training and John just struggled to get that thing up, 'cause it was heavy!  You know, 155 pounds.  They had a lightweight mock-up which I think was a little bit lighter.  But up there, in that one-sixth g, boy, he just picked it up with one hand.  It was just tremendous.  It made you feel like Superman.  So, no, we didn't feel too cramped at all.  It was nice.
104:42:49||alsj|They will vent pressure from the propellant tanks in the Descent Stage.  The valves are opened with small <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html" target="new" target="alsj">explosive charges</a>.  They are at the top left of Surface Checklist <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-1.jpg" title="checklist page" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-1</a>.  They had planned to reach this point in the mission at a Ground Elapsed Time of 98 hours 55 minutes (98:55) but, because of the landing delay, are six hours behind schedule.
104:43:53||alsj|Houston has determined that the tank pressures are low enough that the regulator valves can be closed, as per lines 7 to 10 in the left-hand column of 1-1.
104:44:23||alsj|Because of the problems experienced with the high-gain S-band <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../sband.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">antenna</a> prior to the descent, it will not be used.  Use of the omnis will also conserve electrical power.  The landing delay cost about 200 ampere-hours of power out of a total of 2025 ampere-hours available from the Descent Stage batteries.  According to the Mission Report, conservation measures cut usage during the stay by about 100 ampere-hours, cutting the shortfall in half.
104:44:23||alsj|There are five batteries in the Descent Stage, each with a capacity of about 400 ampere-hours.  These are batteries 1,2,3,4, and L.  The fifth battery - sometimes called the Lunar Battery or the Luny Battery - was a feature added for the J-missions so that the crews could stay on the lunar surface for 72 hours.  There were two electrical control assemblies (ECAs) on the LM, one controlled from each side of the spacecraft, with which all of the batteries could be operated and controlled.  These ECAs were labeled CDR and LMP.  Here, Bat L is being routed through the CDR ECA.
104:44:23||alsj|A talkback is an indicator in a small window which shows the status of the appropriate system.  Most of the LM <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#TalkBack" target="new" target="alsj">talkbacks</a> showed either a gray window or a striped &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#Barber_Pole" target="new" target="alsj">barber pole</a>&quot; pattern.  In the case of Battery L,  the talkback shows &quot;CDR&quot; when the battery was connected to the CDR ECA, &quot;LMP&quot; when connected to the LMP ECA, or the barberpole when disconnected.  The printed checklist reads &quot;Bat L (LMP) - ON; tb - LMP&quot; and both instances of &quot;LMP&quot; are changed to &quot;CDR&quot;.  As Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien points out, the primary indicator of the system configuration is not the switch position but the talkback.
104:45:00||alsj|They will conserve power be turning off the S-band antenna, the Mission timer, etc.
104:46:10||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-4_5.jpg"  title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Page 1-4</a> shows the circuit breakers on Panel 11, which is on the wall at John's left shoulder.  Page 1-5 shows panel 16, which is on the wall at Charlie's right shoulder.
104:46:42||alsj|The inverters generate AC current from the battery current.  The circuit breaker for Inverter 1, which is on John's panel, is also Open.  Charlie is making sure that Houston has thought this through.
104:46:46||alsj|With the AC power off, they will not have a functioning mission timer.
104:47:40||alsj|These are the procedures on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/surface16.html" target="new" target="alsj">surface checklist</a> pages 1-1 to 1-9 and include star sighting with the Alignment Optical Telescope ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../aot.htm" target="new" target="alsj">AOT</a>) used to do an alignment of the inertial platform.
104:47:40||alsj|Because the spacecraft is sitting upright on the surface with little yaw, John and Charlie should be able to use the stars indicated in the checklist, for example, the bright star Altair in the middle of the left-hand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-2_3.jpg"  title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-2</a>.
104:47:40|Jones|alsj|The only thing that would force you to use different stars in the platform alignment would be the spacecraft attitude.
104:47:40|Duke|alsj|That's right.  You know, if we had landed kattiwampus, we'd have had to pick some new stars, probably.
104:47:40||alsj|Here, Charlie uses the American slang term &quot;kattiwampus&quot; to mean a significant departure from vertical LM orientation.  More generally, I understand it to mean &quot;out of kilter&quot; or, in NASA-ese, &quot;seriously off-nominal&quot;
104:47:40||alsj|Journal Contributor Larry McGlynn has provided a high-resolution scan of the star chart and accompanying star list flown on Apollo 16 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/Apollo16StarChartandStarList.JPG" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.5 Mb</a> ).
104:47:40|Jones|alsj|And you are going to do a platform alignment?  You're looking to make sure that the guidance system knows how the spacecraft is aligned on the lunar surface relative to the local vertical; and you're not trying to determine where the LM is.
104:47:40|Duke|alsj|That's right.
104:47:40|Jones|alsj|Houston could get the 'where' from the tracking data.
104:47:40|Duke|alsj|That's right.  There was no way, on board, to tell 'where'.  These alignment programs were strictly to get the platform lined up so that we knew where local vertical was.  We had a REFSMMAT (Reference to Stable Member Matrix) and we knew we had a certain attitude on the eight ball that we had to be in so we could fly and abort.  And it was to make sure the thing hadn't drifted away.
104:47:40|Jones|alsj|Can you give me a definition of REFSMMAT?
104:47:40|Duke|alsj|Reference Matrix.  They had a series of different ones for each mission, and they were selected to give the pilot something reasonable to look at during a critical maneuver.  For instance, on the lunar surface you wanted to start with the eight ball at zero-zero-zero - zero pitch, zero yaw, zero roll.  Okay?  So when you flew in, you were referencing to that eight ball.  You didn't want a REFSMMAT that would put the eight ball at like 90-degree roll and 10-degree yaw and 14-degree pitch, you see.  I mean, how can you fly that?  So these Reference Matrixes were series of numbers that were put into the computer that the IMU knew how to align itself so that the eight ball attitude was something reasonable.
104:47:40||alsj|David Woods adds: &quot;It is important to realise that the  Apollo spacecraft (both CM and LM) could go into gimbal lock at any time during a mission due to the fact that the gimbal mountings for the guidance platform only had three degrees of freedom. Therefore, during mission planning, it was necessary to understand what attitudes needed to be adopted by the spacecraft at every stage of the flight. Then they could ensure that the alignment of the guidance platform with respect to the stars would always be set so that gimbal lock would not be entered. The numbers that defined the alignment of the platform were referred to as a REFSMMAT - basically a set of angles with respect to the stars. Apollo 8 used three different REFSMMATs and the later J-missions used upwards of eight REFSMMATs. It was to accommodate all the various attitudes that a mission would require to achieve its goal.&quot;]
104:47:40|Jones|alsj|Landmark tracking had long since gone away, prior to PDI?  I know the 11 and 12 guys did some landmark tracking...
104:47:40|Duke|alsj|We didn't do it any.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD6082_LandmarkTrackingAp8-10-11-12_1971002567.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">I remember that was only from the Command Module</a>.
104:47:40|Jones|alsj|The early LM crews did some.
104:47:40|Duke|alsj|They did?  Well, we didn't do any.  It had gone.
104:47:40||alsj|The change from earlier missions was probably due to the fact that, on Apollo 11 and 12, the LM crew undocked from the Command Module while both spacecraft were in a 60-mile circular orbit and then used the LM engines to enter the 60-by-9 mile Descent Orbit.  They then had to use landmark tracking to make sure they were in the proper orbit before they started the final descent.  Starting with Apollo 14, the Command Module Engine was used to put both spacecraft into the Descent Orbit and landmark tracking was done from the Command Module before the landing crew entered the LM.
104:51:41|Jones|alsj|On page 1-2, it looks you do a gravity alignment first.
104:51:41|Duke|alsj|P57 was the platform alignment.  And there was a gravity align.  I don't know how it sensed gravity, but there was a gravity align deal and then you sighted on the stars.
104:51:41|Jones|alsj|And gravity would only give you the vertical axis, whereas the stars would give you all three.
104:51:41|Duke|alsj|That's right.
104:52:08||alsj|John is quoting the first line of the 1964 Beatles song, &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, from the film of the same name.
104:52:10||alsj|There are two plausible completions to John's statement at 104:52:04. That they'd like to (1) do the EVA or (2) get some sleep. Arguments can be made for either, as indicated in the crew comments that come next.
104:52:58|Duke|alsj|As a hindsight observation, it wasn't a good idea.  I think we should have gotten out first.  But, at the time, everybody thought it was a good idea.  And John maybe still thinks it was a good idea; but I didn't, because I had a tough time getting to sleep.  You know, my mind was just racing and I wanted to get out.  I was thinking about all that was coming up; and the excitement had just passed; and, you know, my mind was just whirling.  I think we had so much adrenaline pumping we could have gone, probably two days - forty-eight hours - without any problem.  So, looking back, I think we made a mistake.  But it's done.
104:53:48||alsj|Blank spaces for these two values are available in the righthand column at the bottom of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-1</a>, but Charlie didn't write them there.
104:54:42||alsj|They have been venting pressure in both the oxygen and fuel tanks in the Descent Stage.
104:54:42|Jones|alsj|What does 'vent's barber pole' mean?
104:54:42|Duke|alsj|It means it's closed.  You had an open position and a closed position.  When you hit it open, it was a clear indication; and, when it's closed it shows a striped pattern, like a barberpole.
104:54:42|Jones|alsj|So there's a window there and, when the valve was open the window's clear and, when the valve's closed, the stripy pattern comes into view.
104:54:42|Duke|alsj|That's right.  And the stripy one we called barber pole.  See, here's the flag.  And we're looking at DPS Schematic in the LM System Data Book, SKB32100126-385.  Drawing 11.1.
104:56:26||alsj|Jim and Charlie were both Air Force pilots, while John was a Naval Aviator.]</i></blockquote>
104:58:43||alsj|John is doing the star sightings.  They have raised the bottom-mounted shades on the windows to darken the cabin.
104:59:48||alsj|Charlie and I looked at the data card book, which he brought back from the Moon.
104:59:48|Jones|alsj|The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16DataCard-bckcvr.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">back of the Data Card Book</a> does, in fact, have some scribbling on it.  I notice that some of it's in ballpoint and some of it's in pencil.  You had both?
104:59:48|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
104:59:48||alsj|Charlie wrote the new time, 105:10, on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16DataCard-bckcvr.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">back of the Data Card Book</a>.  In the following sequence, he wrote some of the changes there and some on the indicated pages of the Surface Checklist.</blockquote>
105:02:38||alsj|In the following, John has reached the bottom of the left-hand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-2_3.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-2</a> and asking Houston if they want the computer to use the values.  The &quot;angle&quot; difference is the change in platform orientation implied by the observations.]</i></blockquote>
105:03:38||alsj|These are the OG (Outer Gimbal), IG (Inner Gimbal), and MG (Middle Gimbal) numbers in the left column of 1-3.  Charlie does not write the numbers in the spaces provided on page 1-3 but, rather, on Page 6 in the LM Data Card Book.  These angles are the components of Noun 20 (N20) at the upper left on that page.  In the following, Charlie reads out some <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7990LM_AGS.html" target="new" target="alsj">AGS</a> data as per the right-hand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-2_3.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-2</a>.
105:04:43||alsj|They will now transmit the contents of the computer memory to Houston.]</i></blockquote>
105:09:03|Duke|alsj|What John's saying here with 'Do you really want to do this, Houston?' is that we were going to lose our platform.  We were going to power down the guidance and navigation system; and this parking it - or powering it down - put it into gimbal lock.  It just took all the three axis-gyros and aligned them all, so it put them into gimbal lock.  And, when you're in gimbal lock, you usually lose your attitude and it was sort of always a creeping fear in the back of your mind that: 'man, why do I want to put this thing into gimbal lock?  Suppose it doesn't come out.'  So that's what John was getting at.  'You really want to do this Houston!?'  That was the mode he said it in.  'Yeah, go ahead'  And, when we did the procedure (laughing), it did it!  It really worked.
105:09:03|Duke|tech|I highly recommend the procedure that we used for parking that platform in gimbal lock.  We parked that beauty for 71 hours, and we didn't even had a PIPA (Pulsed Integrating Pendulous Accelerometer) bias or gyro update (when they powered it up for launch).  It just worked like a champ.
105:09:03|Jones|alsj|And then down here a couple of lines at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1050909" target="new" target="alsj">105:09:09</a>, you said, 'that's a sad feeling, Jim, to watch that thing go over'&quot;]
105:09:03|Duke|alsj|It looks like it's just dying (Charlie makes a falling-airplane noise), you know, going into gimbal lock.
105:09:03||alsj|Interested readers can find a discussion of gimbal lock in the Apollo 11 transcript at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a11/a11.postland.html# 1045935" target="new" target="alsj">104:59:35</a>.]</i></blockquote>
105:10:06||alsj|The first three pre-planned opportunities to launch were T-1, 2, and 3.  The rest are numbered according to Command Module orbits.  Charlie will copy these times into a pre-printed table on page 6 in the LM Data Card Book.
105:10:06|Jones|alsj|It's true, isn't it, that you could have launched almost any time and Ken could have come to get you.
105:10:06|Duke|alsj|Yeah, it would have been a long rendezvous.  We practiced that some time - you know, an any time lift-off.  I've forgotten the maximum rendezvous time, but it could have been a day (24 hours) to get it all done right.  So, you didn't want to do that if you didn't have to.
105:10:53|Young|tech|The trouble with pulling the mission timer (as Houston had them do at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1044550" target="new" target="alsj">104:45:50</a>) is you lose a clock, and that makes the emergency lift-off times absolutely meaningless.  You don't have any idea what time it is.  We kept getting a block (of lift-off times) and I didn't know what to do with them.  I didn't know what time it was.&quot;]
105:10:53|Duke|tech|We had no idea what GET (Ground Elapsed Time) was, but we had a Houston watch.  They ought to read them (meaning the lift-off times) to you in Houston time; then you can use your wristwatch.
105:10:53|Young|tech|What you would do in the real world if you had to do an emergency lift-off at one of those times - (and) you had contact with the ground - you would roughly use that (Houston) time to get you powered up on time and have the ground count you down to the second for lift-off.
105:10:53|Duke|tech|But these are no-comm (lift-off) times.
105:10:53|Young|tech|That's correct.
105:10:53|Duke|tech|Then, they were worthless.&quot;]
105:10:53|Young|tech|It seems to me, if you lose your timer, you aren't going to hit it on the second.  You may hit it on the minute (by using the wristwatch and Houston times).
105:10:53|Duke|tech|You're right.
105:13:01||alsj|The preceding exchange indicates both that Charlie is very knowledgeable about the LM systems and that he has been thinking about systems they don't really need in order to conserve power.
105:15:24||alsj|The crater may the one just below the local horizon on the left side of AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18307" target="new" target="alsj">18307</a>.] </i></blockquote>
105:15:45||alsj|Here, Charlie is speculating that they may have some trouble with buried blocks during the drilling and trenching tasks they are planning to do during the EVAs.
105:19:20||alsj|The Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly is a storage unit that is folded against the side of the Descent Stage under Charlie's window.  The MESA is hinged at the bottom and, when John gets out at the start of the first EVA, he will release a latch at the top of the MESA so that it will rotate down into easy reach.
105:19:20|Jones|alsj|Why are you heating the MESA?
105:19:20|Duke|alsj|We had food down there.  We had the TV camera down there.  We had some film down there.  We had the rock boxes.  And they didn't want it  to cold soak.  I don't remember what was critical down there.
105:19:20||alsj|Readers should note that, during the trip out from Earth, the CSM/LM combination was slowly rotated to provide uniform heating.  Now that the LM is down on the surface, the MESA is in shadow and, therefore, would cool rapidly if not heated.  Once John and Charlie get out on the surface and open the MESA, the rising Sun will provide heat.
105:19:20|Jones|alsj|Were there more or less acronyms when you transferred over from the Air Force to NASA.
105:19:20|Duke|alsj|More in NASA.
105:19:20||alsj|In Houston, the NASA Public Affairs Commentator mentions that Flight Director Gerry Griffin's crew is going off shift and Flight Director Pete Frank's crew is coming on.
105:22:29||alsj|Charlie is asking about the step seven lines up from the bottom of the right-hand column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-6_7.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-7</a>.  At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1052332" target="new" target="alsj">105:23:32</a> he repeats his statement and we learn that he was saying "It's in Off/Reset".  My thanks to Frank O'Brien for pointing this out.
105:22:57||alsj|The Power Amplifier, Off step is ten lines up from the bottom of the right-hand column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-6_7.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-7</a>.
105:23:42||alsj|Astronaut Tony England takes over as CapCom.  As he confirmed in a January 2006 e-mail, he was Mission Scientist on Apollo 13 and was scheduled to serve as CapCom during the EVAs and during the sleep shifts during the trips to and from the Moon during that mission.  John and Charlie were on the Apollo 13 backup crew and, having gotten to know Tony's capablilities, asked him to serve as EVA CapCom on Apollo 16.
105:23:42||alsj|Charlie's initial conversation with Tony indicates that he and John have reached the top of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-8_9.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-9</a>.
105:28:19||alsj|Launch from Earth occurred at 11:54 a.m. Central Standard Time (17:54 GMT) on April 16, 1972.  In Houston, it is now 9:22 p.m. CST on April 20.
105:28:19||alsj|Hamish Lindsay notes that the fact that Standard Time - rather than Daylight Saving Time - was in force in mid-April may puzzle some readers.  The following is adapted from http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/index.html .
105:28:19||alsj|The earliest suggestion of the concept of Daylight Saving was Benjamin Franklin's in a 1784 letter to the editor of the Journal of Paris, written while Franklin was the American emissary in France.  In 1907, London builder William Willett began a vigorous campaign to persuade the British government to introduce a daylight savings scheme but failed, largely because of the understandable opposition of agricultural interests.  During World War I, a number of countries adopted various forms of Daylight Saving because of the need to conserve fuel supplies .  Germany was the first to do so, moving its clocks ahead one hour at 11 p.m. on 30 April 1916.  The United States first adopted Daylight Savings in 1918, moving clocks ahead one hour on 31 March.  However, after the war, popular opposition quickly led to repeal in 1919.  Some states and localities continued to observe Daylight Saving Time, particularly in the northeast. The places that observed Daylight Saving Time did not all start it on the same day of the year nor end it on the same day.
105:28:19||alsj|As the US economy became increasingly interconnected, particularly after World War II, the patchwork pattern of adoption began to cause noticeable problems and, in 1966, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act so that Daylight Saving would begin on the last Sunday of April and to end on the last Sunday of October.  An entire state could continue to observe Standard Time year 'round, with Arizona and Indiana choosing to do so. The law was amended in 1986 to move the start date to the first Sunday in April but left the last end date to the last Sunday in October.  Because Apollo 16 flew during April 1966, both Florida and Texas were observing Standard Time.
105:30:15|Duke|alsj|John Covington was the engineer responsible for our cabin configuration checklists and donning and doffing the suits; and what I was referring to there was the (LMP) PLSS that was stowed (on the floor) between us.  I was moving it; and I picked it up and it was a piece of cake compared to the light-weight training unit.  It was a lot easier.
105:30:15|Jones|alsj|Was your PLSS on the floor by the hatch?  And John's was on the wall?
105:30:15|Duke|alsj|Yeah, I believe so.  I don't remember.
105:30:15|Jones|alsj|When you look at the PLSS is the pictures, there are what look like strips of Velcro on the back and, in John's case, I imagine that was to help hold it on the wall.  Was the back side of yours down as well?
105:30:15||alsj|As of December 2007, the ALSJ editors know that the Velcro on the back of both PLSS was not used for mounting the PLSSs anywhere but have not learned what purpose the Velcro was intended to serve.  In 2009, Ken Thomas as able to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PLSSVelcro.html" target="new" target="alsj">shed some light on the subject</a>.
105:30:15|Duke|alsj|No, it was up.  We had some pins and things in the floor, I remember; and a frame that it fit into.
105:30:15|Jones|alsj|And you took that frame up at this point.  That means you must be through with the switch configurations.
105:30:15|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we're on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-8_9.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-9</a>.
105:30:15|Jones|alsj|Okay.  (Reading) 'Stow arm rests.  Stow <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../coas.htm" target="new" target="alsj">COAS</a>?'  What was the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#coas" target="new" target="alsj">COAS</a> (Crewman Optical Alignment Sight)?
105:30:15|Duke|alsj|That is an optical sight that John would use (during rendezvous).  You could move it...And you could put it in the window; and it was a boresight, really.  You could use it to rendezvous on and get relative motion.  Or, you could put it in the overhead window and you could use it to dock with (the CSM).
105:43:02|Jones|alsj|Does Tony's statement imply that he went through some of these LM activities at some point in the training cycle?
105:43:02|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  He did that.  Not with us; but he would practice so that he knew what it was like to doff and suit and to do all the activities, so that he could be familiar with it.
105:43:02|Jones|alsj|Let's see, the support crew was assigned at the same time you were, so you worked with them through the whole training cycle.
105:43:02|Duke|alsj|Yeah, mostly.  I don't remember who they were. Tony might have been support, plus he was CapCom.  Since he was sort of a geophysicist or whatever he was, he went on the geology trips with us.
105:43:02||alsj|The Apollo 16 support crew members were Don Peterson,  Tony England, Phil Chapman, and Hank Hartsfield.  In addition to his service as EVA CapCom, Tony was also the Mission Scientist.
105:43:02|Jones|alsj|Did you and John have a hand in picking who the support people were?
105:43:02|Duke|alsj|John might have; I didn't.
105:43:02||alsj|In 1996, I wrote to Tony England.  &quot;I gather that, during training, you spent time in one or more of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">LM simulators</a> or mock-ups running through the procedures so that you would have first-hand knowledge of what was going on.  Is this right?  If so, did you have another member of the support crew in there with you?  What other parts of the training do you go through?  Any comments you have will be appreciated because I think it is important to know how you prepared for your part of the mission.&quot;
105:43:02|England|alsj|The memory is getting a little fuzzy.  I was always with the prime crew when they did their walk-throughs and lunar surface sims; I also performed all of the lunar surface procedures with just a trainer - including being suited during many of them.  I remember doing all the EVA sims several times while suited.  These were out on a simulated lunar surface behind the training building at KSC (Kennedy Space Center, Florida).  I don't remember who played which role - we may have alternated because we wanted to experience both roles (CDR and LMP) - and I don't remember who my partner was.  I believe we also used the training Rover around the jogging trail back there.  I did these things because I thought it was important for me to know exactly what the crew was doing so that I could understand any problems they might be having.  Also, the Backup crew (Haise, Roosa, and Mitchell), who knew that there wasn't another Apollo mission for them and, in the case of Mitchell and Roosa, already had flight experience, would sometimes allow me to substitute for the LM pilot (Mitchell), probably, in some of the less important exercises - (although) never for integrated sims.  The comment about the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jettison bag</a> referred to there being a lot of junk to get rid of and the bag being so large when it was full that there wasn't room to swing the hatch in.  Unlike the CSM hatch, the LM hatch swung inward.
105:43:02||alsj|&quot;I was the youngest astronaut and, I realized, not very experienced.  I was trying to get as much experience as I could to try to avoid screwing something up on the mission.  John, Charlie, and Ken - and everyone else associated with the mission for that matter - were so dedicated to assuring mission success, achieving good science, and aware that Apollo was ending, that we wanted to do the absolute best that we could.  That was why I accepted doing the pad closeout - there was a name for that position but I can't remember what it was - as well as all the surface EVAs.  In retrospect, I tried to do too much and would have been wiser had I skipped the closeout.  But closeout stimulated emotions that I will never forget - both the grand ones associated with helping them get on their way, and the dismal one of feeling left behind as I tucked them in and watched them go.&quot;
105:43:35||alsj|Contrary to the impression that Tony gives, the only items being stowed in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jettison bag</a> at this point are three armrests:  John's left-hand armrest and both of Charlie's.  Additional items will be put in the jettison bag during the EVA Prep which, because of the landing delay, won't be done until after the first rest period.  Nonetheless, removal of the armrests probably makes the cabin seem larger.
105:44:42|Jones|alsj|Was the 500-mm lens on a separate camera?
105:44:42|Duke|alsj|It wasn't a separate camera.  It was a separate lens.  We'd just attach the lens to the Hasselblad.
105:44:42|Jones|alsj|Did you have three Hasselblads out on the surface, one for each of you and one for the 500?
105:44:42|Duke|alsj|We might have.  You're right; we had a separate...Gosh, now you've got me thinking.
105:44:42|Jones|alsj|I can't imagine trying to change that lens once you get outside with all that dirt.&quot;]
105:44:42|Duke|alsj|I don't remember.  What did they have on 17?  'Cause we had the same thing that they had.
105:44:42|Jones|alsj|They had a third camera body, stowed under the Rover seat; but it took us a long time to figure that out.
105:44:42|Duke|alsj|Well, that's what we had.  Oh!  I remember, because it didn't have a trigger on it.  Yeah, it was a separate lens and a camera body and I had to hold it up like this (see below) and click it.  I had to click the button.  I practiced holding it like this.
105:44:42|Jones|alsj|And what you were showing me was that you had your left arm forward, cradling the lens in your palm...
105:44:42|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  I forgot which hand was forward.  But, if I remember, it was probably like this because the little button was on the left.  The lens would rest in my left hand and then the camera body would rest in the palm of my right hand...
105:44:42|Jones|alsj|And you could use your index finger to trigger it.  I don't know if we ever see you use the 500 in the TV, but we'll watch for it.
105:44:42|Duke|alsj|I don't think so.
105:53:41|Duke|tech|It's a piece of cake getting out of those suits.  It sure fills up the cockpit; they seem to be fatter than all those old training suits.  We stowed them back on the engine cover, but we still had enough room to do everything.
105:53:41||alsj|A composite image (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17stitch20522-25eh.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.5 Mb</a>) made by Ed Hengeveld from Apollo 17 post-EVA photos AS17-134-20522 and 25, giving a wide view from the LMP's station.
105:55:31||alsj|They had planned to spend 30 minutes doffing the suits.  John got out of his in only 10 minutes, in part because the suit is clean and the urine bags were only partly full.
105:57:20||alsj|This step is at the bottom of the right column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 3-4</a>.
105:58:54||alsj|The ECS contains two centrifugal water separators which remove excess water from the oxygen stream.  As per the instruction near the middle of the left column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-8_9.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-8</a>, they are currently using Separator number 1.
106:05:34||alsj|After John took his suit off, he stowed the LM hoses in attachments on the wall. Note that, on checklist <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 3-4</a>, near the bottom of the right column, they had the option of drying the suit out or stowing the hoses as per &quot;Configure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a> for Sleep&quot; on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf3-6_7.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 3-4</a>.  Because they have not done an EVA yet and the suits are dry, John mounted the hoses on the wall.  See the discussion at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1062233" target="new" target="alsj">106:22:33</a>.  The blue hose carries the oxygen stream coming out of the ECS while the red hose carries the return flow.
106:06:32||alsj|It has also taken Charlie about ten minutes to get out of his suit.
106:11:50||alsj|According to the Mission Report, the problem was ultimately traced to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return Valve</a>, which allows gas to flow from the cabin back into the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a>.  Apparently, the valve was not functioning properly in the Auto position, probably because of contamination in the valve mechanism.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-38.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-38</a> from the Mission Report shows the flow paths and subsystem locations in the ECS/Cabin/Suit system.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-39.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-39</a> shows details of the Cabin Gas Return Valve operation.  They will return to the problem at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.window.html#1064811" target="new" target="alsj">106:48:11</a>.
106:12:32|Jones|alsj|I take it that 500 was well padded?
106:12:32|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  If I remember, the stowage configuration for this thing was like the Rock of Gibraltar.  They were concerned that, if we hit hard and it rattled, it would break it.
106:15:45||alsj|After undocking from the Command Module, John and Charlie took photos AS16-113-18279 to 18295 on Hasselblad magazine A, also listed in the catalogs as AS16-113. Here, they have taken photographs out the LM windows.  John took <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18296" target="new" target="alsj">18296</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18303" target="new" target="alsj">18303</a> out the left window and Charlie took <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18304" target="new" target="alsj">18304</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18310" target="new" target="alsj">18310</a> out the right window.  Dave Byrne has assembled a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-18296-310.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">composite</a>.]</i></blockquote>
106:16:12||alsj|The Rover was designed to handle slopes of up to 26 degrees.  They will drive to the vicinity of five small craters named the Cincos (Spanish for &quot;Fives&quot;), for their first stop on EVA-2.
106:19:03||alsj|They will find these black-and-white breccias at many of their geology stops.  These blocks were probably ejecta from South Ray Crater.  Charlie comments on them again at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.window.html#1070528" target="new" target="alsj">107:05:28</a>.]</i></blockquote>
106:19:13||alsj|Secondary craters are formed in the low-velocity impacts of ejecta from high-velocity, primary impacts.  If the secondary impact is relatively oblique, it will gouge an elongated crater which will show the direction of flight of the ejecta fragment.
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|I take it that you're talking about some practice craters...&quot;]
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Behind the Mission Support Operations Building (at the Cape).  Behind the Crew Training Building they had sort of a flat plain and there's where we played with our experiments - we put out the experiments. And then we'd get in the Rover and we'd drive back through the swamp.  They had this road they'd cut through the palmettos and the marsh, and you'd drive along for a while and you'd get to a spot and it would sort of be a wide area and they'd have some clinkers or clunkers - you know, blocks of rock scattered around - and a simulated crater.  So, you'd jump off the Rover and turn on the camera and do your experiments; you know, sample-taking and picture-taking and try to describe it to 'em.  And a couple of those things they'd dug out with a bulldozer.  Of course, with a bulldozer, you couldn't make it a round crater.&quot;]
106:19:13||alsj|&quot;It looked like this rock that hit, if I remember, it hit and skidded around so the crater wasn't perfectly round.&quot;]
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|Deepest at the place where it hit?
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|No.  It was shallowest (where it hit) and then got deeper.&quot;]
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|Burrowed in.
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|Two other questions.  The way Jack and Gene described it is that the exercises at the Cape were more operationally oriented; and, when you'd go out with the Rover and the backpacks to  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj_sunsetcrtr.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Sunset</a> (Crater National Monument,  Arizona) and other places, it was more geologically oriented.&quot;]
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah, that's correct.  There wasn't any real geology at the Cape, you know; it was just...The Cape training was to learn the procedures of the ALSEP package and also to learn the techniques that you would use to operate the equipment.  So it was techniques exercises, rather than geological.  But, on the other hand, when you'd go out to Sunset or Jackass Flats (at the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj.ntsnews.html" target="new" target="alsj">Nevada Test Site</a>) or Hawaii or wherever you were, and those would be geological in nature.  You were really looking at some good geology and you were trying to figure out what happened.&quot;]
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|And you just triggered another question.  On the crater names, did you and John do a lot of that?&quot;]
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we picked them.  We sat down with Muehlberger and some of the other guys and I remember we picked most of them.
106:19:13|Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail|alsj|Crater naming was always a project in which we wanted the astronaut crew to be the primary source for the names. Thus Charlie (always the prime 'mouthpiece'), John Young and Tony England (CapCom) were the ones we tried to get to name the craters. As you can tell, it is a mixture of crew background and some that I no longer have a clue either as to where the name came from. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Spook</a> is Tony England's nickname for his wife. Buster (I think) was their dog. The rest I can be of no help.
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|Palmetto and Gator are reminiscent of...
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|Palmetto is my home state, South Carolina.  And Gator was Florida for John.  Lone Star was for the Lone Star state, Texas.  And we had a Cat Crater...We were told we couldn't name them after our kids?  Or our family.  We couldn't name them after people.  We had a  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623nlbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Dot Crater</a> which was for Dotty; and then I had a Cat Crater which was (Duke sons) Charles and Tom.  John had one for Susie which I think was Spook.  (Charlie is mistaken.  See Muehlberger's comment above.)  And then  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Stone Mountain</a>, we picked that 'cause it looked like Stone Mountain in Georgia.  And then, from the photographs, to the north, there was the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16_lpi_trvrsmap.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Smokies</a> were on beyond North Ray Crater and we picked 'Smokies' because, from the photographs it had this sort of bluish (cast)...It looked like the atmosphere in the (Great) Smoky Mountains (on the border between Tennessee and North Carolina).  And then we had North Ray (Crater) and South Ray (Crater) which were self-explanatory (being surrounded by prominent rays of ejecta).  And there was a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Double Spot</a>.  Now, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Cincos</a> (meaning the "fives") were the five little craters up on the side of Stone Mountain.  (During pre-flight geology planning) they said, 'well, we want to go there' and well, we needed a name for it, so we sat around and thought up these names.&quot;]
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|There's a Commission of the International Astronomical Union that claims authority for approving names.  And they had some rules about no-nos, like living people.  So, was somebody paying attention to those rules?&quot;]
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  By the time they got around to us (meaning Apollo 16), those guys were really protecting their turf.  You know: 'We have the real authority to name those craters.'  And our attitude was: (chuckling) 'You know what you can do with your authority!'  We tried to abide by the rules, which is why we sort of camouflage it.  And I don't believe they were ever officially given those names or not.  I know that, for our training, we certainly used them.  But whether that society ever put those names on an official map, I don't know.
106:19:13||alsj|The following is an editorial comment.
106:19:13||alsj|My attitude is that, as long as the Moon was being explored telescopically, approval of feature names properly belonged to the International Astronomical Union.  However, once the Apollo crews landed, it became their prerogative to choose names for previously unnamed features at their landing sites and along the Command Module ground tracks.
106:19:13||alsj|We return, now, to my conversation with Charlie.
106:19:13|<a name="1061922B">Jones</a>|alsj|Did you train at Sunset Crater near Flagstaff?  That's the pretty cinder cone volcano with basalt flows around it.
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we did; and we went to Meteor Crater (an impact feature near Holbrook, Arizona).  We did a traverse up to the rim and then around the rim.  Which simulated a Moon crater.
106:19:13|Jones|alsj|Did you do a similar thing at Sedan Crater at the NTS (Nevada Test Site)?
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  I've forgotten exactly what craters we visited out there (at NTS), but we did similar things.
106:19:13||alsj|Sedan Crater is 320 feet (98 meters) deep and 1280 feet (390 meters) across and was created on July 6, 1962 by the explosion of a nuclear explosive buried 635 feet (194 meters) below the surface in desert alluvium.  The accompanying U.S. Department of Energy photographs are an aerial view ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../sedan_aerial.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">202k</a> ) and a view from the rim ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../sedan_rim.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">188k</a> ).  Several of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj.ntsnews.html" target="new" target="alsj">crews visited the Nevada Test Site</a> to study craters like Sedan.]
106:19:13|Duke|alsj|And then we did Sunset Crater (and) I think it was more just understanding volcanics.  We did traverses but it was, you know, looking at outcrops and sampling at various stops around the place.  We did two trips, I think, to Flagstaff.  And it was on one of those trips we went out to Meteor Crater and spent a day or two.  We'd been out to Meteor Crater earlier (long before Charlie's assignment to the Apollo 13 backup crew) with sort of a gaggle of guys; but that was just basic geology and we walked down to the bottom of the crater.  When we were actually training for Apollo, we made it realistic.  We knew we could never get down into a crater like that on the Moon, so we didn't do it in our training, simulating an actual EVA.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
106:20:08|Jones|alsj|John's comment here suggests that, on some of your geology exercises, they'd dump you out with a map but didn't tell you exactly where you were.&quot;]
106:20:08|Duke|alsj|That's right.  Just to help us with map reading and figuring out how to adjust traverses.  And that would give us training, and it would give the Backroom training.  They'd put us out close, but they'd make it so we had to figure out where we were.  And that was good training.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
106:22:19||alsj|Here, Tony is asking if the blue suit hose was attached to the blue wall mount and similar for the red hose.
106:25:43|Duke|alsj|Since we were powered down (to conserve LM battery power in the aftermath of the late landing), we weren't going to do that (meaning watch John's initial descent to the surface, the Rover deployment, etc.).  We were going to wait until we got it (meaning the TV and the LCRU) on to the Rover before we would have the TV.
106:25:43||alsj|See Tony England's transmission at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1wake.html#1161501" target="new" target="alsj">116:15:01</a> for a full explanation of Houston's reasons for deleting use of the TV prior to the time John and Charlie mount it on the Rover.
106:28:34|Jones|alsj|Did you do much training for walking traverses?&quot;]
106:28:34|Duke|alsj|No.
106:28:34|Jones|alsj|Just talked about it?
106:28:34|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
106:40:32|Duke|tech|We had a few changes because of landing six hours late.  They had us power down the AC bus and also the LGC DSKY breaker to save power, and all that worked just great.  I thought those procedures came up in good shape.  We just floated right through the checklist for those changes and then we were right on.
106:40:36||alsj|Charlie wants to try his hand at a description of the scene out his window.
106:40:36|Jones|alsj|Would you do this sort of thing when you went out on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.html" target="new" target="alsj">field trips</a> to Hawaii or wherever?
106:40:36|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  They'd start us out (as if we were) in the Lunar Module; and we'd sit there and just describe what we could see from about 12 o'clock around to 3 o'clock.  And we'd describe everything:  the size of the rocks, the terrain, if we could see any bedrock, you know, what kind of ridges, the shape of the mountains, those kind of things.
106:40:36|Jones|alsj|When you say 'start out in the Lunar Module'...
106:40:36|Duke|alsj|Well, we wouldn't have a Lunar Module, of course.  You just have...'Okay, this is where you landed, you guys.'  And we'd...I can't remember whether we got up on the back of a truck or what we did, but it would give us a little elevation, you see.  And we'd just start describing what we could see out of the window, looking to the west or whatever.  Yeah, it was pretty good training.
106:40:36||alsj|John Pfannerstill has scanned portions of Apollo 16 Pan Camera frame 4623 showing the area <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-c.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">around the LM</a>, the area  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-n.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">north</a> to North Ray Crater, and the area <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">south</a> to Stone Mountain.]</i></blockquote>
106:41:04|Duke|alsj|I look back now and I think we probably missed the distances.  It's very difficult to judge distances up there and the sizes of objects (are difficult to judge).  You're looking at things you've never seen before and, so, the only thing you can do is comparative references and what could be big, far away, looks very much like something that's smaller close-in.  I mean, we made a gross mistake up at North Ray Crater about a big block (House Rock) that was off to the north of us; and, man, we just kept running and running and running to get to that thing and it turned out to be humongous!  That just really floored us.  And that brought home to me how difficult it was to judge distances and sizes of objects you'd never seen before.
106:41:04||alsj|Readers should note that House Rock is so large that it is visible in pre-flight traverse map &quot;Descartes EVA-I, III 2 of 2&quot; ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.1 Mb</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.6 Mb</a> ) at CZ.2/80.6 in the gap between the bottom of the &quot;1&quot; and the &quot;2&quot;.  It is visible as a dot that is white on the east and black on the west.  It is even more apparent in the more detailed map &quot;Descartes EVA-III 3 of 3&quot; ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.3 Mb</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.6 Mb</a> ) just to the left of the printed &quot;12&quot;.  House Rock is also visible in Pan Camera frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-n.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4623</a> taken from the Service Module..  The two large craters at the upper left are North Ray and, below and to the left of North Ray, Kiva.  House Rock is on the southeastern rim of North Ray.
106:41:04|Duke|alsj|So, looking back on this description here, it might be half-accurate as far as distances go and the sizes of objects.  In fact, a thirty-meter crater is a big crater.  If you really think about it, I don't remember any thirty-meter craters out there.  That's over a hundred feet.
106:41:04|Jones|alsj|Very few people came even close in judging sizes and distances.
106:41:04||alsj|We then looked at Charlie's window pan, AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18304" target="new" target="alsj">18304</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18310" target="new" target="alsj">18310</a>.]
106:41:04|Duke|alsj|Now, this would be at 3 o'clock.  Probably one of the craters I was describing is this one right here.
106:41:04|Jones|alsj|In  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18307" target="new" target="alsj">18307</a>.&quot;] 
106:41:04|Duke|alsj|And, then, there's a crater here (just over the thrusters); and these little black dots are boulders; and this is probably the one - bright, with small blocks around it - I described as a 'bright, fresh crater.
106:41:04|Jones|alsj|That's a particularly blocky one which is to the left of the top of the thruster bell.
106:41:04|Duke|alsj|And you can see  (in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18308" target="new" target="alsj">18308</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18309" target="new" target="alsj">18309</a>), the twelve o'clock position, when we took these pictures, was very difficult to see because of the zero phase (that) blotted it out.&quot;]
106:41:04|Duke|alsj|I described a boulder with a fillet, here.  And I don't see...
106:41:04|Jones|alsj|They're hard to pick out in these relatively small prints.
106:41:04|Duke|alsj|It's partially buried, at about 2:30.  It should be just in front of the thruster.
106:45:05||alsj|As indicated on the &quot;Descartes EVA-I, III  1 of 3&quot; traverse map ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.0 Mb</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.6 Mb</a> ), Buster is a 90-m crater centered at CB.2/76.5.  See also, a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sitelm.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from the Pan Camera frame</a>.  The LM can be seen near the right edge of the picture area just above center.  North is up and the LM is in the bright area created by the engine exhaust on the west side of a small crater.  The large crater at bottom center of the picture area is Spook and the large crater at the upper left is Flag.  The diameter of Spook is about 350 meters.  Buster is the 100-m crater NNW of Spook and Halfway is the similar sized crater midway between Spook and Flag.
106:45:10||alsj|Spook is centered at about CA.0/77.0 and is about 400 meters across.
106:45:40|Jones|alsj|...I presume that Dogleg is at a place where a traverse changes direction?
106:45:40|Duke|alsj|I don't remember.  We'll have to look at the maps.  (Pause)  Yeah; Dogleg is here.
106:45:40|Jones|alsj|And that's at about CQ/86.  And that was on the dogleg back from the planned EVA-3 traverse.
106:45:40|Duke|alsj|Yeah, but we didn't stop there.
106:45:40|Jones|alsj|End Crater?
106:45:40|Duke|alsj|We named it End because that was the last stop (that is, Station 16).
106:45:40|Jones|alsj|Kiva (at CX/73).  It looks like it has a dome in the bottom...
106:45:40|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  It was a dome crater.  From the rim, you couldn't see the bottom of the crater.  I don't know why we named it Kiva.  Probably from one of the geology trips that we had.
106:45:40||alsj|In the pueblo cultures of the American Southwest, kivas are ceremonial chambers which, in many pre-historic communities, were large, cylindrical rooms dug into the ground, stone-lined, and roofed over.  Examples at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado and Chaco Canyon National Monument in New Mexico are 5 to 10 meters across, 2 to 4 meters deep, and show the work of skilled masons.
106:45:40|Jones|alsj|Plum and Flag?
106:45:40|Duke|alsj|Flag, I think, was part of Flagstaff (home of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Branch).  Halfway we picked because it was halfway from where we started.  I don't remember about WC or Phantom or any of those. (Pause) I think Phantom was because we really wasn't sure whether it was a crater or not.
106:45:40||alsj|In 1997, Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence speculated that WC might have been named in honor of comedian <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16_wcfields.html" target="new" target="alsj">W.C. Fields</a> because of Charlie's tendency to imitate his voice.  The other obvious possibility is the Victorian euphemism for toilet - namely &quot;Water Closet&quot;.  In response to an e-mail question, Tony England said,&quot;I remember WC well.  It was at a location toward the end of a traverse so that we were very likely to 'flush it'.  Sorry; but it was just a little toilet humor.&quot;  As can be seen on the EVA-2  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a>, there was no stop at WC included in the final traverse plans.  However, at the time the crater was named, a stop there may have be under discussion.]
106:45:40|Jones|alsj|Eden Valley?
106:45:40|Duke|alsj|I don't remember on that.
106:46:48||alsj|Here, Tony is asking about a bright ray from South Ray Crater that crosses the landing site and shows up on the &quot;Descartes EVA-I, III  2 of 2&quot; map as the whitish streaks running SW to NE around Spook and the Turtle Mountain area.  See, also, the larger scaled maps shown in Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp241.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.6.1-1</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.6.2-3</a> in the Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Procedures volume.
106:46:48||alsj|Readers should note that, although John was looking out the window from before pitchover until touchdown, he was looking for landmarks and potential hazards around the immediate landing area and, most importantly, was trying to gauge his altitude and motions relative to the ground.  On the occasions when Charlie looked out, he was looking at their planned traverse routes and for geologic features - such as rays - that were of interest in thinking about the traverses.  They were two different observers looking at the same scene for very different purposes.
106:47:41||alsj|The Volkswagen &quot;Beetle&quot; is about 1.5 meters high, 1.5 meters wide and 4.5 meters long.
106:48:05|Young|tech|The night before (the landing), we filled the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bags</a> full of orange juice in the CSM; and the next morning, prior to suit donning, we put them in the suit.  Every time we bent our head, the microphone would get caught in the drink bag and put some orange juice into the air in zero gravity, or would squirt the side of your face.  Charlie really got covered with it.  It really was an annoying problem.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|My valve was really bad.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Mine didn't work all the time, and I was really being careful.  I'm sure it got all over us because, once we got on the surface and looked up at the Lunar Module, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.trv1prep.html#1211930" target="new" target="alsj">Travano</a> cover had orange juice all over it.  It was in dots, less than 5 percent (coverage), but there was a lot of orange juice on the Travano cover.  I'm sure orange juice is something you don't want to float around on wire bundles.  I think we need something to stop up that hole (meaning the end of the straw) in zero gravity - and in one-sixth gravity until you are ready to use it.  Maybe a cap that fits on the end of it that you could pull off with your teeth would work.  I think it's essential when you're going out for a 7- or 8-hour EVA, you have to have something in that suit to drink.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|Yes; that really saved me out there.
106:48:05|Young|tech|I took my suit off (after <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html#1054424" target="new" target="alsj">105:44:24</a>) and didn't put the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bag</a> in right for the first EVA.  I didn't get anything to drink while I was out on the Moon (see <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1post.html#1261134" target="new" target="alsj">126:11:34</a>); and that was bad.  I sure could have used a drink about halfway through.  You do sweat a lot while you're out there.  You sweat in your hands, you sweat at the back of your neck, and you sweat on your feet where you don't have any water cooling.  We should have one (that is, a drink bag) that doesn't spend its time wetting you down.  And there was another problem associated with this.  Before we went out the next day (at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1182547" target="new" target="alsj">118:25:47</a>), Charlie had to clean the orange juice out of his microphone to get it to work.  He wasn't transmitting at all.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|On VOX.
106:48:05|Young|tech|He had a comm carrier with one mike gone because of a busted wire, and had to suck the orange juice out of the other mike to get it to work.  Now that's a pretty marginal operation.  (Laughter)
106:48:05|Duke|tech|Every time the left microphone hit that (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bag</a>) valve, the juice sort of migrated up that microphone in under my helmet, and this whole (left) side of my  head was just caked with juice.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Charlie looked like he had been shampooing with juice.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|It was really terrible.
106:48:05|Young|tech|The whole side of his face was just one big mass of orange juice.  We got it on the helmet seal between the second and third EVA.  We cleaned the orange juice off the helmet seal because we couldn't get the helmets unlocked and off.  I thought we were going to spend the night in the pressure suit.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|It really wasn't on the O-ring; it was where the two surfaces mate together.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Yes.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|The stuff had seeped in there.
106:48:05|Young|tech|The vacuum dried out that thing, and left the glue (that is, the partially dried orange juice) there.  When it was time to take the helmet off, I couldn't get Charlie's off and he couldn't get mine off.  I tell you, I thought we were going to stay in the pressure suit.  (Laughter)  I couldn't pull the (lock) button out, and I couldn't get it to slide.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|The button (on John's) would come out, but I couldn't make it slide up or down.
106:48:05|Mattingly|tech|If that's the case with both of you, then is that really a case against the orange juice; or is that something else?
106:48:05|Duke|tech|It's the orange juice.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Mine was leaking, too.  At least it wasn't leaking as bad as Charlie's.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|It was enough to solidify when he stepped out on the surface.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Where you get the problem with the orange juice is during the Prep.  It's not bad once you get on the Moon (that is, once you get outside).  It's not bad because you're not bending into it all the time.  While you're doing a Prep, there's a lot of looking down you have to do, and every time you bend your head forward and wrap your microphone around that thing and pull back, that works the plug (means the valve) and it squirts in your ear.  It's already under pressure, because you have 32 ounces in there, and you're bending forward so your chest is pushing on it.  It's just like a pump that pumps orange juice right into your mouth, your face, or your ear.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|Maybe you could design a valve like the one for Skylab.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Design one that works.  Well, I'll tell you, I really believe that by having a lot of something to drink in a pressure suit is the way to go.  I think it sure helped me and Charlie out on the surface, but it certainly got to be a problem with orange juice floating around the cockpit (in zero g) as a (potential) electrical conductor.  With it floating all over you and getting in your comm carrier, it's a problem; and then floating down in the neckring or - worse yet would be getting it on the neckring seal where you couldn't lock that helmet.
106:48:05||alsj|&quot;In training, we had orange juice get on our neckring and the only way they could get the thing locked was to go back and take the neckring apart and clean the residue out of those locking dogs.  They took the whole helmet apart and cleaned it out.  That's the only way we could get it to work.  That would bite you in lunar orbit, because I don't know how to do that; I don't know how you take that neckring apart.&quot;
106:48:05|Duke|tech|Even with all those problems, I'm glad we had something to drink.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Yes, I am too.  Now, whether it has to be orange juice, I don't know.  Maybe plain water would do.  In fact, for the first EVA, water was what I had in mine.  I drank the bag (of orange juice) the day before.  Maybe they could fortify the water with the potassium - if they insist on that being there - or maybe there would be a pill you could put in there.  I don't have any idea whether it would make any difference whether you did it or not.
106:48:05|Unidentified Speaker|tech|They should be able to make that valve so that it doesn't leak.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|They overdid it.
106:48:05||alsj|Here, Charlie may be referring to a design change in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink-bag valve</a> that may have been done following the troubles Jim Irwin had making his work.
106:48:05|Young|tech|It does exactly what it's supposed to do.  The trouble is, every time you catch your microphone in it and pull back, it pulls the valve forward and it works just like it's supposed to; and when you let up on it, it stops.  But, I mean, it's sort of a rock and a hard place.  If the microphones came around your nose, you wouldn't have this interference problem with the thing; but that would be a big re-design.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|I don't think it would be worth it.
106:48:05|Young|tech|I think they could make a little soft cap that you could pull off with your teeth, because you sure don't want it leaking on you at zero gravity.
106:48:05|Duke|tech|That was really terrible.
106:48:05|Young|tech|It could drown you.  Charlie was in there with a helmet full of orange juice when we were coming down to PDI.
106:48:05|Slayton|tech|Was it your plan to leave the helmets on once you'd landed, or (means 'and') go straight out for EVA?
106:48:05|Young|tech|No, no, we were going to take them off.
106:48:05|Slayton|tech|So we could put a cap on there that you could take off after you took your helmet off.
106:48:05|Young|tech|Take it off, just prior to donning your helmet for the EVA.  Yes; with your hands.
106:48:05||alsj|Despite the length of time spent on this issue during the technical debrief, there is no more than a brief summary of these points in the Mission Report and no discussion of any corrective action.  The Apollo 17 crew had plain water in their <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bags</a> and, because there was no discussion of valve problems during the mission, I presume that a cap was provided as per John's suggestion.
106:49:51||alsj|The meals were listed in the Medical Log and, because of the landing delay, Charlie wants to know if Houston wants to change the order.  Details for the meals can be found in  the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM11Menu.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LM Menu</a> given in the Apollo 16 Press Kit ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_PressKit.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">5.6 Mb</a>  PDF ).
106:49:51|Jones|alsj|Can you describe how the meals were packaged?
106:49:51|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Let's see.
106:49:51|Jones|alsj|Were all the packages for one meal taped together?
106:49:51|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Each day we had packets for each meal.  Like Day 1, Meal A.  A, B, C was for breakfast lunch and dinner - (although), on the lunar surface, we only got to eat two meals a day.  Each meal came wrapped and vacuum packed in a plastic wrapper; and you cut that wrapper open and that exposed three or four bags of ingredients.  And one of those bags would be a drink; and one of them would be a dessert; and one of them would be a, you know, some vegetable; and one of them would be whatever.  In fact, there was probably more than four or five bags.  And each bag would have instructions on the side of the bag.  Like a dessert might be cookie squares or something and all you do is cut the bag open and eat those.  But the orange juice  would be 'eight ounces of cold water and wait five minutes' or two minutes or whatever it was.  And, so, you'd follow the instructions to prepare it.  The only problem on the lunar surface was that there was no hot water, so the meals were just lousy.  Well, I don't say it was lousy.  That's the wrong word.  You know, with cold water, it just didn't taste too good.
106:49:51|Jones|alsj|The 17 guys had what Jack describes as predecessors of the current 'Meal Ready to Eat', irradiated foods that you don't have to re-hydrate.
106:49:51|Duke|alsj|We had some of that.  We had these little bacon squares and cheese something-or-others.  We had tins of like ham spread and tuna spread; and we had a tin of peanut butter and, like, vacuum-packed bread.  And you could prepare those.  Now, I don't remember any of that being on the lunar surface, though.  It seems to me all of that kind of stuff was all in the command ship.
106:49:51||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-19887.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-19887</a> shows Apollo dietician Rita Rapp posing with some of the Apollo 16 food packages.  The package in the center foreground is labeled 'Day 4, Meal A'.
106:49:51||alsj|While we were discussing the meal packaging, Charlie looked through his collection to find the Medical Log.
106:49:51|Duke|alsj|Here we go, this is the medical log.  Here's the menu. I knew I had it.  So we started with Day 5 Meal B:  'Cream of Tomato soup; rye bread, two slices; tuna spread, half a can; apple food bar; a chocolate bar; an orange/grapefruit beverage; and a food stick'.  That <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">food stick</a> was a thing that stuck inside the suit and it came up like this (on the right-hand side of the neckring) and, when you were out on the surface, you could just reach over (with your teeth) and pull it up and chop off a piece.  And it was really high-energy stuff.  And then, on the other side (of the neckring), was that EVA beverage bag.  That was Velcroed (in place) and a straw came up right about here.
106:49:51|Jones|alsj|Okay; and the straw's on the left side.
106:49:51|Duke|alsj|So you can see, the only thing (in Day 5 Meal B) we really had to prepare that was dehydrated was the Cream of Tomato soup - and, with cold water, that didn't taste very good.  But the tuna spread, the rye bread, the apple food bar...(Reading his handwritten comments in the Medical Log) I ate a third of the chocolate bar.  And you can see they had some little sexy drawing that we ripped out (post-flight).
106:49:51||alsj|What remained of the cartoon suggested that it originally showed a scantily-clad waitress.
106:49:51|Jones|alsj|I notice the strange spelling of eggs:  'AIGS'.
106:49:51||alsj|Duke - (Laughing)&quot;Scrambled eggs.  That's Southern.  For eggs.  (Pause)  And you see, we had two meals a day.  (Pause)  I guess the shrimp cocktail was probably dehydrated; so was the turkey-and-gravy.  I liked that.&quot;
106:49:51||alsj|We discussed the drawings and other &quot;unofficial&quot; material in the Medical Log, Flight Plan, and other on-board documents.
106:49:51|Duke|alsj|Throughout our plan, in various places...Like the kids'd draw me a little picture and it was inserted in the flight plan.  I had a card from Dotty once.  Those kind of things.  They were in the flight plan.  Little messages from the kids, a picture of the family, stuff like that.
106:51:19||alsj|Charlie's &quot;B&quot; sounds more like &quot;D&quot;.
106:52:34|Jones|alsj|John lost his spoon?
106:52:34|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  I don't know where or when; I don't remember the details, now; but we looked high and low for that spoon.  And he finally found it.  (Chuckling)  And I don't even remember where he found it!

South Ray is just outside the image at the lower left.  Baby Ray is at the left edge, just below center.]
106:53:30|Jones|alsj|Was there ever any discussion about driving down to South Ray.
106:53:30|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we wanted to do that; but they were concerned that, you know, if we broke down...
106:53:30|Jones|alsj|That you would have been at the edge of walkback...
106:53:30|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
106:53:30||alsj|Over long distances, NASA assumed that the astronauts could achieve an average speed of 2.7 km/hr if they had to walk back to the LM.  Under that assumption, walkback from South Ray would have taken about 2.2 hours.  Had they planned to go to South Ray, they would have made that the first stop on the traverse so that, if the Rover broke down at South Ray at the end of their geology work there, they would have the largest possible supply of oxygen and cooling water.  Assuming a one-hour drive to South Ray, one hour of geology, and a two-hour walkback, they would still have plenty of margins.  Indeed, while South Ray is 6.5 km from the Apollo 16 landing spot, Nansen Crater, which Cernan and Schmitt visited on their second EVA, is an 8.2 km driving distance from their LM.  However, the terrain near South Ray is likely to be more difficult than anything the Apollo 17 crew encountered and, as Charlie implies, uncertainties about terrain and crew endurance probably settled the question.
106:53:30||alsj|Journal Contributor David Harland and I have discussed changes in the EVA planning that would have been necessary to accommodate a visit to South Ray.  To do so without sacrificing either the ALSEP deployment or the visit to North Ray, I believe that the South Ray stop would have to have been added to the EVA-2 traverse.  Because walkback constraints dictate that the farthest station be the first stop, John and Charlie would have driven directly to South Ray and then, in order to sample of the Descartes formation, would have had to drive up onto Stone Mountain during the return to the LM.  David argues that, because of the need to detour around the Wreck/Stubby Complex on a drive to South Ray, a more viable plan would have been modeled on the Apollo 15 EVAs, with a visit to South Ray conducted at the start of EVA-1, a return on a more westerly track than John and Charlie actually drove on EVA-2, and stops at Plum and Buster on the way back to the LM.  In David's sketch plan, the ALSEP deployment would have been delayed until EVA-2, which would have also included a drive to Stone Mountain, but with far fewer stops on the return to the LM.  These are the kinds of trade-offs that may have been made during the pre-mission EVA planning by people who were far more knowledgeable about realistic constraints than either David or I; and, in reality, the likelihood that John and Charlie were going to be able to sample South Ray ejecta during the stops on the rays made a visit to the crater scientifically unnecessary.  Nonetheless, South Ray  is undoubtedly a stunning location and the attraction for John and Charlie is easy to understand.
106:53:30|Duke|alsj|We thought we were okay (on a walkback from South Ray),  but they were very conservative on walkback.  John and I had gotten in the centrifuge in Houston and they'd attached a hydraulic sling onto the end of the centrifuge arm.  And we got in this sling and they just picked us up until we were one-sixth g and they had a simulated moon surface around the rim of the centrifuge and we just started running, to see how far we could go before we tired out - to give us some idea of how far away we could get and walk back.  (The accompanying  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a12.s69_56059.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photograph</a> shows Al Bean in the centrifuge harness during Apollo 12 training.)  And I think we both did...We did it on separate days but I remember (that it was) four or five hours we ran.  And, you know, once you got going, it was almost effortless.  But it was level.  We must have covered - I don't know - twenty kilometers, maybe.
106:53:30|Jones|alsj|I believe that.
106:53:30||alsj|An August 22, 1972 memo from P.E. Reynolds at Bell Labs 'Review of the EVA Contingency Walkback Capability for Apollo 17' includes a discussion of the long-duration traverse testing that John and Charlie did in the centrifuge building.  &quot;One particular test provided data for long duration walking.  This test performed prior to Apollo 15 by astronauts John Young and Charlie Duke, each fully suited and in a one-sixth gravity rig, established that astronauts could perform for long duration at high mobility rates.  The rates achieved were more of a trot or run than a walking rate.  These data are shown in Table 3.  The time-in-motion differs from the total time due to stops for equipment malfunctions and repairs.  Specific rest periods were not planned.  John Young achieved an average speed on 6.5 km/hr for 2 hours and 43 minutes, while Charles Duke averaged 5.5 km/hr for 3 hours 18 minutes.  Although these test runs did not include negotiating broken terrain (the test was done on a smooth track), the results established an endurance capability in suited condition.&quot;]
106:53:30||alsj|The data in Table 3 are:
106:53:30||alsj|Note that simple multiplication of the times-in-motion and the average speeds indicate that John and Charlie each ran about 18 kilometers.
106:53:30||alsj|In reviewing the various Apollo video records,  I have timed several short, quick runs by J-mission astronauts and the achieved speeds over distances of no more than 100 meters were also of the order of 5 km/hr.  In all cases, the ground was relatively flat - to the extent that any of the sites can be described as 'flat'.]
106:53:30|Duke|alsj|It was a long way.  Four or five hours.  But, you know, it wasn't up and down and over boulders and loosely consolidated terrain, and so NASA management just said ' well, that's nice, you guys, but you're not going to go to South Ray.'
106:53:30|Jones|alsj|Do you have any feeling on how realistic the centrifuge simulation was in terms of the effort, having done that and then having actually gone and run at least a hundred meters in a few cases.
106:53:30|Duke|alsj|It was pretty good.  Especially on the level terrain.  Up on the top of Stone Mountain, you had to be very careful.  It was tough going up the hill and, coming back down the hill, you had to be real careful.
106:53:30|Jones|alsj|But in terms of c.g. (center-of-gravity) management, was it a good simulation?  Did you have a backpack on when you did the four or five hour...
106:53:30|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we did.  But the sling sort gave you a little bit of stability that you didn't have up on the Moon.  I found I fell down a lot more up there than...It was easy to lose your balance: either to drag a foot (and get thrown off balance) or to bend down to pick up something - or to reach out and touch something - it would be just enough to give you a rotation, and that rotation'd usually throw you down.  At least, it did me.  And so we got where I fell down a lot.  But it just never really concerned me.  The only time it really did was when I jumped up and fell over backwards at the last of the EVA.
106:53:30|Jones|alsj|The 15 guys and the earlier crews didn't fall down a lot and the 17 guys fell down even more than you did.  My feeling is that it was just more confidence in yourselves and the suits and in your ability to get up.  That you were more aggressive than the earlier crews.
106:53:30|Duke|alsj|I agree.  We were more aggressive.  I had a lot of confidence in that suit and I just felt 'if you're going to fall down, it's not going to be any big deal'.  And, so, we weren't cautious.  We had all that experience of four other missions before us, so we just pressed on and attacked, really.  That's a good observation.
106:57:38|Jones|alsj|I know that some of the geologists were hoping to find evidence of volcanics on Stone Mountain.  Is John speculating about that here?&quot;]
106:57:38|Duke|alsj|He doesn't want to commit to what it is, yet.
106:57:38|Jones|alsj|But is he entertaining the possibility that there might be...&quot;]
106:57:38|Duke|alsj|Well, I don't think it's so much that it's about volcanics.  At this point, he's looking at these craters and I think he's trying to decide whether they're primary or secondary impact craters.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
106:58:36||alsj|The nature of the ray edges, the lines of contact with non-ray material, was a point of practical interest.  If the contacts were sharp, then John and Charlie could sample material on both sides at one geology stop.  Here, John is saying that, while there are no sharply defined contacts, he thinks they will be able to find places that are definitely on a ray or off a ray.]</i></blockquote>
106:59:05|Young|tech|I think, because we practiced so much with the L&amp;A, we had a pretty good hack on how far away we were from things.&quot;]
106:59:05||alsj|Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-72-H-430.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">72-H-430</a> shows John and Charlie doing a traverse simulation in which the TV image from the Landing and  Ascent (L&amp;A) facility - consisting of a site model suspended over a moveable TV camera - was tied to John's inputs from the handcontroller.  These practice traverses gave John and Charlie a good feel for the appearance and relative location of the major features of the landing site.]
106:59:05|Young|tech|And the only change I'd make (in his estimate of where they landed) - and I don't know how much of a change it is - is that, after we got out and went up on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.4623lbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Stone Mountain</a> and looked back, you could see <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Double Spot</a> and you could see the Lunar Module (see AS16-112- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18272" target="new" target="alsj">18272</a>), and it looked as if we were maybe 70 or 80 meters further east than I said we were originally. That's just a guess, because we're sitting up north (means south) on a hill and looking back, and you could see Double Spot.  And the Lunar Module appeared to be sitting in a hole over behind Double Spot, and it's almost in a direct line from where we were on Stone Mountain.  So we must have come very close to landing exactly where we were scheduled to land in the first place.  And I emphasize again, the only reason for landing there was to get a spot that wasn't so hilly.  Pre-flight, that region around Double Spot was the only flat place on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj"> (central) map</a> as far as the contour lines go.  I think it was a mistake.&quot;]
106:59:05||alsj|John means that the contour map was faulty.
106:59:05|Duke|tech|It turned out, I think, the flattest spot we saw on the whole traverse was up to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623nlbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">southeast of North Ray Crater in that valley past Palmetto</a>.  It was a broad, smooth valley and (had) hardly any craters in it at all.  No rocks.&quot;]
106:59:05|Young|tech|No rocks at all; and, on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp265.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">(northern) contour map</a>, that (area) looks pretty bad.&quot;]
106:59:05|Duke|tech|But it was about where <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Dogleg (Crater)</a> was mapped ( see, also, a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623nlbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">labeled detail</a> from Pan Camera frame 4623); in that area, back off to the right there by the traverse.  I had a good feel at pitchover of exactly where we were. Once we got to the ground and I looked out John's window, I felt like I could reach out and touch South Ray and Stone Mountain.  They just looked that close to me.  I had a tough time estimating (distances) and I knew they were 5 kilometers away; and I just had a tough time estimating distance of big features, once we got on the ground.&quot;]
106:59:05|Young|tech|On a clear day (on Earth), the mountains are 40 miles away and (yet) it looks like you'd be there in 4 minutes.  It's the same thing on the Moon.  We kept going over rises and I kept thinking, 'here's Stone Mountain'.  And then we'd go over another (ridge), and it wouldn't get you there.&quot;]
106:59:45|Duke|tech|There were lots of ridges between us and that mountain.  It wasn't apparent when we first looked out the window.&quot;]</i></blockquote>  <b>106:59:45</b> Duke: A second comment has to do with the orbital, since we got so much (of a) look at the ground sailing around (for three extra orbits) waiting to come down.  Everywhere we saw the ground - which is just about the whole sunlit side - in the crater walls and on the ridges, we had the same lineation that the Apollo 15 photography showed on Hadley Delta and Hadley Mountain (see, for example, AS15-90-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/images15.html#12208" target="new" target="alsj">12208</a>).  It was really remarkable how, in the crater walls, primarily, and in the ridges....And it gave you the impression that it was a fracture pattern that was all trending parallel to the...(finding the right word) concentric around the craters.  In the craters...And on the ridge, though, they were sort of either parallel to the ground or at some dip, be what that may.  Over.
107:00:31||alsj|John is referring to the pictures he took at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html#1061606" target="new" target="alsj">106:16:06</a>, particularly AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18296" target="new" target="alsj">18296</a>.

In the 18 hours between the times at which these pictures were taken, the Sun rose about 9 degrees.]</i></blockquote>
107:01:42||alsj|If Stone Mountain is older than Stubby, then the wall of the crater at the bottom of the mountain might be relatively steep, softened only to the extent that material slid into it off the mountain. If the mountain were a volcanic construct younger than Stubby, the crater wall might be relatively worn all around.]</i></blockquote>
107:05:37||alsj|Jones - (Chuckling) &quot;Do you have any comment about this little exchange?&quot;
107:05:37|Duke|alsj|I think John was thinking we were getting too technical.&quot;]
107:05:37|Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter|alsj|What caught my eye (while reading a draft of the Apollo 16 Journal), was the early observations (here and at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html#1061907" target="new" target="alsj">106:19:07</a>) - both from the LM window - that were describing rock types that were alien to the pre-mission photo-geologic interpretation of highlands volcanic rocks.  The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.html" target="new" target="alsj">geological field trips</a> that we took the crew on - primarily into andesite volcanos along Lake Mead a few miles east of Las Vegas (on February 17-18, 1972) that was torn in two by a strike-slip fault - showed both lava flows and flow breccia units.  Using that as an analogue, it (meaning Charlie's descriptions of 'black and white rocks') still didn't ring any warning bells in my head.  It may be I wasn't listening at the time they made those comments.  During landing I was sitting in a TV station waiting to comment on where they landed, did so, and then went into Mission Control to visit with my gang (of geologists) in the Backroom.&quot;]
107:05:37||alsj|See, also, Bill's comment following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1194111" target="new" target="alsj">119:41:11</a>.
107:06:21||alsj|Like the other J-mission crews, John and Charlie will use a geology tool that is rather like a clam rake with tines that are one centimeter apart.  The rake was designed by Caltech geologist <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lee_silver.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lee Silver</a> so that the astronauts could quickly fill an individual sample bag with walnut-sized rocks.]
107:06:21|Jones|alsj|Was there some question about being able to use the rake here?&quot;]
107:06:21|Duke|alsj|Well, yes. We weren't so sure that the regolith would have the rock sizes to be captured by the rake.  You know, you could pull it through (the soil) and come up with nothing. In fact, we did that a couple of times.  So, we were unsure about the use of the rake, but we decided to take it.  In fact, I never thought about maybe leaving it behind, really. But they were concerned.  You know: are there going to be rocks in the surface that you can pick up?  Is it all going to be fine-grained?  Is it just going to sieve through the rake?&quot;]</i></blockquote>
107:06:33|Jones|alsj|With the hose unstowed...
107:06:33|Duke|alsj|It's free-flow.  Yeah.  You know, when you plugged them into the walls, it would put some pressure like you had plugged into the suit, you see.&quot;]
107:06:33|Jones|alsj|Ah!
107:06:33|Duke|alsj|When it was open, it would just suck it in (freely) and, apparently, that caused the water separators to (run at higher than proper speed)...&quot;]
107:06:33|Jones|alsj|You wanted a pressure differential and the wall fitting gave you that.&quot;]
107:06:33|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
107:07:21||alsj|Chuckling  Okay.  (Pause)  Hey, the back room gave you a bravo on your descriptions there.  (Pause)
107:07:39||alsj|Clearly, Charlie is eager to get outside to look at the rocks.
107:16:09|Jones|alsj|Could you give me some words about this last exchange?&quot;]
107:16:09|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  There was a group of folks responsible for designing the sims.  And they would exercise all phases of the spacecraft and your knowledge of procedures and stuff.  So there'd be mission control and us at the Cape in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">simulator</a> and the network all around the world, and we'd simulate various phases of the mission.  And there was a group of guys - and gals, probably - and they were the sim guys and they would design the failures and feed the software into the computers to simulate whatever we were doing.  Generally in the simulator, if you ever landed you'd be on a wing and a prayer.  You know, you'd just be staggering in, cause </i>everything<i> would be breaking.  So what John's referring to there is 'put in a word to Big Sim, let's stop all this problem that we've been having' - you know, with the regulators and the comm and the Casper problem and all that - 'and let's get back to a nominal sim'.&quot;]
107:16:09|Jones|alsj|And was John also choosing his words to avoid the attentions of Madalyn Murray O'Hair (a militant atheist of the time)?
107:16:09|Duke|alsj|No.  Not really.  John's not religious at all.  He's just having fun.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
107:21:58||alsj|See the discussion prior to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.landing.html#1041309" target="new" target="alsj">104:13:09</a>.]</i></blockquote>
107:23:22||alsj|Gatorade is a mineral-fortified drink that was heavily advertised at the time as a help to athletes and others who needed to replenish fluids lost during vigorous exercise.  The potassium-fortified &quot;orange drink&quot; that John and Charlie are drinking to prevent a recurrence of the heart arrhythmias experienced by the Apollo 15 crew was similar to Gatorade but, here, Tony is probably trying to correct the impression that he has just given a commercial endorsement to that specific product.  My thanks to Brian Lawrence for pointing out this interesting little item in the transcript.  See the additional discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1072415" target="new" target="alsj">107:24:15</a>.
107:24:08|Jones|alsj|I assume that the Gatorade/orange juice was NASA's solution to the Apollo 15 potassium deficiency.
107:24:08|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And they felt like it maybe led to Jim (Irwin)'s heart problems, eventually.  So we had fortified food with potassium and other vitamins and stuff.  And the orange juice was fortified and all of the stuff that we were going to have out on the lunar surface, to give us some extra energy.  'Cause they (meaning the Apollo 15 crew) didn't have anything; and they were out there for a long time and they got real dehydrated.  So that's why we had the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bags</a>, and they were fortified to give us extra vitamins and replenish the minerals that we were losing.  Plus the food bar was a high energy...protein, carbohydrates or whatever it was.  But that's the reason.  So we'd have some energy.  And we figured that we'd be in better shape at first than at the end; so we'd rather have the fortified stuff at the end.
107:32:01||alsj|Both John and Charlie are wearing medical sensors, but only one of them can be monitored at any one time.
107:32:01|Jones|alsj|Did the sensors itch?
107:32:01|Duke|alsj|Well, we didn't take them off.  They were permanent.  And you stay on biomed, it means you've got to hook up to the cable; and it was hard to turn over and get comfortable with all that stuff on you.  You were always getting it tangled up.  So you'd just like to float around without it, or be on the surface without it.
107:43:58|Jones|alsj|Is that the kind of stuff you would have had stored in your head?  Or would you have had a book to consult?
107:43:58|Duke|alsj|The numbers you had to get.  Well, that 'Verb 25 Noun 07, Enter, 1706 Enter' would have been something we'd have known.
107:43:58|Jones|alsj|The procedure is something John would have had stored in his head?
107:43:58|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  We'd practiced.
107:47:30||alsj|They have probably raised the window shades, an obvious action not called out in the checklist on either page 3-5 or 3-6.
107:47:42|Young|tech|I know people have remarked on this before, but there's a lot more light in that vehicle than there is in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lunar Module Simulator</a> (LMS).  I don't know why they want to keep it so dark in there; but we didn't have any trouble reading any of the gauges.  My subjective opinion of the light produced by those utility lights was much better than it is in the simulator.
107:49:46|Jones|alsj|Is Tony's 'I'll whistle something' a reference to the wake-up music?
107:49:46|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
107:49:46|Jones|alsj|And the selection of that was entirely up to the folks in mission control.
107:49:46|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
107:52:22||alsj|During the ALSEP deployment, Charlie plans to  drill three holes:  two 2.5-meter holes for the heat flow experiment and a 3.0-meter hole for the deep core.  He wants to be sure that, wherever he does the drilling, there is at least 3 meters of regolith on top of the bedrock.
108:00:15||alsj|Readers should note that, unlike the EVA CapComs on the other missions, Tony has chosen to be on duty whenever the crew is on the surface and awake.  Like everyone else, he has already had a long day because of the six-hour landing delay.

112:34:11|Jones|alsj|If I remember, you talked about this little wake-up in 'Moonwalker'.
112:34:11|Duke|alsj|If I remember right, it just rattled me right up out of sleep.  That Master Alarm goes off in your (Snoopy) helmet, since I was on comm.  I've forgot what it sounded like, but 'bong, bong, bong' and, God, it was loud!  I went out almost through the top of the...Almost jumped out of my skin!
112:34:11|Jones|alsj|But you got it figured out pretty quick.
112:34:11|Duke|alsj|Well, yeah.  Then I saw what the Master Alarm was.  'Cause they said we were going to get it.  It was a low quantity light.  They told us about it (at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1072107" target="new" target="alsj">107:21:07</a>) before we went to sleep.
112:34:11|Jones|alsj|And you were sleeping in the lower <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LM10f1-6Hammocks.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">hammock</a>, across the front with your head...
112:34:11|Duke|alsj|On the right side.  On my side.
112:34:11||alsj|The layout of the hammocks is shown in a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/a12.hammocks.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">drawing</a> from the Apollo 12 Press Kit.
112:34:11|Jones|alsj|How was the sleeping in the hammock?
112:34:11|Duke|alsj|Well, it was...Fine!  When you got your mind in idle, the sleeping was really comfortable in the one-sixth gravity.  The hammock was pretty nice.  Of course, with hammocks you've got to sleep on your back.  Maybe a little bit on your side is about all you could do.  It just took me a while to get to sleep.  And, if you look at our medical chart, John's on Day 5 was '(Medication) None; sleep 7 1/2 hours, good...'  I had 'Seconal; 6 1/2 to 7, good.  Seconal, 7 hours, good' And then the last night, I didn't take one.  The first two nights I had to take a sleeping pill.
112:34:11|Jones|alsj|And that was excitement.
112:34:11|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Just to get your mind in idle.

The suits were up into the hammock about three inches.  So I wasn't suspended, I was laying on top of the pressure suits.  It's kind of an unusual position because of it; it gets right up under your back.
|<a name="wakeup">Duke</a>|tech|As I reported, the first two nights I took a Seconal.  It helped me (overcome the excitement and get to sleep).  I slept really well all three nights on the lunar surface.
|Young|tech|The first night, I was really warm and I had taken all the gear off and hung the FCS and WMS up to dry and slept in the sleeping bag with nothing on.  I woke up in the middle of the night and my feet were freezing.  So I turned around (that is, put his head toward the front of the cabin and his feet toward the rear) and put the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#ISA" target="new" target="alsj">ISA</a> (Interim Stowage Assembly) over my feet and went right back to sleep.  Worked like a charm.  But the next couple of nights I slept in the LCG (Liquid Cooled Garment, but without water flow, obviously) because it was really cold at night.&quot;]
||alsj|Readers should note that the thermal differences in the cabin during the rest period are (1) some of the electrical equipment is powered down, (2) the shades are drawn to cut down on the reflected light entering the windows, and (3) the astronauts aren't moving around.  In a small, confined space, reduction in such heat sources can have a dramatic temperature effect.
|Duke|tech|(It was) chilly at night.  You need a sleeping bag.  Even with the LCG on, you needed a sleeping bag.  You didn't need it when you started to sleep but, by the middle of the night...At least, I'd wake up in the middle of the night and I was cold and I wanted to get in that bag.  The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/a12.hammocks.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">hammocks</a> were great.
|Young|tech|Yes, I thought so, too.
||alsj|<a name="1140000">At a Ground Elapsed Time of about 114 hours</a>,  NASA's Public Affairs commentator tells the press that current plans call for three 7-hour EVAs, with EVA-1 starting  at 119.28; EVA-2 at 141.43; EVA-3 at 165:30.  Lift-off was originally scheduled for 171:45 but will now happen at about 177:28.  The limiting factor is the water supply in the Descent Stage.  At lift-off, there will be about a five-hour supply remaining, a reduction from the original margin.
115:51:18||alsj|The mission started at 17:54 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) on April 16, 1972 and it is currently 13:45 GMT on April 21st.

115:53:33|Duke|alsj|I couldn't stand him sleeping any longer.  I want to get him up and get going.  I wanted to make sure we stayed on schedule.
115:53:33|Jones|alsj|Did you have a food list you could select meals from, or did somebody do it for you?
115:53:33|Duke|alsj|We had a list of foods; and the dietitian would recommend...Her name was <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#S7219887" target="new" target="alsj">Rita Rapp</a>; and she would try to design a meal but you had a lot of variety within the meal.  It was a balanced diet and a balanced meal, with so many calories was her target each day...
115:53:33|Jones|alsj|And low residue (to reduce the frequency of defecation).
115:53:33|Duke|alsj|And low residue.  Yeah.  So you had pea soup, you had cream-of-tomato soup, you had mushroom soup, maybe; and you had different kind of breads and you had the tuna spread and peanut butter spread and the ham spread.  There were a variety of things.  And these little food bars that we had, they were real high energy.  I don't remember 'em being too bad; it seems like this implied John didn't like 'em.  It was like a chewy granola - almost - except more chewy than that.  Not crunchy at all.
115:53:33|Jones|alsj|Anything about the rye bread?
115:53:33|Duke|alsj|I don't remember why we didn't eat it.  I guess it was pretty dry and we were thirsty.  That's probably the main reason.  Because we tried all the food before we went and, if we didn't really like something, we didn't pick it.  Rita had let us sample everything.  Like I had some...I don't think we had any on the lunar surface, but I had her make some grits.  I wanted to have some grits!  She didn't have any grits for us southern boys.  So I had some in the Command Module and, of course, we had hot water up there, so they were pretty good.  But it took her two or three iterations to get the grits where they were worthwhile.  Boy, the first bunch she came back (with) and they were just awful.  It was terrible.  But then, you know, a little bit of salt, a little bit of butter, and a little bit of here and a little bit there.  By the time we got ready to fly, they were pretty good, so I ate all mine.

115:55:22||alsj|As John noted in the Tech Debrief, these emergency lift-off times were of little value with the Mission Timer turned off.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html#1051125" target="alsj">105:11:25.</a>
115:56:27|Duke|alsj|They would change the ground elapsed time for some reason to coordinate something or other.  You know, time was arbitrary, anyway.  And, so, they wanted to sync(hronize) something, and so they would change the GET - by 11 minutes and 48 seconds, for some reason.
115:59:53|Jones|alsj|With reference to your let John get on comm, the only comm you had in the cabin was the earpieces on the Snoopy headgear?  There was no speaker?
115:59:53|Duke|alsj|No; we didn't have a speaker.  You had to put on your hat.
116:13:06|Duke|alsj|He lived almost right across the street from us. In El Lago.  If I remember...No, he didn't live over there.
116:13:06|Jones|alsj|But it was close?
116:13:06|Duke|alsj|Yeah; a couple of miles away.
116:13:11||alsj|Traverse map <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267-s.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj"> EVA-I, III 1 of 3 </a> shows the planned EVA-1 traverse route.  The following is taken from the Final Lunar Surface Procedures volume and describes pre-flight thinking about the landing site.
116:13:11||alsj|&quot;The lunar highlands appear to consist of three major types of deposits: (1) undivided pre-Imbrium materials and older, degraded crater materials, (2) ejecta blankets composed of material by the major basin-forming events - e.g., Mare Imbrium formation - that are typified by the Apollo 14 Fra Mauro and Apollo 15 Apennine Mountains highland areas, and (3) volcanic constructional materials that are exemplified by the Descartes highland region, the Apollo 16 lunar landing site.&quot;]
116:13:11||alsj|&quot;The Descartes area is an outstanding location to sample and study the petrochemistry of two volcanic constructional units of the lunar highlands: the Cayley formation unit and the Kant Plateau unit, of which two separate and distinct portions are present.&quot;
116:13:11||alsj|&quot;Fresh craters of various sizes, also present within the candidate landing area, allow sampling of these highland units to various depths.  The mounded floors of craters within this landing area - up to 1 kilometer in diameter - suggest that a lower layer of unknown origin has been penetrated.&quot;
116:13:11||alsj|Kiva Crater, at CX/73 on EVA-I, III 2 of 2, is one of these craters with a central dome.
116:13:11||alsj|&quot;The Cayley formation unit is highlands plains material consisting mostly of smooth to undulating terrain, probably resulting from fluid volcanic flow rock and pyroclastic detritus.  This unit is the largest single identifiable rock unit on the near side of the Moon - covers 7 percent of (the) Nearside - except for mare regions.  The Descartes Mountains (including Stone Mountain) - (which form the western) edge of the Kant Plateau unit - are composed of hilly and furrowed highland plateau material that is probably the product of more viscous volcanic flow rock, pyroclastics, and their associated cones.  This type of unit covers 4.3 percent of the near side of the Moon.  This landing site provides a unique opportunity to accomplish dating and other studies of the morphological evolution of young, bright-rayed craters.  The geological information obtained can be applied to infer ages of other visible craters of apparently similar construction.&quot;
116:13:11||alsj|&quot;The specific geological features recommended for sampling in the proposed landing area (site 2 on Figure 2.5-3) are as follows: (a) Cayley Plains which include young, bright-rayed craters (such as) North Ray, South Ray; (b) South Descartes Mountains, (specifically) Stone Mountain; (c) North Descartes Mountains, (specifically) Smoky Mountain; and (d) subdued craters and crater chains.&quot;

116:15:48||alsj|They will use the UV camera to take photographs of various astronomical targets.]
116:15:48|Duke|alsj|We had a restriction.  The thing had to be in the (LM) shadow, but they wanted it far enough away from the Lunar Module...I don't know whether it was a field-of-view problem or it was a contamination problem from dust on the lens or something.  I don't remember, exactly; but, with the higher sun angle, it left the shadow shorter.  And so we had to move the camera back in closer because of the length-of-the-shadow problem.  But I don't remember the details of their concerns.&quot;]
116:15:48||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp006.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, had they started EVA-1 at the planned time of 103 hours, the sun elevation would have been about 11 degrees.  They will actually start the EVA at about 119 hours and the sun elevation at that time will be about 22 degrees.  Because the LM is approximately 7 meters tall, the shadow lengths at sun elevations of 11 and 22 degrees are 36 and 17 meters, respectively.  Because the UV camera is about 1.4 meters tall, to be in complete shadow it has to be placed closer to the LM than these figures would indicate.  See AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18339" target="new" target="alsj">18339</a> for the EVA-1 UV camera placement.

116:17:08||alsj|Here, Charlie is referring to flashes of light that were reported by all of the crews starting with Apollo 11.  When they had their eyes closed, the astronauts saw occasional flashes of light (a few per minute) which, it was quickly realized, were probably caused by cosmic rays entering their eyes.  The ALFMED (Apollo Light-Flash Moving-Emulsion Detector) was flown on Apollo 16 to determine the precise mechanism involved.  The device is shown in Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf27-17.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">27-17</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf27-18.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">27-18</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf27-19.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">27-19</a> from the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> and contained sets of photographic plates which were used to determine the characteristics of the cosmic ray particles that excited flashes what were verbally reported by an astronaut while wearing the device.  Charlie wore the ALFMED for one hour on the Translunar portion of the mission and, as well, for an hour during the TransEarth coast.  During those same times, John wore eye shades and reported any flashes he saw.  The subject wearing an ALFMED in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf27-19.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">27-19</a> may be E.

116:17:08||alsj|Journal Contributor David Woods calls our attention to the following from Apollo 11 CMP Michael Collins' superb </i>Carrying the Fire<i>: &quot;(I) did not notice any in flight...but now I can make my imagination work either for or against the idea and conjure up a darkness which is either absolute or penetrated occasionally by a tiny white streak crossing my retina. Unable to make an honest contribution, I stay out of the conversation.&quot;
116:18:06||alsj|Because Charlie loaded the Equipment Transfer Bag (ETB) as per checklist page 2-1 prior to the rest period, once he and John finish breakfast, they will don the suits are per checklist page 3-8.
116:44:15||alsj|Houston is trying to get the high-gain antenna to work.
116:51:40|Duke|alsj|I remember taking a picture of that antenna (AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18336" target="new" target="alsj">18336</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18337" target="new" target="alsj">18337</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18338" target="new" target="alsj">18338</a>).  When we first docked with the Lunar Module following trans-lunar insertion, there was a lot of white stuff floating into space.  It turned out that it was some paint peeling off.  So, when we looked up to take a picture of the antenna, I saw this paint that was curled up.  It looked like the sun had hit it, you know?  It was peeling off.  So that came out in the picture.  I don't remember whether this latching mechanism showed up or not.&quot;]

116:52:05|Duke|alsj|We were in there talking to ourselves.  We were getting suited up at this point, and a lot of it was just talking to ourselves.  You know, 'where are we going to put this?' and those kind of things.  We had things all over and we had to keep things together and try to get 'em stowed in the right place so we could track 'em down when we got ready to use 'em.  So (during) a lot of this, we were not hot miked.  We did a lot of talking between ourselves as we were suiting up that wasn't on the air until we went hot mike.
116:52:05||alsj|Readers should note that, for some reason, John forgets to install his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bag</a>.
116:52:05|Young|tech|On the first one, I forgot to put the drink bag in until after I got my suit on.  And you cannot put the drink bag in with the suit on.  Charlie put it in (at some point after <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1173604" target="new" target="alsj">117:36:04</a>), and I helped him stuff it down; and it wasn't good enough.
116:52:05|Duke|tech|Well, it went in; but you couldn't drink out of it.
116:52:05|Young|tech|I turned my head while we were outside, pulled the valve over, got it down in here somewhere and never could get the valve.  I had it down in my neckring somewhere.  I mean, I tried.  I was down in the suit (that is, bending his neck as much as possible to get his mouth partway into the neckring) scrounging around for it, but I could never get there.
116:54:51||alsj|They are now at the top of the right-hand column on 3-8.  John's &quot;where're we going to stow them&quot; may be a reference to the LCG plug and the PGA (Pressure Garment Assembly) Electrical Connector Cap which he will stow in a Beta-cloth bag, called the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="new" target="alsj">purse</a>&quot; which is hanging below Panel 5, directly in front of John.
116:59:10||alsj|John's unintentional transmission was originally transcribed as &quot;You could've done it last night, you asshole&quot; and, indeed, that is what it sounded like to me until I listened very carefully to the tape while preparing this commentary.  Thanks, in part, to the original transcription, at the time of my mission review with Charlie, I was under the impression that John was cursing at him and, consequently, I approached the subject with more circumspection than was necessary in light of what I now believe is the correct transcription.
116:59:10|Jones|alsj|One of the things that Jack commented on - Jack and Gene both - is that, in normal conversation between them, things tended to be fairly earthy; but, when the mikes were on, almost subconsciously, the word choices...
116:59:10|Duke|alsj|You clean it up.  We had the same problem.  Lot of times...Well, not a lot of times but this happened to us two or three times - at least three I can remember, and one especially in lunar orbit while we were waiting to go down, we had this orange juice problem and John started getting a lot of gas and, you know, it was really stinking up the whole place.  He was farting like crazy and he starts bitching about this orange juice and I think it was printed, verbatim, in Aviation Week!  And we were just laughing and giggling about it all, and all of that was going down to Houston.  So this is just another situation where that happened.  You know, you think you're talking to yourself and you just get, like you say, a little earthy.  But we tried not to do that when we were hot-miked but it slipped up on us a couple of times.
116:59:10|Jones|alsj|Somebody reading this, who didn't know all of you, might think that John's 'you asshole' would be a pretty...
116:59:10|Duke|alsj|He wasn't talking to me.
116:59:10|Jones|alsj|He was talking to himself?
116:59:10|Duke|alsj|No, what he was really talking about was, you know, the people could have told us to do that last night, you see?  So he was really referring to the ground when he said that.
117:00:01||alsj|Despite Tony's veiled suggestion that they turn off the Vox, they do not do so immediately.  We hear them talking, but the microphone does not pick up enough for the conversation to be intelligible.]</i></blockquote>
117:12:39|Duke|alsj|We'd had a problem, going out (to the Moon), with my zipper.  I couldn't get it zipped.  We attributed that to the fact that I'd stretched out a little bit in zero gravity.  And I'd had the suit fitted so tight that I just couldn't get the zipper closed.  You know, it's like stuffing a zippered suitcase so full you can't get it (closed).  Same deal.  And also, at this point, there was a crinkle back in the back of it - across the back - so that the zipper, instead of laying straight like that, it was like this?
117:12:39||alsj|Like many Southerners, Charlie tends to turn statements - like the last sentence of the previous paragraph -  into a question, basically asking if I was understanding him.
117:12:39|Jones|alsj|Bent a little bit, like a finger crooked.
117:12:39|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And you couldn't get it around there.  So you had to hold it closed, then you needed another hand to pull the zipper, then you needed another hand to straighten the crook.
117:12:39|Jones|alsj|So, did the two of you...
117:12:39|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we did.  I've forgotten how we did that, but John finally got it done.
117:13:22||alsj|Had they landed on time and done the first EVA before having a rest period, they would have waited until EVA-2 wake-up to replace the ECS primary cartridge with a fresh one stowed behind the ascent engine cover. (See a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a16/LM11-co3lbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from an Apollo 16 LM-close-out picture. Because of the landing delay and the decision to postpone EVA-1 till after the first rest period, it is now time to make the rpelacement.  They will bring up another primary canister before the end of the EVA and will make another change after EVA-2 wake-up.
117:14:18||alsj|Rather than use the Lunar Surface Checklist in book form, they have mounted two large <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16PrepPost.html" target="new" target="alsj">cue cards</A> on the instrument panel that has the steps listed on both sides.  By using the cards, they won't have to turn pages as often.  The second card includes post-EVA procedures.  They have a pair of cards for each of the EVAs and one for the contingency of a One-Man EVA in the case that one of the PLSSs is inoperable.
117:14:24||alsj|Each side of each card has three columns of procedures. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" titlle="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 1 Side 1</a> has Equipment Preparation in column 1 and the first part of EVA-1 Preps in the other two columns.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card1Side2.jpg" titlle="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 1 Side 2</a> continues with three more columns of EVA-1 Preps. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" titlle="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a> has two final columns of EVA-1 preps on the left and the first part of EVA-1 post in the column on the right. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" titlle="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 2</a> completes the listing of post-eva procedures.
117:16:11||alsj|Before Charlie removes the used Primary cartridge, they <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ECS-LiOH-Canister-Select.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">switch the ECS canister selector</a> from Primary to Secondary, directing airflow into the smaller cartridge. Once the new Primary cartridge was been installed, they will switch back to Primary.
117:16:56||alsj|Tony isn't being very clear, but he is referring to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">back of the second card</a>, which contains both EVA-1 Prep and EVA-1 Post procedures on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">front</a> and EVA-1 Post procedures on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">back</a>.
117:17:54||alsj|John's next transmission suggests that, while John is marking the checklist changes, he is also watching and/or helping Charlie change the LiOH canister on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a>.
117:19:04|Duke|alsj|What he's really talking about is 'Get everything done, you guys, before we start suiting up.
117:23:46||alsj|The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../CAM-DataFile140.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">data file</a> is located behind John's station, on the leftside bulkhead above the place on the wall where his PLSS is stowed when not in use.  LInked photo taken in 2002 by Frank O'Brien of a LM simulator at the Cradle of Aviation Museum.  A mock-up of a CDR PLSS is below the data file compartment.  The front of the cabin is on the right.]</i></blockquote>
117:24:59||alsj|They are now getting John into his suit.  They are not yet on the Cue Cards.
117:35:58||alsj|However, before they don the PLSSs, they have to do the steps on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf2-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 2-5</a> of the LM Lunar Surface Checklist.  On several of the missions, the astronauts called the CapCom &quot;Hank&quot;, it usually was in retaliation because the CapCom has just used the wrong name.  Here, however, it doesn't appear that Tony made a mistake.
117:35:58||alsj|Journal Contributor David Harland notes that, had they landed on schedule, they wouldn't have needed to don the suits.  They started <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new" target="alsj">donning the suits</a> at about  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1wake.html#1164216" target="new" target="alsj"> 116:42:16</a> and most of the hour's worth of effort since then can be thought of as a secondary cost of the landing delay.]</i></blockquote>
117:38:39||alsj|Here, they are checking the tank pressures on the Oxygen Purge Systems (OPSs), the emergency oxygen supplies worn on the top of the PLSSs.  This step is 2/3rds of the way down the lefthand column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 1 Side 1</a>.  As they will soon discover, they have gotten out of sequence. Given the number of changes dictated by the delayed landing, things have gone quite smoothly.
117:38:39|Duke|tech|I'd like to say 'attaboy' right now for John Covington coming up with those new procedures.  The Lunar Surface checklist, his part of it, was just outstanding.  It was reorganized in real time and we never had a feeling that we were pillar-to-post in that checklist.  We had to flip pages, but it was all flowing well and, once we got on it, it led us right back to where we were back in sync by the time we got the prep card that we used - the cue card (which is where they are now).  He had done a lot.  Those things were well organized and I thought those set of procedures for the preps and posts flowed as smooth as glass.
117:40:07||alsj|This statement is a little puzzling in light of the conversation at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1wake.html#1155028" target="new" target="alsj">115:50:28</a> which indicated that a site handover - from Australia to Spain - had taken place at about 115:30.]</i></blockquote>
117:45:34||alsj|John has noticed that they have skipped some of the steps in the left-hand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 1 Side 1</a>.
117:46:35|Duke|alsj|When we're getting these suits on, it's like the Keystone Kops in there.  'Oh, wait a minute, let me bend this way.'  It was terrible.  And that's the way it had been when we practiced.  We ended up having to help one another and getting frustrated with one another.
117:46:35|Jones|alsj|I gather that, with a little bit more floor area, it would have been a piece of cake.&quot;]
117:46:35|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
117:47:58||alsj|It sounds like they are getting Charlie's EVA boots on.]</i></blockquote>
117:49:30|Jones|alsj|Any theories about why the word 'okay' is the most frequently spoken word on the lunar surface.
117:49:30||alsj|Duke - (Laughing) &quot;No.  In this case, right in here, we're going through everything and, as you do your deals, 'okay, it's working.'  You use it like that.&quot;]
117:49:30||alsj|In the following, they are probably cleaning the orange juice out of the helmets.]</i></blockquote>
118:05:11||alsj|While it is possible that they are taking drinks from the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../water_gun.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">water gun</a> (photo by Mick Hyde), during the Technical Debrief John indicated that they frequently ran water through the LCGs to keep themselves cool.
118:05:11|Young|tech|Let me say something about the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new" target="alsj">donning and doffing</a>.  We used a different procedure than that in the timeline in regard to coolant.  We used only Lunar Module (water) for cooling during donning and doffing and we only used the LCG pump.  We got the other hoses out of the way and sort of semi-stowed.  We didn't say anything (to Houston) about changing those procedures in real time, but it kept us significantly more hydrated than we would have been had we been on air coolant.  What we would do is we plugged into the (LM) water and got it running through our suits, cooled the LCG down, and then climbed into the pressure suit, which took a big chunk of energy.  And then, immediately, plugged the water in (again) and pushed the (LCG) pump (circuit breaker) in and gave it a squirt of water.  At various intervals, when we started to feel like we were running out of cooling, we'd push the pump (breaker) in for maybe 30 seconds worth, give it a squirt of water, and not use air coolant all the time that we were donning and doffing.  I'm sure that's the best way to work that system, because it keeps you from sweating.  It keeps you from doing the kind of (air) cooling that must dehydrate you.
118:05:11|Slayton|tech|You didn't run the pump continuously, though.
118:05:11|Young|tech|No.  I think I'm going to recommend that they change the procedures to do it this way.  I first noticed this when we were running (that is, conducting) long durations of suit runs (in training) and we only had air coolant.  You really feel bad after you finish a long duration of suit run with only air coolant.  If you run with water coolant, you feel okay.  Now, I don't know why that is, but it sure is a fact.  Because (after) 5 hours of running in the suit with just air coolant, you suffer the next day.  (After) five hours of water coolant down at the Cape training, you can go the next day and run another one.  You don't feel like (doing) it very much, but you can do it.  I think it may be a difference that, if you can keep your body from sweating, you sure should do it; and running that water coolant for donning and doffing was ideal; plus, it had the added advantage of getting those two, big, long, cumbersome (oxygen) hoses out of the way, which were right in the traffic area.  That (meaning having the oxygen hoses in the way) is really a son-of-a-gun when it comes to doing things like changing comm out in the Lunar Module.  And we made that change (in procedures) in real time because it was actually like we practiced in the (LM cabin) mock-up down at the Cape.  I sure think it paid off.  I think it's a better way to do it.  I just don't think long-duration air coolant in the pressure suit - which we were in a lot of the time - makes your body sweat and you have to replenish the water by drinking it.  You don't always have time to think about doing that.  It may be a significant factor in getting the crew back hydrated, as opposed to being dehydrated.
118:05:11||alsj|A comparison of pages 2-9 in both the <a href="a16surf2-8_9.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 16</a> and <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17LMLunarSurf2-9.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 17</a> checklists indicate that John's suggestion was adopted.  On Apollo 17, the LM oxygen hoses were disconnected at the bottom of the left-hand column on 2-9 and the LM water hoses weren't disconnected until the bottom of the right-hand column.
118:05:58||alsj|Now they will get Charlie's PLSS on.  John's &quot;sure makes a difference&quot; in his next transmission may be another reference to the ease of lifting things in one-sixth g.
118:05:58||alsj|Although there is no mention of the fact in the transcripts, Houston did a clock update at 118:06:31.  Subsequent times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times.
118:11:26||alsj|Next, John will don his own PLSS.
118:19:46||alsj|John's next transmission suggests that he has hit his circuit breaker panel  ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-CB11.html" target="new" target="alsj">CB(11)</a> ) with his PLSS.  The breaker in question is the second one in from the left side in the middle row on Surface checklist <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 1-4</a>.  It is supposed to be in (that is, closed).
118:21:48||alsj|They will now configuring John's Audio, as per th fourth paragraph in right-hand column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 1 Side 1</a>.
118:26:19||alsj|Here, John connects his PLSS comm.
118:31:44||alsj|John and Charlie have been through these procedures often enough that Charlie is anticipating John's words.
118:31:57||alsj|They have shut down the fan that moves oxygen through the ECS Suit Circuit and have shut off a differential pressure (Delta-P) sensor that would have warned them that the fan was not running.
118:32:11||alsj|With the fan off, there is no air flow to drive the water separator and, once the centrifuge in the separator spins down, a warning light will come on.
118:32:55||alsj|The water separator has spun down.
118:33:29||alsj|As shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A14EMUHandbookV1FI-23.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">Figure I-23</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A14EMU-v1.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">EMU Handbook</a>, the diverter valve is part of the oxygen inflow connector and gives them the option of directing the  PLSS oxygen flow entirely into the helmet (the vertical position) or partly  into the suit torso (the horizontal position).  Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso.  In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.
118:33:42||alsj|Now they will install John's purge valve.
118:33:58||alsj|They are probably talking about running water through the LCGs again.
118:35:08||alsj|John is saying that it was a good idea to run the LCG pump occasionally.
118:36:11||alsj|In the following transmission, Charlie suggests that they leave the water on for a while.
118:36:43||alsj|During this interval, we can hear clacking noises which indicate that one of them, possibly John, is getting his helmet on.  I think that John already has his helmet on because the dialog from here to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1183855" target="new" target="alsj">118:38:55</a> seems to concern only Charlie's helmet and, after that point, there is no doubt that they both have their helmets on.
118:36:43|Jones|alsj|Ideally, you each got your own helmet on?
118:36:43|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
118:38:46||alsj|Although the comm may have been good in the spacecraft, the audio tape in Houston is difficult to understand and I have no doubt that transcription errors remain.]</i></blockquote>
118:39:08||alsj|With the suits and PLSS on, it would be all but impossible to get the gloves off the floor.
118:39:10||alsj|John's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LEVA.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEVA</a> has a red strip that runs back from the top-center of the faceplate.  The stripe - along with similar red stripes on his arms and legs - make it relatively easy to tell John and Charlie apart in the TV and photographs.  Jim Lovell was the first of the Commanders to have red stripes on his suit.
118:40:40||alsj|Evidently, John had turned to face his circuit breaker panel so that Charlie could secure his  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LEVA.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEVA</a> in the back.]</i></blockquote>
118:41:17||alsj|Now, Charlie will secure John's tool-harness straps.]</i></blockquote>
118:41:55||alsj|John's LM water hose extends from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a> behind Charlie over to John's side of the spacecraft and he is probably putting it back on the engine cover.
118:42:08||alsj|Charlie is fitting the ends of the LM water hoses into some fitting on the wall.
118:42:37||alsj|Charlie has just hooked up John's PLSS water hose.]</i></blockquote>
118:43:17||alsj|They have verified that the suit diverter valve is vertical.  With the valve in this position, they will get oxygen flow into the helmet.]
118:43:17|Duke|alsj|It had a vertical and a horizontal position.  You'd put it vertical and all the flow would go to the helmet; and that's what you wanted.  You could go to horizontal and part of the flow would go to the torso and part to the helmet.  But it was always nice to have it in vertical because it'd flow over and wash out the helmet; and it was a lot cooler with all the oxygen going to the helmet rather than into the torso.&quot;]
118:43:17|Jones|alsj|Now, later on, would you have switched it over to horizontal to clean out water vapor or sweat?&quot;]
118:43:17|Duke|alsj|We could have but I don't think we did.
118:43:17|Jones|alsj|The oxygen's coming in through the connectors on the chest, but then there would have been some tubing to send it up to vents...&quot;]
118:43:17|Duke|alsj|Right at the back of the helmet.  There was a big space (about 4 inches left to right by a quarter inch deep) and it would flow right up over the back of the head, around and down the front of the helmet.&quot;]
118:43:17|Jones|alsj|And then it would go down through the neckring and exit the suit somewhere in the torso.&quot;]
118:43:17|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
118:43:23||alsj|The circuit breaker configurations are those shown on surface checklist pages <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1-4 and 1-5</a>.
118:43:53||alsj|Readers should remember that the comm is poor because of the need to conserve power so that a third EVA will be possible.  The poor comm not only caused Tony's mis-identification but, for someone without the checklists, makes this part of the mission very hard to follow.
118:44:00||alsj|These are fingerless cover gloves - rather like golf gloves - used to protect the EVA gloves from abrasion during the ALSEP deployment. In the transmission at 118:44:00, we can hear Charlie straining as he reaches back to get the cover gloves, which may be on the stowage shelf on the back wall.
118:44:45||alsj|Charlie thinks he may have dropped one of the cover gloves.
118:44:45|Duke|alsj|It would have been real tough to get it.  It really was. It was really crowded.
118:45:17||alsj|Charlie may have found the missing cover glove inside the corresponding EVA glove.
118:47:21||alsj|John is jumping the gun.  They still need to verify the wrist locks and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../glove.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">glove straps</a> and the other steps at the top of the lefhand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a>.
118:47:42||alsj|They each wore a wrist watch over the glove gauntlets.  The PLSS diverter valves control the rate of flow of water into the PLSS sublimator and, hence, the level of cooling.
118:48:10||alsj|They have not yet started the flow of sublimator feedwater but, rather, have started the flow of water through the LCGs.
118:48:13||alsj|They are now starting the pressure integrity check starting at the middle of the lefthand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a>.
118:48:13|Duke|tech|(The) EVA Prep, PLSS donning, and checkout went great.  That little beauty is just what we expected.  It worked just like the procedures - followed straight through.  We felt as if we were on time during the whole donning.
118:48:13|Young|tech|Yes, we didn't think we were behind anywhere.
118:48:13|Duke|tech|We didn't have a clock to see.
118:48:13|Young|tech|What we had planned to do, pre-flight, was to have the mission timer running and we had our timeline blocked out so that, for each sequence that took, say, 20 minutes, we'd know where we were in the timeline and we wouldn't have to keep bugging the ground.  They wouldn't have to keep bugging us, either, to speed up or slow down.  We didn't have to do anything over.
118:48:13||alsj|As an indication of their rate of progress, they started &quot;Equipment Prep EVA-1&quot; at the top of the lefthand column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card1Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 1 Side 1</a> at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1173635" target="new" target="alsj">117:36:35</a>.  They had planned to spend one hour eighteen minutes getting from that point to the start of the Pressure Integrity Check and, in fact, have only taken one hour twelve minutes.
118:48:15||alsj|The control that will start the oxygen flow is on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../plss103.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">bottom, right, forward corner of the PLSS</a> and, in the cramped cabin, is difficult to reach.  A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../plss09.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">close-up photograph</a> of an <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../plss.html" target="new" target="alsj">engineering model of the PLSS at NASA Johnson</a> shows the location of the control, which is between controls for the feedwater diverter valve (closer to the camera) and the water shut-off valve (farthest from the camera). The controls have different shapes to make them easier to distinguish by feel when reaching back with a gloved right hand.]
118:48:15|Young|tech|Sometimes Charlie and I could reach the valve on the PLSS and sometimes we couldn't; and there didn't seem to be a reason why.  But, in the main, we tried to help each other in the vehicle to turn the oxygen on and off.
118:48:35||alsj|I am not certain that I transcribed Charlie's transmission correctly at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1184805" target="new" target="alsj">118:48:05</a>; but it is certainly true that the small, recessed flag windows on the top of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> were difficult to see.]</i></blockquote>
118:49:07||alsj|Here, John is combining the information in the first three lines in the pressure integrity check.
118:49:52||alsj|They will turn off the oxygen for one minute and watch the suit pressure decay due to small leaks, breathe-down, and flow into nooks and crannies in the suit.  A decrease of 0.2 psi in one minute is normal and up to 0.3 psi is acceptable.
118:50:57||alsj|The unpressurized suit hangs on the body and, despite the low gravity, presses into the wearer at various places.
118:51:43|Duke|alsj|I thought I had it on; it didn't look like I had it on; he said 'it's not on'.  I don't remember how you could tell it was on; by oxygen flow or something.&quot;]
118:51:43|Jones|alsj|Could you feel it on the back of your head, even with the Snoopy cap on?&quot;]
118:51:43|Duke|alsj|Yeah, a little bit.  But you could feel it more coming down over your face.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
118:52:10||alsj|Charlie strains as he turns to face his circuit breaker panel, CB(16).
118:52:41||alsj|Prior crews had used the dump valve in the forward hatch to do the depressurization.  In order to do that, the LMP had to back up as far as possible and bend down to get the valve, which was not an easy task in a pressurized suit.  Here, Charlie is turning so that he can get his left arm up to the dump valve in the overhead hatch.  The Apollo 16 and 17 crews used only the overhead valve.
118:52:41|Jones|alsj|On 17 Gene and Jack had to jockey positions fairly carefully.  Gene was the one who went up for the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../DumpValve.html" target="new" target="alsj">dump valve</a>, because he's taller.  And, to get his right arm up, he had to get around with his PLSS to the circuit breaker panel.  Do you remember anything about how you did it.
118:52:41|Duke|alsj|I reached that for John.  I'm left handed, and I remember it was right up in here somewhere.  I didn't have any problem.  I just reached up and got it.  I think I might have had to stand up on my tiptoes.
118:52:41|Jones|alsj|Facing more or less inboard, I would imagine.
118:52:41|Duke|alsj|Right (correct).  Uh-huh.  Well, sort of inboard, sort of 45 degrees (facing the left-front corner) so that you can get your arm up.
118:52:41|Jones|alsj|There was a little locking pin on the valve.  Did you have to get that out.
118:52:41|Duke|alsj|That might have been it.
118:52:41|Jones|alsj|'Cause I don't remember any discussion of getting that pin out first.
118:52:41|Duke|alsj|That's probably what I'm talking about (at 118:52:41).
118:52:41|Duke|tech|We used the overhead valve and it was horrible to reach in training; but, in one-sixth gravity, it was nothing: just (reached) right up there and got it.  I really felt familiar with those procedures.  That 'square-filling' we did (in training) really paid off, I'll tell you.
118:52:41||alsj|In order to maintain proficiency, pilots make flights on a routine basis in which they perform various procedures and maneuvers so that they don't get rusty.  A record is maintained of the procedures that they have practiced in a given week or month and, after each proficiency flight, the appropriate squares on the form are checked - the square is filled.
118:52:57||alsj|With the cabin pressure at 3.5 psi, they have closed the dump valve.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a> indicates that they were to put the dump valve in Auto.  In that position, the valve would only dump oxygen if the cabin pressure exceeded 5.4 psi.  They will put the valve in the Open position as soon as they finish the pressure integrity check so, in this circumstance, the difference between Auto and Close is of no consequence.
118:52:57||alsj|Because of the lower cabin pressure, the relative pressure in the suit has increased and they will watch their cuff gauges to make sure that the suit pressure has risen as expected and is decaying due to breathe-down.  There is a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../emu_suit pressure_gauge.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">relief valve in the suit</a> which opens if the pressure rises into the range 4.8 to 5.5 psi.
118:53:32||alsj|The EVA starts as soon as Charlie re-opens the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../DumpValve.html" target="new" target="alsj">dump valve</a>.  John and Charlie will use their watches to gauge the EVA elapsed time for comparison with the time markers in the cuff checklists.  They are each wearing an Omega <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../omega.html" target="new" target="alsj">Speedmaster Professional</a> on a long strap that fits around the forearm. They are at 102:25 in the middle column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a>.
118:53:32|Jones|alsj|Did you use the stopwatch function, or set it to twelve or something?
118:53:32|Duke|alsj|You just started your stopwatch.  That's what we did.
118:53:32|Jones|alsj|You've got the gloves on.  Any particular problem with starting the stopwatch?
118:53:32|Duke|alsj|No.  That Omega had a little button at the top...It would be difficult to wind a watch; but, to start the watch, you hit that and it started the stop watch.
118:53:32||alsj|Photo AS16-117-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18826" target="new" target="alsj">18826</a> shows John at Station 10-prime, late in EVA-3, wearing his Omega Speedmaster Professional strapped over his right gauntlet.  It reads 1:20, which is Houston time.  
118:53:32|Jones|alsj|Gene said that he wore a mirror (on the suit sleeve)...
118:53:32|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we did.
118:53:32|Jones|alsj|And what did you use that for?
118:53:32|Duke|alsj|To shine into areas to read checklists and things that were difficult to read for some reason.  Like decals and things on experiments that you could get under to read it, so you'd use the mirror so you could look in.  And we used it to shine light into a dark area.  Just things like that.
118:53:32|Jones|alsj|Would you have used it to look at anything on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a>?
118:53:32|Duke|alsj|No.  That was all up on the top.
118:53:32|Jones|alsj|Look at connectors?
118:53:32|Duke|alsj|Yeah, you could have.  There was a lot of uses for it.  I don't remember any specific times doing that.
118:53:32||alsj|A search of the stowage lists shows that only the A16 and A17 LM crews had wrist mirrors, perhaps because of a comment Dave Scott made at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15eva1prep.html#1194248" target="new" target="alsj">119:42:48</a>during the Apollo 15 hatch opening for EVA-1: &quot;Yeah, I got it open.  But I wish I had a mirror.  (Long Pause)  I feel like I'm caught on something!&quot;. See a discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.eva3prep.html#1631953" target="new" target="alsj">163:19:53</a> in the A17LSJ.
118:54:01||alsj|Because the PLSS sublimator will only operate in a vacuum, they won't turn the sublimator feedwater on until the hatch is open.  The appearance of an &quot;A&quot; flag in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> water window confirms both that the feedwater is off and that the sensor is working.
118:55:07||alsj|If the hatch swung shut, with both valves Closed or in Auto, and there was a leak of oxygen into the cabin, they wouldn't be able to open the hatch until they bled the cabin pressure by opening the forward valve with a control mounted on the outside.  Under normal circumstances, that wouldn't be a problem.  If they were in a hurry because of a suit leak, they would be in trouble.
118:55:09||alsj|John has to back up as far as possible and bend down to get the handle on the hatch.
118:55:46|Mattingly|tech|Did you have a lot of stuff come out of the hatch like we had (during equalization of the LM and CSM cabin pressures)?
118:55:46|Duke|tech|No, we saw a few dust particles fly out, but that was all.  To do the actual depress, we used the overhead valve and just left it open.  I never noticed much floating (up) that way.  The LM was extremely clean.  You know how many screws and little washers and things we found floating in the Command Module.  I guess, maybe, we found five in the LM the whole time.
118:55:46|Young|tech|It was extremely clean until after the first EVA and, from then on, it was really dirty.
118:55:46|Duke|alsj|John opened it.  We just practiced that way.  He opened it and then I took over and pulled it over in front of my feet.  And when we opened it, you can see what I commented here.  Boy, I tell you the dust and debris and everything just streamed out the hatch.  I mean, even though it was down to what we thought was a vacuum, it wasn't.  The lunar module was still outgassing a lot.
118:55:53||alsj|They have started the tasks under Final Prep for Egress at the bottom of the middle column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a>.
118:55:58||alsj|Charlie is trying to turn on John's feedwater.  The feedwater on/off valve is the rightmost of the three controls on the bottom of the PLSS and is the hardest to reach, especially with the suit at greater than the normal working pressure of 3.8 psi.  Each of the controls has a distinct shape so that they can be distinguished by feel.]</i></blockquote>
118:56:38|Young|tech|As everybody (on the other LM crews) has remarked, once you get the gear on, the only thing you can do is get out of the spacecraft, because you've run out of room to do anything else.
118:56:38|Duke|alsj|We were sort of running into one another at this point.  You can tell we're getting a little frustrated.
118:56:38|Jones|alsj|It's a real broom closet in there, I gather.  And that's mostly because of the constraints of the Saturn V, isn't it?&quot;]
118:56:38|Duke|alsj|I don't remember what was the design constraint on the Lunar Module.  I don't think it was the Saturn.  It was more just the weight of things.  Well, of course, it had to fit into the slot of the LM adapter (just below the Service Module near the top of the Apollo stack).  And then, of course, there was a weight limit on how much you could carry down.
118:56:38|Jones|alsj|And volume does cost you a little bit.
118:56:38|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  So, it was okay.  We got used to it.  This first time was the hard part and then, after that, it got better.&quot;]
118:56:38||alsj|Journal Contributor David Harland calls attention to a discussion of the dimensions of the Saturn V and, hence, of the CSM and LM, on page 166 of  Mike Gray's </i>Angle of Attack: Harrison Storms and the Race to the Moon<i>.
118:56:38|Jones|alsj|Would it be fair to describe it as 'barely adequate'?&quot;]
118:56:38|Duke|alsj|I wouldn't want it any smaller.  Let me put it that way. Yeah.
118:56:38|Jones|alsj|A little bit larger would have helped.
118:56:38|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Or the PLSS controls in a different spot;  that would have helped.  It was hard to get back over here with your arm.  With a proper design on the...I think the design was good; I'm not saying it wasn't good, 'cause the thing worked </i>great<i> once you got it going. But it was just hard to reach those switches in a confined environment.
118:56:38|Jones|alsj|Could you get the switches while you were on the Rover?
118:56:38|Duke|alsj|It was easier.  For some reason the (feed)water (control) - Min, Max, Medium - was okay; that was the only one we ever touched.  I went to Aux water once, I think, on the first EVA.  Yeah, I didn't seem to have any trouble once I got outside.
118:57:21||alsj|The sublimator contains a porous metal plate on which a layer of feedwater ice forms.  Heat transferred from the closed-loop water supply that flows through the LCG causes the outer layer of ice to sublimate, carrying off heat.  It takes a few minutes for the ice layer to form.  A rise in feedwater pressure indicates that fact.  It is the total amount of available feedwater and the rate at which it is used that is the main determinant of the length of an EVA.
118:57:33||alsj|Because of the need to save power, the high-bit rate that Houston would need to get PLSS telemetry is not available.
118:57:33|Jones|alsj|The way I understand it is that you're still at low bit rate, here, to conserve power.  They're not getting telemetry, and that's mostly because of transmitter power.  There's still telemetry coming out of the PLSS but the LM isn't able to send it.
118:57:33|Duke|alsj|Apparently so.  I don't remember.  'Cause, once we got on the surface, they had everything - once we got the LCRU up.
118:57:46||alsj|This is the gold-coated outer visor that provides protection from solar ultraviolet.
118:58:51||alsj|The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jettison bag</a> may be on the engine cover at this point and, because John and Charlie fill virtually the whole forward part of the cabin now that their suits are inflated, it would be all but impossible to get the jett bag to the hatch.
118:58:51||alsj|In the following, John refers to the &quot;second jettison&quot; but probably means this jettison following the first rest period.  Had they landed on schedule, they would have done a jettison at the start of EVA-1 and the one after the first rest period would have been the &quot;second jettison&quot;.  The Buddy SLSS - or BSLSS - is a set of hoses which would allow the crew to share cooling water in the event that one of them had a PLSS failure.  The BSLSS was taken to the Moon inside the cabin and the BSLSS bag was its stowage bag.
118:58:51|Young|tech|For the second jettison, we loaded up the Buddy SLSS bag.  In training, the Buddy SLSS bag had been adequate.  Unfortunately, nobody had counted on us landing, eating a night's food, getting up the next morning, eating a breakfast, and then trying to stow all those food wrappings in the Buddy SLSS bag.  We just barely jammed all that stuff in there.  It was really overly full.  To tie the bag up, we finally ended up wrapping tape around it.  It was really a marginal operation.  Plus, the other <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jett bag</a> would give you something to stand on (to avoid dust on the floor).  I don't think the Buddy SLSS bag makes a very good jettison bag.  It just wasn't big enough for the volume we had to put in it on the second jettison.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
118:59:08||alsj|In order to get out, John has to be facing the right rear so that he can lower himself toward the floor and get his feet out through the hatch.  Once he gets to his knees, he will move to his left to get centered and then will back out slowly under the DSKY.
||alsj|John and Charlie have completed all the procedures on the EVA Prep cue card and are now using their cuff checklists.  John is on page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp041.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-4</a> and Charlie on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev104.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-4</a> but, as indicated in the following dialog, John hasn't yet read his and is going on memory.]
|Jones|alsj|A lot of the time, you seem to be taking the traffic-controller role.&quot;]
|Duke|alsj|Yeah; I did.
|Jones|alsj|Any comment?  Personalities?
|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Personalities more than anything.
|Jones|alsj|John plays the country boy...
|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  Just the way we were, personality wise.  It just worked out that way; and John liked it and I did, too.  I think I had, probably, a little more attention to the detailed procedure than John...He had so much on his mind:  the overall mission planning and overall knowledge of the Command Module and those kind of major - let me call them strategic decisions and thinking - whereas I was more of a detail person.  So, when we got down into this detailed stuff, that's where it came out.  John had real good knowledge of the procedures and the overall thing but, down to the detail, nitty gritty, I was the guy responsible.  That's the way we trained.  Ken was responsible for the command ship.  So that comes out in a way that looks like I'm the traffic cop; but that's because it was what we had trained for.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:00:40||alsj|John is about to start the intricate process of getting out the hatch. The small area available to the crew at the front of the cabin is best illustrated by images taken during final Apollo 16 (LM 11, Orion) and Apollo 17 (LM 12, Challenger) LM close-out on the pad at the Cape prior to launch.
119:00:40||alsj|A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a16/LM11-co42.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">view from above</a> shows the LMP's PLSS (without the OPS) and two helmet bags (containing the LEVAs) filling the space.  As detailed on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LM04_Lunar_Module_ppLV1-17.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">pages LV-4 and 5</a> in the Lunar Module News Reference, the useable floor area measures about 55 inches (140 cm) from side to side and about 36 inches (91 cm) from the hatch to the base of the 18-inch (46 cm) 'midstep' behind the crew stations.  Note that the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Apollo_PLSS_Dimensions.tif" target="new" target="alsj">PLSS dimensions</a> are about 26 inches (66 cm) long, 19 inches (48 cm) wide, 9.5 (24 cm) inches thick at the base, and 8.75 (22 cm) inches thick at the top.  The photographer was standing on the midstep, with its edge near the bottom of the frame.
119:00:42||alsj|Compared to some of the other Commanders, John seems to have very little difficulty getting down to his hands and knees and out the hatch.
119:00:42|Young|tech|When our coolant became adequate, Charlie talked me out the door.  I guess I had a little more trouble with the line-up than you did, (Charlie).&quot;]
119:00:42|Duke|tech|It is because of the hatch.  The hatch is only about three-quarters open.  I can't back up any more.  Once you get the hatch full open, you can get centered in the hatchway.  I could do it (being the only person in the cabin), but you couldn't.&quot;]
119:00:42|Young|tech|I never had any concern about getting in or out.  It was just a question of knowing what I was going to get caught on.&quot;]
119:00:42|Jones|alsj|Do you remember anything specific about the hassle of getting John down low enough to get out the hatch?
119:00:42|Duke|alsj|It was difficult.  You had to get under the computer table and he had to sort of squat down and reach over sort of like this with his right hand.  We were like two bulls in a china shop there at first.  You'd bend over and that PLSS comes over and hits...And I had to get out of the way.  And I had to look to help guide him, because it was difficult for him to see; so I had to be back against the right wall and, once the PLSS is on, you know, if you turn sideways...Well you couldn't get over far enough if you were facing front, so you had to turn sideways and bend over and just had to figure out how you could look down in there.  We practiced a lot and, to be honest, it was more difficult down on Earth than it was up there because of the one g.  The only thing that the one-sixth g did for us was it was difficult to bend the suit.  Down on Earth with one g, you know, you had the weight helping you and the weight of the PLSS.  But, up there, it was just your own strength.  So, you now, we were rattling around a little bit; but it worked.&quot;]
119:00:42||alsj|Charlie's remark about the difficulty of getting his head positioned so that he could see John triggered a question about his ability to move his head inside the helmet.]
119:00:42|Jones|alsj|Could you move your head much side to side inside the bubble?
119:00:42|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  You had quite a bit range in there.  I can remember that I could turn my head around in the helmet.  It had a pad in it and you could turn around and sort of scratch your nose on the side of the pad.&quot;]
119:00:42||alsj|Nose-scratching pads were added around the rim of feed port inside the bubble helmets for Apollo 16 and 17. See <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/images17.html#72H1462" target="new" target="alsj">photos</a> from suit-up for the Apollo 17 Countdown Demonstration Test (CDDT).
119:00:42||alsj|The helmets also had a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../helmet.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">valsalva device</a> at the left side of the neckring.  This was a raised rubber fixture which the astronaut could use to block a nostril to clear the other one.  And, of course, it could be used for nose scratching.  There is a piece of film in NASA's Apollo 11 movie &quot;Eagle has Landed&quot; in which Neil Armstrong is shown trying out the Valsalva device during pre-mission suit donning.]</i></blockquote>
119:02:43||alsj|Charlie turns the 16-mm movie camera on and we see the left side of John's suit as he makes his way down the ladder.  The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jett bag</a> is lying on the ground at the north edge of the LM shadow.
119:03:19||alsj|Prior crews used a clothesline-like device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a11/a11.lec.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LEC</a>) to raise and lower the ETB and other pieces of equipment.  In using the LEC, the Commander stood at the bottom of the ladder, took hold of the LEC, backed away from the spacecraft to pull the LEC taut and then he and the LMP would move whatever piece of equipment was attached to the LEC up and down.  By the time of Apollo 16, the astronauts had decided that the LEC was more trouble than it was worth.  It sprayed dust all over the Commander and took a good deal of time and effort to operate.  On Apollo 14, Ed Mitchell started carrying some gear up the ladder and, for Apollo 16, John and Charlie have abandoned the clothesline LEC entirely.  In it's place, they have a simple lanyard with a hook so they can raise and lower the ETB - with its delicate load of cameras - over the side porch rail.
119:03:19|Jones|alsj|I gather John is hooking the ETB on the new LEC and lowering down to the ground.  Do you remember any pre-flight discussions about the change in the LEC?  The 15 guys were still using it in the clothesline mode.&quot;]
119:03:19|Duke|alsj|We didn't do that.  No, I don't remember anything out of the ordinary.  In fact, I don't remember John lowering the ETB to the ground like that.  But, apparently he did.  I thought he just kept it in his hands and walked down the ladder with it.  Towards the end of the EVAs, he could do that.  I mean, he'd go up the ladder with a rock box in his hand.  What we did is, we just hung things from the side and, once we got up on the top of the ladder, we just reached over and pulled it up with the rope.
119:03:19|Jones|alsj|Obviously, you decided that the clothesline thing was more trouble than it was worth.&quot;]
119:03:19|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
119:03:19|Jones|alsj|Ed Mitchell (on Apollo 14) was the first one to carry things up by hand; but they still used the clothesline LEC for some things.&quot;]
119:03:19|Duke|alsj|I don't think we did.  I can't ever remember getting that thing hooked up inside.&quot;]
119:03:19|Jones|alsj|But you trained on it for 13.
119:03:19|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh.
119:03:19|Jones|alsj|There is a note in the technical debrief that you had adjusted the LEC so that the ETB would be hanging free so that it wouldn't get dirty; but, somehow, it didn't arrive at the Moon at that length.  Do you remember that?&quot;]
119:03:19|Duke|alsj|Yeah, I remember that, now.  And we were surprised.  You could tell by my voice that I was surprised.  And what was going through my mind then, maybe, was either we stroked the struts or something was adjusted wrong.
119:03:19|Young|tech|Once I got outside, I had our new LEC strap.  The (length) adjustment feature on that strap is at the top of it.  We marked it pre-flight how we wanted it adjusted.  I don't think it was (actually) adjusted that way because, when I lowered the ETB to the ground, it landed on the ground, and we were trying to avoid this.  We didn't want any dust on the ETB so we could keep the dust out of the cockpit.  We had to adjust it on the later EVA.  What I recommend is that they put the adjustment strap  on the bottom so, if you do land on a slope or if you land (hard) and you stroke a gear and you want to re-adjust the strap, you can adjust it to you eye level on the ground, and not while you are hanging on the ladder with one hand.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:03:26||alsj|John reaches out to his right and pulls the release lanyard.  We see the shadow of the MESA deploying.
119:03:40||alsj|The Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) contains tools, equipment, food packages, spare batteries, and other gear and is folded up against the side of the spacecraft to the left of the ladder as seen by someone looking at the spacecraft from the west.  The MESA is hinged at the bottom and, when John pulled on a release lanyard, the MESA swung down about 120 degrees to what would be a good working height if the LM were perfectly upright on a level surface.  John can adjust the MESA height once he gets down to the surface.
119:03:45|Jones|alsj|Were you watching him out the window?&quot;]
119:03:45|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  I was watching all that.
119:03:45|Jones|alsj|Could you see him on the porch?
119:03:45|Duke|alsj|Partly.  And then down the ladder.  And I saw the MESA go down.
119:03:54||alsj|We don't see any of John's climb down the ladder but, evidently, he steps off the footpad as he says 'Okay' and immediately comes into view on the north side of the ladder.
119:04:05||alsj|This is a reference to the Joel Chandler Harris story &quot;How Mr. Rabbit was too sharp for Mr. Fox&quot;.  In the story, Brer Rabbit has become entangled with the Tar Baby and is caught by Brer Fox.  Brer Fox thinks he might roast Brer Rabbit, who says, &quot;I don't care what you do with me, Brer Fox, just so you don't fling me in that briar patch.&quot; As it turns out, there is no firewood handy, so Brer Fox thinks about hanging Brer Rabbit, who says that would be much better than being thrown in the briar patch.  And so on.  On his fourth spaceflight, NASA has finally thrown John in the briar patch.
119:04:34|Young|tech|When I got down on the Moon, the environment was just as good as I thought it was going to be.  The second thing I did was reach down and pick up a rock, just to see if I could do it.  And, sure enough, that was a piece of cake; so I really thought we were going to be in business with that suit mobility.
119:04:54||alsj|There were probes hanging down from three of the four footpads to trigger the Contact light.  Each probe was 68 inches (1.73 meters) long.  No probe was put on the forward footpad to avoid interference with the crew going up and down the ladder.  During the landing, the probes bent as the spacecraft fell the last few feet to the surface; and the probe orientations were a good indication of spacecraft motions during the last seconds of the landing.]</i></blockquote>
119:05:11||alsj|John is talking about the twenty-five-meter crater he flew over during the final approach.  See pan frames AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17430" target="new" target="alsj">17430</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17436" target="new" target="alsj">17436</a>.] </i></blockquote>
119:05:13|Jones|alsj|I gather that it was easier for the LMPs to get out because you could get the hatch all the way open.&quot;]
119:05:13|Duke|alsj|No, I don't think it was any different.
119:05:13|Jones|alsj|Or was it just that there wasn't anybody in there talking about it.&quot;]
119:05:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  You just had to wiggle around a little bit.  I don't remember this time; but, some of the time, getting back in, he had to help guide me in, by standing on the surface looking up.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:05:36||alsj|None of the astronauts could explain why the hatch was pulled closed.  Neil Armstrong suggested that it was closed to avoid somebody asking them if they had been 'brought up in a barn', but there may also have been thermal reasons for closing it.  Readers may wish to note that Charlie is the only LMP who did not joke about &quot;not locking the hatch&quot; with them on the outside.]</i></blockquote>
119:05:41|Young|tech|I went around to the MESA and the first thing I noticed on the MESA was that the height was too low but I didn't do anything about it at the time.&quot;]
119:05:41||alsj|Note that they will not deploy the TV so that they can conserve LM electrical power.]</i></blockquote>
119:06:05||alsj|Note that Charlie is using the frame of reference they use in the cabin, with right being north.  In the Journal, I usually use the frame of reference of a person facing the spacecraft.]</i></blockquote>
119:06:24|Duke|tech|My egress went right by the checklist.  I came right on out.  It was even better than I expected and easier to do.  I felt right at home the minute I hit the ground.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:06:49|Duke|tech|My first job was to take out the drill and the core stems and I couldn't.  The way the MESA was hanging, you never would have gotten them out.  It was almost like you were looking at it flat (like a picture on a wall).  Normally, it sits up, but it was almost all the way down.&quot;]
119:06:49|Young|tech|The MESA was supposed to be adjusted to the green line and it wasn't adjusted to that green line. It was about 18 inches lower than the green line so the MESA (front bottom edge) was lying right on the ground.  Maybe this is a pre-flight problem. If it had been adjusted to the green line - which is where we adjusted it to - it would have been in perfect position.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:07:12|Jones|alsj|What can you tell me about how you adjusted the MESA?  Was there a strap or something you pulled?
119:07:12|Duke|alsj|Yeah. I've forgotten whether John held it up or I held it up; but we could just get under it and just pull it up like this and then there was a strap that you could pull in and that would hold it.  If I remember, there was two straps - maybe there might have only been one - but, as the thing came down, these straps got tight.  And we had adjusted it, hopefully, so we could sort of work at sort of desk level - you know, waist level.  But, for some reason, this thing got all the way down and we had to bend over and it was just too low.  So, we picked it up; and I held it up at about waist level, I remember - or John did - and then we just adjusted these straps and that held it in place.  And from then on it worked great; it was the right height so that we could reach back over and we could get the stuff in the front.&quot;]
119:07:12|Jones|alsj|Both of you seem to adapt to one-sixth g really quickly.&quot;]
119:07:12|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
119:07:12|Jones|alsj|Does anything particular that comes to mind about why the adaptation was so easy?
119:07:12|Duke|alsj|Well, I think the reason was that we were the fifth landing and we had all the experience of the other guys and watching them on the tapes and seeing that they didn't have any problem.  And we practiced in the one-sixth-g airplane, which was real (good training).  And after practicing there and watching what the other guys had done, we just knew we were going to be okay.  That the training was good.&quot;]
119:07:12|Jones|alsj|Did you have the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#POGO" target="new" target="alsj">POGO</a> - the strap contraption (in the centrifuge)?&quot;]
119:07:12|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh
119:07:12|Jones|alsj|Did that help?
119:07:12|Duke|alsj|Not so much.  Like I say, we used that when we jogged for that four hours or whatever it was.  But it had a tendency to hold you upright.  The one-sixth-g airplane was the best.
119:07:12|Jones|alsj|Even though that's only thirty seconds at a time?
119:07:12|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh.
119:07:17||alsj|Evidently, John has lifted the MESA and is holding it at what he thinks will be a good height.  Charlie will adjust the straps.]</i></blockquote>
119:10:37|Duke|alsj|It was just a bitch to get it adjusted.  I don't remember the details of the strap, but we couldn't get the strap to work, for some reason.  It sounds like we're a bunch of klutzes, that we hadn't practiced on it.  We had practiced the different cases.&quot;]
119:10:37|Jones|alsj|But apparently not for quite some time.
119:10:37|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Anyway, we overcame it; so I don't think it wasted too much time.&quot;]
119:10:37|Duke|tech|It was hanging down on about a 60-degree angle.  I looked like the 'spec high' case to me.  That is where the vehicle is high and you have to drop the MESA down to reach things.  It looks like you should pull the black strap to adjust it, because it has a pulley arrangement and you think that is the mechanical advantage.  You pull, and pull, and pull, and it is locked down.  The strap you want to pull is the green one up above.  This (green) strap has no mechanical advantage except the gravity field.  We finally figured that out after about 5 minutes.  We wasted 5 minutes.&quot;]
119:10:37|Young|tech|I recommend that they adjust it to the green line where it belongs; and that, late in the EVA training program, we (practice) adjust(ing) the MESA.  We had been checked out on how to raise and lower the MESA height, but I forgot how to do it.&quot;]
119:10:37|Duke|tech|We did it a long, long time ago.&quot;]
119:10:37|Young|tech|It was far back (in time) from where we did it the first time.&quot;]
119:10:37|Duke|tech|Maybe in training, Stoner and his people could give us various cases, instead of the flat-floor case, which we always get to keep you familiar with it - or put a decal on it that says 'pull here for adjustment'.  That snowed us.&quot;]
119:10:37|Young|tech|It not only snowed us, it snowed the ground, too.  It took them a while to figure out how to do it; and there's 5 minutes down the tubes.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:12:14||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev104.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-4</a>, Charlie will deploy a &quot;table&quot; on the MESA to hold a Sample Return Container (SRC or rock box), remove the Apollo Lunar Surface Drill (ALSD) and some core stems, and put the ETB on the MESA.  Normally, John would have deployed the tripod by this time and, in order to do his work, Charlie has to get the tripod out of the way.]</i></blockquote>
119:12:46||alsj|Houston sometimes used a request for an EMU check as a veiled request that the crew slow down - but not always.
119:12:46|Jones|alsj|Was this a request from Houston for you to slow down a touch?&quot;]
119:12:46|Duke|alsj|No. Not at this point.  It was a legitimate check.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:14:15||alsj|In the next section of the Journal, John will begin to off-load the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV).  That comes at 0+30 in his checklist.  The EVA started at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new" target="alsj">118:53:33</a>.  Although they lost some time because of the difficulty they had adjusting the MESA, John didn't have to deploy the TV and, consequently, they are about eight minutes ahead.]</i></blockquote>
119:15:21||alsj|Charlie carries the core stems to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> (north) footpad and that gives him a chance to take a closer look at the crater behind the spacecraft.
119:16:03|Young|tech|Inspection of the vehicle (meaning the Rover) showed that none of the things (wheels, chassis sections, etc.) had pre-deployed, to which I may add a hearty 'thank God'.
119:16:03||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-KSC-71P-543.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-543 </a> shows Charlie (foreground) and John (beyond the wheels) inspecting the Rover at the Cape on 12 November 1971 while it was being stowed on the Descent stage.  Charlie is standing at the hinge connecting the aft and center chassis sections.
119:16:43|Duke|tech|I was really expecting to see a 'remove before flight' pin up there, but there wasn't.  It was perfectly clean, but it just didn't work in yaw at all.
119:17:06|Young|tech|The walking hinges were released, just like on 15.  We had to put those back.
119:17:06||alsj|The walking hinges are fixtures on the outside of the LM that support the bottom of the Rover package.  As John and Charlie deploy the Rover, they will let the top part of the Rover package rotate out, away from the LM and, during that part of the deployment, the package pivots on the hinges.  On all three of the Rover missions, the Rover packages were found to be off the hinges, probably as a result of getting jarred during landing.  They were easily reset.  Don McMillan has provided an <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../WalkingHinge.html" target="new" target="alsj">animation</a> of the hinges on his  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../VirtualLRV.html" target="new" target="alsj">Virtual Rover</a>  in action.
119:17:20||alsj|All of the Commanders tried to land with a little forward velocity so that they wouldn't drift back onto unseen rocks or craters.
119:17:23||alsj|They will use reel-mounted tapes to slowly release the Rover.  John will pull the right-hand tape, which actually lowers the vehicle, while Charlie maintains tension on the left-hand tape.]

119:18:00||alsj|Unlike the other flights, there are no Apollo 16 pictures of the area under the LM.
119:18:04||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-5</a>, Charlie is climbing to the top of the ladder where he will pull a D-ring to release the top of the Rover package and let it rotate out a couple of degrees.  A set of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LRVDeployGrumman.html" target="main" target="alsj">Grumman LRV Deployment Cartoons</a> shows various stages of the Rover deployment.
119:18:04|Jones|alsj|What can you tell me about the jump up from the footpad to the ladder rungs.
119:18:04|Duke|alsj|It was a lot easier than I had expected.  You had been concerned about not being able to see your feet; but you just seemed to jump and everything landed right!
119:18:04|Jones|alsj|Was it mostly legs, or arms?
119:18:04|Duke|alsj|You'd jump mostly with your legs to push.  And you tried to jump and reach up and grab the side of the ladder. And the feet just seemed to fall in.  I was concerned about it at first; but, after I did it the first time, it was a piece of cake.
119:19:15||alsj|Charlie pulls the D-ring as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-5</a>.]</i></blockquote>
119:20:25||alsj|As indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the Apollo 16 Preliminary Science Report, they landed in an old, subdued, 150-meter-diameter crater.  The rim of this crater forms much of the local horizon.]</i></blockquote>
119:20:39||alsj|When the Rover package has rotated out about 45 degrees, the aft chassis section, which was folded over the middle chassis section, springs into place and the aft wheels also snap into place.  Don McMillan has provided a Virtual LRV <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../WalkingHinge.html" target="new" target="alsj">animation</a> of the deployment, with a focus on the walking hinges.  Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-72-HC-57.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">72-HC-57</a> shows a deployment at about this stage.  John is pulling on the righthand deployment tape while Charlie is off-camera to the right and has light tension on a cord attached to the rear edge of the aft section.  Note the cooling hoses and comm cables arcing down from the ceiling.
119:21:13|Young|tech|On Charlie's side, the left rear wheel was knocked down and locked, so Charlie gave that a pull and pulled that down.
119:21:13|Duke|tech|The wheels popped open just like they had done in training.  There's a gold sleeve collar arrangement that has a couple of pins in it so that, when the wheels are fully out, those pins lock in to hold the wheels in place.  That was what was not locked.  All you have to do is push on the wheel to extend that mechanism and it locks right in place.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:21:30|Jones|alsj|Was it a continuous <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">setting on the cooling</a>, rather than having little detents in it?
119:21:30|Duke|alsj|Well, there was some detents but I think you could just edge it out and it would hold.  I remember some distinct detents; you could click into medium and then max; but, also, you could just pull it out a little bit and it would hold - there was enough friction on the switch to hold it.
119:22:23||alsj|On Apollo 15, Dave Scott operated his tape by standing next to the LM and pulling the tape hand over hand.  Jim Irwin operated his by holding it taut and walking backwards away from the LM.  On Apollo 17, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt also used their legs, rather than their arms.
119:22:23|Duke|alsj|If I remember, we did it hand-over-hand, so we could stay close enough to watch this.  Apparently - it's starting to come back - as it started down, it bounced as we pulled.  As it bounced down, we kept having trouble with these walking hinges which, if I remember, was some things at the bottom that the chassis sort of rotated around in.  I've got a movie of the deployment of the training model in the MSOB (manned Spacecraft Operations Building) down at the Cape.&quot;]
119:22:23|Jones|alsj|Looking at the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Handbook</a>, Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-38.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1-38</a>, there are walking hinges down at the bottom.  And it just pivoted on that.  Let's see, that's the aft part of the chassis that's on the outside, that folds out and the forward part is on the inside, and the hinge between the fore and center chassis sections sits on the walking hinge.  And it's called the 'walking hinge' because the Rover actually moves out, away from the LM on that.&quot;]
119:22:23|Duke|alsj|Apparently, but I don't remember.
119:22:23||alsj|Don McMillan has provided a Virtual LRV <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../WalkingHinge.html" target="new" target="alsj">animation</a> of the walking hinges in action.
119:22:23|Jones|alsj|But the main thing is that you did that hand-over-hand. Do you remember anything about whether that was any particular difficulty doing that in a suit.
119:22:23|Duke|alsj|No, that was no problem.
119:22:38||alsj|In Houston, the Flight Director is told that the Rover is supposed to come out of the hinges at 73 degrees of rotation.]</i></blockquote>
119:22:53||alsj|This exchange suggests that John, at least, is now backing away from the LM.
119:22:54||alsj|This rock is at the lower left in AS16-107-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17441" target="new" target="alsj">17441</a>, which is a photo John takes at the start of EVA-2.  One of the LRV deployment tapes is hanging down above it.  The cosmic ray detector is in the footpad and, above and beyond that is the RTG fuel cask in the horizontal position.  The closed SEQ Bay doors are behind the cask.
119:23:40||alsj|Charlie has probably just given John the contingency tool with which they will pull some pins and make sure various latches are secure.  See Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-06a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-6a</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-06b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-06b</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lunar Roving Vehicle Operations Handbook</a>.]</i></blockquote>
119:24:16||alsj|The front of the Rover is attached to the LM by the saddle and telescoping rods shown in  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-37.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 1-37</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>. As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-5</a>, Charlie is removing some pins to decouple the Rover from the saddle.]</i></blockquote>
119:24:49|Jones|alsj|A couple of months ago, John told me that he had done some work in the airplane seeing if he could get down to one knee. Do you remember that?
119:24:49|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And he was good at it.  He would jump up and then sort of do a split and then he hit and the momentum would carry him down and he could grab a rock and then, once he got down, the suit tension would pop him back up.  He was very good at it.  I tried it a couple of times and I wasn't very good at it, so I stopped.  I'd looked at it...I could do it in the airplane but, up on the lunar surface, it just seemed like I was always off balance.  You know, I'd try to grab and I'd miss it, or I'd grab and it wouldn't come right and it would spin me one direction or the other and I'd end up falling down.  So I didn't do much of it; but he did.&quot;]
119:24:49|Jones|alsj|That brings to mind that there is one sequence in the TV (at about 121:48) where you try it when you're doing the drilling.&quot;]
119:24:49|Duke|alsj|I could do it...Just with the rocks I had the tough trouble.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:25:05|Jones|alsj|Were you a Fields fan when you were a kid?&quot;]
119:25:05|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
119:25:45||alsj|The checklist pages are bound with a wire coil - rather like a small spiral notebook - and the coil, in turn, is attached to a metal band which goes over the forearm just above the wrist.  The curvature of the band helps keep the pages from flipping.  A detail from Apollo 13 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../cuffcheckbind.jpg" title="image"  target="new" target="alsj">70-HC-83</a> is a good side view of Jim Lovell's cuff checklist.
119:25:45|Jones|alsj|Your checklist pages had the curved...Which supposedly kept them from turning.
119:25:45|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Supposedly; but it didn't.
119:25:45|Jones|alsj|Most of the time?
119:25:45|Duke|alsj|Most of the time they stayed.  I think, a lot of times, you'd touch it with a hand or brush it with something and that would help it flip over.&quot;]
119:25:45||alsj|Charlie wore the cuff checklist on his left arm, as can be seen in AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18651" target="new" target="alsj">18651</a>.  Photo AS12-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/20153730.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">7071</a> gives us a good view of Pete Conrad's cuff checklist.]</i></blockquote>
119:26:13|Young|tech|When we got it on the ground, Charlie and I just picked that baby up and moved it over so we didn't have to back it up (using the wheel motors in reverse).&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:26:32||alsj|During the ALSEP deployment, John will catch his foot in the heat flow experiment cable and will tear the cable at connector at the base of the Central Station.]
119:26:32|Jones|alsj|It's simply miraculous that there weren't more cable accidents.&quot;]
119:26:32|Duke|alsj|Yeah, I know.  It was easy to get tangled up in stuff, because you couldn't feel anything and you couldn't see anything on the bottom part of the suit.  You just couldn't look down too much and see your feet, so it was really miraculous we didn't get tangled up more than we did.  But, looking at one another and keeping track of one another really helped a lot.&quot;]
119:26:32|Jones|alsj|What, in your mind, is the best solution.  Stronger connectors?  Cable materials that stay flat?&quot;]
119:26:32|Duke|alsj|Those cables that we had, we told 'em in training that we were going to have problems with those, because they were like spaghetti.  The ones in training laid flat because they were used so much. You know, they didn't have their set in them.  But the actual ones, you started pulling them out and they kept the set.  And we had told them we thought we were going to have a problem, 'cause there were just a lot of cables coming around that Central Station.  I think strong connectors, tear-proof cables (are necessary).  (That is) certainly something you need to look at in the future, 'cause that's just tragic, you know, to tangle yourself up in a cable and pull it loose just because of some little accident.  So we need to design things that lay flat, if we can, and that would be stronger.  I think all of that would help.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:27:17||alsj|The post is behind the seats and, once John puts it upright, they can fit a mating sleeve on the geopallet over it.

119:28:04||alsj|&quot;Sock it to me&quot;, is the punchline of a running gag on the U.S. TV program 'Laugh-in' that was very popular at the time of the Apollo missions.  The gag is explained in some detail at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/a12.launch.html#1394100" target="new" target="alsj">139:41:00</a> in the Apollo 12 transcript.  Note that, here, John is using the phrase without any note of fatalism.  He is merely asking Charlie to pass over the contingency tool.

119:29:24|Duke|tech|One thing I'd like to comment on here is that I think they overdesigned the Velcro holding the seats down on the LRV.  A 2-inch or 1 1/2-inch wide piece of Velcro is wrapped around on themselves to hold the seat in place.  On my side, I started pulling the Velcro to try to get it off of the outboard handhold and the seat, and all I succeeded in doing is picking the vehicle up off the ground.  The Velcro wouldn't come loose.  Then I tried a couple of snatch loads and, by snatching it, I eventually got the Velcro off.  It was a hard job getting that Velcro off.  They really over-killed that one.&quot;]
119:29:24|Slayton|tech|I gather you thought all the Velcro as difficult to work, or (was) excessive.&quot;]
119:29:24|Duke|tech|Yes, I did.
119:29:24|Young|tech|For what we were using it for, it was.  Although, we had a couple of cases of these in-house devices (equipment made by NASA) that we will talk about later, where the Velcro was burned off, the glue that attaches the Velcro melted or something.  Like on the padded bags, and on the TV sunshade.  And there was something else (namely the Sample Collection Bag attachments).&quot;]

119:29:24|Duke|tech|It was just like you'd expect, Deke.  When you wanted the Velcro to work, it wouldn't work; and when you didn't want it to work, you couldn't get the son-of-a-gun off of there.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

119:30:42||alsj|They are probably positioning either the inboard armrests or the T-handles.
119:31:08||alsj|These are the &quot;tripod apex pins&quot; in Item 7 on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp043.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-7</a>.  Journal Contributor Keith Hearn  notes that the two tripods - one on each side - are attached to the Rover chasis and are part of the deployment hardware.  John and Charlie are now removing the tripods.  Don McMillan's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../WalkingHinge15.mov" target="new" target="alsj">animation</a> of the 'walking hinge' in operation has the tripod closest to the ladder labelled. Two of the three Quick Release pins on that tripod are shown.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV_Ops_Handbook_f2-6_sheet2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 2-6 (sheet 2)</a> in the LRV Operations Handbook (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV_OpsNAS8-25145.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">40 Mb</a>) and pages <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV_Ops_Handbook_p2-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-13</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV_Ops_Handbook_p2-14.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-14</a> detail the procedures.

119:31:08||alsj|McMillan adds, &quot;The tripods were attached to the rover chassis which were then connected to the Space Support Equipment on the LM. The tripod apexes were connected to support spools located on the left and right support arms, shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV_Ops_Handbook_f1-37.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 1-37</a> in the LRV Ops Handbook. Once the rover was deployed on the surface the pins were pulled and the tripods were disconnected. This next part is really clever. The center section of each tripod was then used as a toe hold on the appropriate side of the rover (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LRV_Ops_Handbook_f1-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Fig. 1-29</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LRV_Ops_Handbook_Sect_1.7.8.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Section 1.7.8</a>).&quot;</i></blockquote>

119:34:27||alsj|The Apollo 15 crew had a great deal of difficulty with their seatbelts because no allowance had been made, in adjusting the lengths, for the fact that, in one-six-g, the suits aren't as compressed as they are in 1 g.  To get a good fit, John and Charlie made some airplane flights, climbed on the Rover mock-up during periods of one-six-g, and made sure the belts were properly adjusted.

119:36:28|Jones|alsj|There is a some Apollo 17 TV which shows Jack doing some LM photography.  To get pictures of things at the top of the spacecraft, he got up on his toes, flexed his knees and pushed his chest out.
119:36:28|Duke|alsj|Yeah, you had to get in some strange positions.  I remember standing there, to take up this way, I had to lean (straining) back and push the bottom of the camera up and sort of...You could rotate the PLSS control box (RCU) it up a little bit and elevate your camera; plus, by bending backward, you could get some more elevation on it.  So that's what I'm talking about.&quot;]
119:36:28|Jones|alsj|Did you ever take the camera off the bracket to use it?&quot;]
119:36:28|Duke|alsj|Yeah, a lot of times...Well, I don't know about that.  No, mostly, when I used it, it was on the bracket.  I don't remember removing it to point it up.  It was easier to leave it on the bracket.&quot;]
119:36:28||alsj|Frame 18335 shows the Cosmic Ray Detector mounted on the side of the LM next to the Scientific Equipment (SEQ) Bay, which covered by dark gray door. On the other side of the SEQ Bay, the upright fuel cask holds the plutonium fuel element for the RTG.
119:37:02|Duke|alsj|We were always amazed when things worked!  (Laughing)  Because, in training, half the time it never worked.  So it was always 'Eureka!!! It's working!'  You know, millions of dollars they spent on this stuff and it was always a big surprise when it all worked for us.&quot;]
119:37:02||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp043.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-8</a>, John will make a counter-clockwise circle around the LM and park at the MESA.]</i></blockquote>
119:38:30||alsj|The Apollo 15 crew had no front steering during the first EVA.  At the start of EVA-2, however, it was working normally.  On the Apollo 16 Rover, the rear steering starts working when John leaves the LM for the ALSEP deployment site at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.alsepoff.html#1204521" target="new" target="alsj">120:45:21</a>.]
119:38:30||alsj|In the Apollo 16 Mission Report, after discussions of possible causes of the rear-steering anomaly, the following discussion focuses on a possible warm-up phenomenon. &quot;Another possible cause of the anomalous condition is in the steering servo system (Figure 14-70).  A signal generated by the handcontroller is coupled to the input servo amplifier as an error signal across a bridge.  This signal is amplified and applied to the steering-motor field coils in a direction determined by the polarity of the input signal which depends upon the direction of the handcontroller deflection.  The feedback potentiometer is driven by the steering motor in a direction to balance the bridge, thus canceling the original error signal.  A non-conductive lubricant, DC40, is applied to the wiper and resistive element of the potentiometers (in the handcontroller) to produce smooth operation and reduce noise.  At low temperatures, the lubricant could become more viscous and insulate the wiper from the resistive element.  No error signal would then be present at the input to the servo amplifier, although the handcontroller was deflected.  As the steering electronics heat up, the lubricant becomes less viscous.  Exercising the handcontroller then cleans the lubricant from the wiper and resistive element, allowing contact to be made.  This would account for the anomalous condition.  Tests will be conducted to determine the effect of the lubricant on the potentiometers at low temperatures.&quot;]
119:38:30||alsj|Readers should note that this explanation begs the question of why the rear steering was affected but not the front and why, in the Apollo 15 case, front steering became operable at the start of the second EVA.  On both flights, sun angle may have played a role in warming the lubricant. Changes may have been made to the steering system after Apollo 16 because no similar problems were experienced on Apollo 17.]</i></blockquote>
119:39:20|Young|tech|I wasn't particularly concerned about the rear steering not working, because we sort of planned not to use rear steering.  In fact, if the rear and front steering had gone out, we planned to go in a straight line as far as we could, get out, pick the thing up, and point it in the right direction and keep right on going.  On that particular site, that would have been hairy. We'd have been doing a lot of getting out and picking up.  But I still think, if we had to do it for any reasonable amount of time, it would have been a lot better than walking.&quot;]
119:39:20||alsj|As can be seen in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18339" target="new" target="alsj">18339</a>, John parked the Rover north of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> (north) strut with the vehicle pointed more or less toward the west.

Note that John has jumped perhaps a half meter off the ground.  The UV camera is in the LM shadow behind him and Stone Mountain is in the background.  The MESA is on the northwest face of the Descent Stage beyond the front of the Rover. What appears to be the gnomon is on the ground under the ladder and the LEC is draped on the ladder strut support.  The steerable antenna is the dark disk at the upper left of the Ascent Stage.]</i></blockquote>
119:40:28|Duke|alsj|(With regard to John's 'don't ask me to check') It was some mechanism back in there; you know, it was like a rack-and-pinion deal.  But I don't remember exactly what it was.&quot;]
119:40:28|Jones|alsj|But it would have meant getting down to look under the Rover.&quot;]
119:40:28|Duke|alsj|Well, yeah; and I forget exactly how you do it, but it was tough to get to.  We looked at in training to see if we could fix something, but it was just a pain.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:40:48||alsj|John will aim the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC71P628" target="new" target="alsj">UV camera</a> at a variety of astronomical sources and take pictures on ultraviolet-sensitive film.  Because the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs UV radiation, observations can only be made above the atmosphere.  Early observations had been made with sounding rocket flight and, after its launch on 7 December 1968, the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory satellite was used to make extensive observations. The Apollo 16 camera provided coverage at shorter wavelengths than could be detected with the OAO, and, of course, could observe the whole Earth.]
119:40:48||alsj|A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16lbl17436.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from AS16-107-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17436" target="new" target="alsj">17436</a>, a frame from a LM pan Charlie takes at the start of EVA-2, shows the empty Quad III Payload Pallet compartment where the UV camera is stowed. Quad III is on the northeast face of the spacecraft. The thermal blanket that covered the compartment hangs down from the bottom. As indicated on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp194.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 194</a> of the Final Lunar Surface Procedures document, the LRV Aft Pallet was stowed to the left of the Payload Pallet.
119:40:48||alsj|Note that John is at 0+50 in his checklist.

Compared with Apollo 15, the LRV deployment has gone quite smoothly.]</i></blockquote>
119:41:07||alsj|Most of the rocks at the landing site are breccias, a type of rock made up of fragments of other rocks merged together by the high stresses that occur in an impact.  Because many in the geologic community were expecting to find various types of volcanics at Descartes, this is a significant observation early in the EVA.
119:41:07|Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message|alsj|John Young - describing a rock near the LM as having dark clasts, that were biggies, and stating that it has 'got to be a breccia', as he was standing in front of it - should really have gotten our attention.  Again it was during a time that all of the conversation to this point had been concerned with powering down, getting into their suits, getting onto the lunar surface, and off-loading equipment, so it, too, could have gone on past our consciousness at that time. I hope that it didn't get by all of us that were involved!&quot;]

119:42:15||alsj|John probably mis-spoke when he said &quot;MESA blanket&quot;.  He is probably removing a thermal cover from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16lsp194.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Quad III</a> pallet that contains the UV camera.

See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-13</a> from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>.]
119:42:45|Jones|alsj|After you get the LCRU out of the MESA, you install it on the front of the LRV.  And that must have been fairly low.  Would that have been a problem getting down to get it into position?&quot;]
119:42:45|Duke|alsj|Yeah, I think so.  Uh-huh, to bend down at the knees.&quot;]
119:42:45|Jones|alsj|Did you have to use two hands on the LCRU?
119:42:45|Duke|alsj|I think so.
119:42:45||alsj|There is good video coverage of the LCRU installation on Apollo 15.]</i></blockquote>
119:42:45|Duke|alsj|If I remember, he had trouble reaching back into there.  And he was thinking he was going to have a tough time reaching in and getting that...There was a covering over the UV camera, and that's why he was so excited, because it came out with no problem at all.  There is a problem, I think.  You've got to be very careful that you try to cinch things down and Velcro things down in one g and then, you get up on the Moon and you might have to reach just a little bit farther and you try to pull things away and pull the Velcro off...And that Velcro was very, very strong.  You know, an inch-wide strip of Velcro that's maybe six (or) seven inches long - and it's fresh - is really difficult to pull.  That's why we said earlier we could pull - just trying to get the Velcro off the Rover seats, we could pick up the whole vehicle!
119:44:11||alsj|In person, John Young is a slight, quiet, reserved man who rarely makes eye contact.  The exuberance he shows here makes a stunning contrast.
119:44:11|Duke|alsj|John was ecstatic with the one-sixth gravity.  You know, in the training, even the lightweight stuff we had was difficult to horse around - these experiments and the UV camera and all that stuff - and, up there, like he said, he could just throw it over his shoulder.
119:44:11|Young|tech|Okay, the far-UV camera.  I didn't have any problem with off-loading it.  I expected trouble from the bags.  It came loose and I expected trouble picking the thing up and getting it off and I expected problems with keeping it out of the dust. I was able to get around the front of the vehicle (meaning the west side of the LM) and hold it over my head.  It was easy to carry that weight around.&quot;]
119:44:11||alsj|John was probably able to flex his suit more than any of the other astronauts.  Few would have been able to carry anything above shoulder height because of restricted arm movement.  Unfortunately, we have no TV of John performing this feat.]</i></blockquote>

119:45:01|Jones|alsj|Astromate connectors?
119:45:01|Duke|alsj|It was a push-and-turn type deal.
119:45:01|Jones|alsj|Was it a multiple pin-type connector?
119:45:01|Duke|alsj|Yeah, it was; but they had alignment marks.
119:45:01|Duke|tech|Everything went well on the LRV load-up until I tried to get the power connector on from the LRV to the LCRU.  The flight gear is really stiff and the cable had a set in it and it was just tough for me to get that Astromate connector on.  It took a lot longer than in training, but it finally locked in and that was really the only problem I had on the front end of the load-up.
119:45:01|Young|tech|The cables were what was stiff.
119:45:01|Duke|tech|You'd get the connector aligned and, to see where you were aligned, you had to put it in place and get over to the side; and, when I'd do that, the cable would spring out again.
119:46:14||alsj|Here, John is using &quot;wheels&quot; in the aircraft sense of landing gear.  There aren't any wheels on the bottom of the UV camera legs since small wheels would serve no purpose in the soft lunar surface.  See <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp199.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">figure 3.4-4</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.]</i></blockquote>
119:46:24|Young|tech|The place that we had to mount it in the shadow was in a small, subdued crater with about a 3- to 4-degree slope, and probably it was more than that.  The only way I could get the camera level was to really step down on two of the legs, push them clean down out of sight in the dirt, with the other leg sitting right on the surface.  And that was the first problem I had with it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

119:47:04|Duke|alsj|It wasn't going too well, I remember.  If I remember, you had to push it and lock it; and it was difficult to get enough strength (means leverage) to push it in and overcome the tension in the thing to lock it.  I remember we worked hard on that.&quot;] </i></blockquote>
119:47:45||alsj|John is looking at a patch called a tempa-label with a series of spots which change from white to black successively higher temperatures.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.
119:47:45|Duke|alsj|If I remember, they started about 100 degrees and went up every 50 degrees.  There was a little patch that would turn black  when the temperature got to that limit.  So it was like 100, 150, 200, 250.  And then I think it might have even had a 300 on it.  That was one thing I thought we always should have had, was a thermometer up there on the surface.  And Apollo never had a thermometer on the lunar surface; just had these little decals.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:47:47|Young|tech|The second problem (with the UV camera), which was a continual one, was the battery cable.  Even though I didn't deploy the battery too far out in the sunshine, the battery cable had a mind of its own and insisted on staying about 4 inches off the ground around the camera where I was walking, even though I pulled the whole thing back in there.  So, every time I walked around the camera, I had to pick my feet up to avoid the battery cable; and 2 or 3 times I tripped over it but, fortunately, it was the battery that moved and not the camera.&quot;]
119:47:47||alsj|John can be seen stepping over the battery cable in training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC71P628" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-628</a>.] </i></blockquote>
119:48:46||alsj|They had planned to start the first EVA at 102:25 and to reach this point in the timeline at about 103:25.  The 16-hour difference would create a pointing difference of about 8 degrees for all targets other than Earth.
119:49:47|Duke|alsj|Clyde and Troy were our suit technicians.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a11/ap11-KSC-69PC-376.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Troy Stewart</a> (shown with Neil Armstrong and Deke Slayton) was an Air Force Sergeant.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-teague.jpg" title=Image" target="new" target="alsj">Clyde Teague</a> (shown with Wally Schirra in September 1968) was retired military but was working at NASA.  I don't now about Clyde, but Troy's still around, I think.  And they were suit techs, working in Crew Systems Division.  They were with us the whole flight.  They got everything fitted and they took care of our suits - the flight suits and the training suits.&quot;]
119:49:47|Jones|alsj|One of the things I've discussed with Jack a bit is: at what point does a full-time suit tech becomes necessary at a lunar base?  One of the questions is: How many 8-hour EVAs do you think you could have gotten out of the EMUs before you really had a problem, even with the maximum maintenance you could do with more elbow room - say a suit prep room or something like that.&quot;]
119:49:47|Duke|alsj|To me, the suit probably wasn't going to be the limiting factor.  It was going to be the PLSS, probably, because it had all the mechanical components.  The suit was basically solid; and I felt that if you kept it clean - all the connectors and seals and stuff like that - after every EVA, like we tried to do - it was going to work.  It wasn't going to get sticky and the seals wouldn't be abraded and start leaking.&quot;]
119:49:47|Jones|alsj|Could you have gone ten EVAs?
119:49:47|Duke|alsj|It's hard to say.  Even though the suits look ratty on the outside - you know, they were covered with dust and they'd turned gray - the integrity of the suit was still solid.  You know, we pressurized that suit four times:  three on the Moon and one coming back (for Ken Mattingly's EVA).  I think, with a good maintenance schedule, you'd have been alright for ten EVAs, probably.  I'm not sure you need a full-time suit tech.  I think you could train on your suit to do some preventive maintenance and learn how to replace laces and stuff like that.  And we had done that a little bit.  On the way out, my suit didn't fit.  I felt like I had gotten it too short in the torso.&quot;]
119:49:47||alsj|&quot;You could let out the legs.  The legs had these laces and you could undo the laces and sort of work it around and it would extend the leg; and I was about ready to do that.  I felt like I could do that.  I had seen the suit techs do it; but they (meaning Houston) nixed it.  They didn't want me to do that, in case I screwed it up.  But with just a few more hours of preliminary training on cleaning seals and making sure the laces are right and preliminary inspections, I think a guy could maintain his own suit.&quot;
119:49:47||alsj|&quot;Now, I'm not so sure about a backpack, of course.  If you've got a mechanical problem, if a pump goes out or a cooling loop or you get a little leak here or there, then you're going to need somebody that's technically qualified to deal with it.&quot;]
119:49:47|Jones|alsj|It's going to be an issue when you start talking about people spending six months at a lunar base or, for some of the extended Mars missions where they're talking about six month to one-year stays.
119:49:47|Duke|alsj|I wouldn't waste a spot (that is, a crew position) with just a suit tech.  If you're going to have a guy who's technical, you need somebody who can be an expert on the environmental control systems and the suits and the Rover and whatever you're going to have up there.&quot;]
119:49:47|Jones|alsj|A general Mr. Fix-it.
119:49:47|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Somebody that was well-trained in everything.  That's going to be interesting - the crew make up.  A lot of thought should be given to that.&quot;]
119:49:47||alsj|I had a delightful conversation with Troy Stewart on Jan. 18, 1996.  He said that the cover layers on the training suits got shredded from working on the sand at the Cape.  On one occasion, he made a pink, heart-shape patch to cover a rip on the seat of Charlie's training suit.]
119:49:47||alsj|Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC72PC154" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-72PC-154</a> shows Charlie sporting blue, heart-shaped patches on his right thigh and right sleeve.
119:49:47||alsj|Troy mentioned that the Beta cloth was also subject to abrasion, particularly in places where it was ground between the PLSS and hard features inside the suit.  Later, the Beta cloth was replaced with a Teflon-coated Beta, which had better wear properties.  They did periodic maintenance on the training suits, roughly once every 25 use-hours unless something particular came up.  The rings and seals were cleaned and lubricated daily.  He did not look at the flight suits in detail after the missions but noted that they all looked like they had been sprayed with graphite powder.
119:49:47||alsj|Troy worked on Apollo 11, 13, 16, and 17.  He also said that, during the stand-down after the Challenger accident, he was a suit subject during some development work on an 8-psi hardsuit for the Space Station.  He said that the hardsuit is easier to manipulate at 8-psi than the 4-psi soft suit - except for the hands, which are about the same on the two suits.]</i></blockquote>
119:50:03||alsj|In a 1996 exchange of e-mail, Tony England suggested that the magnet in question is the magnet inside the camera used to focus the electrons produced by the UV radiation on a photocathode.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf13-2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">13-2</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  Evidently, something on John's suit was attracted by the magnet as it had been in training.  Possibilities include his watch and pressure gauge.  His wristrings are made of aluminum and would not be attracted.
119:50:28||alsj|Charlie has installed the LCRU and the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-GCTA.html" target="new" target="alsj">TCU</a> (Television Control Unit) on the front of the Rover and, next, will install the low-gain antenna on the top of John's inboard handhold.  The low-gain only has to be pointed to within about 30 degrees of Earth and, because the Earth is nearly overhead, John will not have to change the aiming as he drives. Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a> shows the installation of the TCU and Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-14.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-14</a> shows the low-gain antenna.

The canister contains both the low-gain and high-gain.]</i></blockquote>
119:50:42|Jones|alsj|Did you ever cross-train for these things (that is, did Charlie do any training on John's tasks)?&quot;]
119:50:42|Duke|alsj|A little.  I don't remember much about it; but, yeah, I could deploy the UV camera and I knew how to do the experiments at the Central Station - how to get 'em out and aligned and level.  We didn't practice much, I think; enough to be familiar with it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
119:51:20||alsj|We have good video of Dave Scott installing the high-gain antenna during Apollo 15.  The locking collar at the base of the antenna staff is shown in Detail A in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-12.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-12</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>.] </i></blockquote>
119:52:35||alsj|After locking the high-gain staff in place, Charlie opens the umbrella-shaped, wire-mesh dish.]</i></blockquote>
119:53:18||alsj|Although Charlie is supposed to align the high-gain antenna next, the following dialog suggests that he skips that step in order to install the TV camera.
119:53:49||alsj|During the 1992 mission review, Charlie was fairly confident that, here, he was installing the TV camera and connecting the cable.  The cable connection had given him trouble in training.]</i></blockquote>
119:54:05||alsj|John is leveling the UV camera as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp045.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-10</a>.  With it leveled and, initially pointing down-Sun, he will be able to point at various targets using an elevation gauge near the top and an azimuth gauge at the base.

119:55:26||alsj|Meanwhile, Charlie is aiming the high gain using the handle and sighting scope shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>.

119:55:45|Jones|alsj|Could you get your head back far enough to actually see it?
119:55:45|Duke|alsj|By leaning back, holding onto the antenna mast or the ladder or something, you could do it.  It was difficult, though.&quot;] </i></blockquote>
119:56:51||alsj|The level bubble is in a small, covered, bowl shaped cavity.]</i></blockquote>
119:58:30||alsj|Apparently, some function in the UV camera generates a VHF signal that can be picked up by the comm system.  The other possible source of VHF is the Command Module which, however, won't pass over the landing site for about another 16 minutes and, consequently, is well below the local horizon.
119:59:46||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp045.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-10</a>, John is carrying the Quad III LRV Aft Pallet to the Rover. This pallet was stowed just to the left of the Quad III Payload Pallet compartment where the UV camera is stowed, which is shown empty in a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16lbl17436.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from AS16-107-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17436" target="new" target="alsj">17436</a>, a frame from a LM pan Charlie will take at the start of EVA-2.  As indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16lsp194.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.4-1</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lunar Surface Procedures</a> volume, the LRV Aft pallet contains a variety of geology tools and, also, the penetrometer and the Portable magnetometer.  John is at the 1:05 mark in the checklist.  The EVA started at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new" target="alsj">118:53:33</a> and, consequently, John is on schedule.]</i></blockquote>
120:01:48|Young|tech|On the back end (Rover load-up), the old pallet just fell off (that is, came off easily) the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16lsp194.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Quad III</a> and fell onto the LRV and went right in place and locked right in place and I don't understand it (why the operation went so smoothly).  Just a piece of cake.  And the only problem I had was that, on one of the penetrometer pins (at the bottom on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp045.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-10</a>), the wire pulled loose so that, instead of having a loop, I just had a long piece of wire. I was able to wrap the wire around my hand and pull the pin.  The pin was pretty hard to pull and it was being pulled at an angle since the loop had broken.  But, nevertheless, it came off.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
120:02:54||alsj|The DAC is a 16-mm movie camera that Charlie will mount on his handhold as shown in  Figure  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-14.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2-14</a> from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>.

120:05:01||alsj|John has solved his penetrometer problem.
120:05:23||alsj|TV on.
120:05:40||alsj|Those listening to the audio track may have noticed a high-pitched beep at the start and end of each of Tony's transmissions.  Markus Mehring has provided a discussion of these <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../quindar.html" target="new" target="alsj">Quindar Tones</a>.

120:05:56||alsj|The Apollo 15 crew had numerous problems with their DAC because of film magazine jams and got very little usable film during their traverses.
120:06:23||alsj|John is loading equipment on the aft pallet.  In the meantime, Fendell finds Charlie at the MESA.  Charlie turns toward the Rover, carrying the ETB in his right hand and the DAC in his left.  The UV camera is at the right side of the TV frame.]</i></blockquote>
120:07:14||alsj|As per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev109.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-9</a>, Charlie has taken the ETB to the Rover.  He is standing next to John's seat and has probably just tried to toss the two padded bags listed near the bottom of the checklist page over onto the right-hand, LMP seat.  During training, it may have been easy to make the toss so that the bags would stay on the seat.  Here, because of the one-sixth gravity, they have probably bounced off and landed on the ground on the other side of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
120:07:33||alsj|Color television had come into widespread use only a few years before, in the mid-1960s.
120:07:35||alsj|Charlie is wearing John's camera.  He is holding the film magazine in his left hand and removes a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="new" target="alsj">dark slide</a> with his right hand.  The magazine is a cube about 3 to 4 inches - 7 to 10 cm - on a side.
120:07:54||alsj|Charlie inserts the magazine at the back of the camera and then reaches down with his left hand to get the handle-mounted trigger and advances the film by one or two frames.
120:07:56||alsj|Charlie takes the CDR camera off his RCU bracket and puts it on John's seat.
120:08:04|Young|tech|Unlike the training equipment, both the shovel and the rake were very easy to lock on (the extension handles) because it tells you which way to turn the thing to lock it and how to put it on.
120:08:04||alsj|Here, John is attaching the scoop to one of the two extension handles.]
120:08:04||alsj|Charlie looks at his cuff checklist.
120:08:08||alsj|Charlie picks up the DAC and reaches across to put it on the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>
120:08:09||alsj|Charlie's hands are off-camera, but he appears to move the ETB so that he can raise John's seat.
120:08:48||alsj|Although we can't see Charlie's hands or John's seat, it appears that, when Charlie tugs at the Velcro, he starts to fall forward and has to catch himself.]</i></blockquote>
120:08:48||alsj|Charlie continues to struggle with the Velcro.  The TV camera jiggles in response to his efforts.]</i></blockquote>
120:09:18||alsj|Charlie finally gets the Velcro loose.
120:09:36||alsj|A  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16seatstow.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">training photo</a> by Ed Dempsey shows the CDR camera in the stowage area under Charlie's seat.  Scan courtesy of Frederic Artner.]</i></blockquote>
120:09:49||alsj|John has mounted the vise on the top of the aft pallet behind Charlie's seat.  They will use the vise to separate the drill stem sections of the deep core.  Because of a design error, the Apollo 15 vise was mounted backwards and was all but useless to Scott and Irwin.  Needless to say, that error was corrected for Apollo 16.]</i></blockquote>
120:09:51||alsj|Charlie and I were unable to explain this transmission.  Obviously, something to do with the under-seat stowage is different than it was in training.  The under-seat stowage arrangement is shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf4-5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4-5</a> from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>.] </i></blockquote>
120:10:16||alsj|Charlie begins to transfer items from the ETB to John's seat pan.]</i></blockquote>

According to plan (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev109.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-9</a>), by this time Charlie was supposed to be at the LMP seat installing the map holder and the BSLSS (Buddy Secondary Life Support System).]</i></blockquote>
120:11:02||alsj|The Sun compass is a cardboard site map with a raisable gnomon that could be used as a navigation aid in the event on a Rover navigation failure.  The gnomon is used to orient the map relative to the Sun.  The only time this type of Sun compass was used during Apollo was when Dave used one during the Apollo 15 Stand-up EVA.  He used it to get rough bearings to prominent horizon features in an effort to pin down the LM location.  The inherent errors of a few hundred meters were too great to do much good in that regard.]
120:11:02||alsj|The &quot;500&quot; is a Hasselblad camera equipped with a 500-mm lens.]
120:11:02||alsj|Fendell pans clockwise to the UV camera.
120:11:17||alsj|John crosses our field-of-view carrying the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>.  It is the size of a large house-painting brush and John will attach it to a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-40.jpg" title="LCRU Battery" target="new" target="alsj">bracket on the LCRU</a>.

120:11:32||alsj|What John means is that, after he got the brush in the holder, he tugged on it to make sure it was secure and picked up the front of the Rover in the process.  The TV moved in response.
120:11:32||alsj|John crosses our field-of-view, looking at his checklist as he goes.  Fendell continues his clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
120:12:18||alsj|According to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp047.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-11</a>, the rake is one the MESA, possibly covered by the thermal blanket.  &quot;Doomaflicky&quot; is Charlie's equivalent of &quot;whachamacallit&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
120:12:32||alsj|Charlie may be attaching an individual-sample-bag holder to John's camera.  They will have troubles with the holders throughout the EVAs.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-60.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-60</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission Report.]
120:12:32||alsj|As Fendell continues his pan, there are noticeable effects of the changing sun angle.]
120:12:32|Duke|alsj|As you look down-Sun it was very, very bright.  And as you turned, either north or south, and looking cross-Sun, it (meaning the surface) got progressively darker and darker and you started seeing the shadows.  And then, when you looked up-Sun, it was very dark.  You were looking at the shadowed side of the rock and the soils and the dust grains, I guess, because the albedo (reflectivity) change just got really pronounced as you moved around.  You see that happening here.  He's panning to the north, here.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
120:13:01||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise stop.  Charlie still has some tasks to complete before he takes the ETB to the MESA.
120:13:11||alsj|Charlie comes into view.  He still has to mount the DAC on his handhold.  He gets the DAC off his seat.  At the back of the Rover, John stows the rake.]</i></blockquote>
120:14:14||alsj|The rake was the brainchild of Caltech geologist <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lee_silver.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lee Silver</a> and was first flown on Apollo 15.  It is rather like a clam rake and is used to collect rocks of more than a centimeter in size.  The rake is attached to an extension handle and, on Apollo 15, Scott and Irwin only had one extension handle.  Consequently, when they wanted to use the rake, they had to remove the scoop head that was usually on the handle and attach the  rake.  Fred Haise, the Apollo 13 LMP and the Apollo 16 backup Commander, may have come up with the idea of having two extension handles.]
120:14:14||alsj|Fendell reverses direction and we see Charlie get a holder for the traverse maps.]</i></blockquote>
120:14:31||alsj|Charlie attaches the map holder to his handhold and then picks up a couple of traverse maps.  Each map is a laminated sandwich of two piece of stiff cronopaque, photographic paper with a labeled picture of a part of the site on one side and a contour map of the same area on the other.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#lsp263" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 3.6.2-2</a>) is the contour map for EVAs 1 and 2 and Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.6.2-3</a> is the corresponding picture map.  Each of the maps is about 8 by 10 1/2 inches - 20 by 27 cm.]</i></blockquote>
120:14:34||alsj|Maps of Hadley Rille, such as the one shown mounted next to the console on the Apollo 15 Rover in a detail from AS15-85-11471 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15det11471.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">169k</a> ), are unmistakable.  Charlie is joking.  The maps he has show the Apollo 16 site.
120:14:34|Duke|alsj|We never had the right ones in training!  You know, the maps they gave us were not...They just threw anything out there.  So we never had the right ones.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
120:14:50||alsj|The EVA started 1 hour 22 minutes ago at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new" target="alsj">118:53:33</a>.  John is about to start the tasks on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp047.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-13</a> is about 7 minutes behind schedule.  Charlie is about to start <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev110.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-10</a> and is further behind.  Note that the SRC (Sample Return Container) tasks are also listed on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp047.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-11</a> so that either one of them could take care of them in the event that one of them was behind.  For the same reason, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp047.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-12</a> lists the tasks Charlie has just finished on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev109.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-9</a>.] </i></blockquote>
120:14:59||alsj|Charlie clips the maps to the holder which, evidently has aspring-operated retainer along the bottom edge.
120:15:13||alsj|According to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev110.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-10</a>, Charlie is supposed to get a pallet out of the MESA containing replacement batteries, food, etc. and take it up to the cabin.  After stowing the items taken off the pallet, he would then power down some of the LM comm circuitry that is no longer needed now that the LCRU is up and running.  However, in a moment Houston will tell him to defer the pallet transfer until the end of the EVA because the LM comm system is already operating at minimum power as part of the conservation measures dictated by the delayed landing.
120:15:13||alsj|During the following conversation, Charlie mounts the BSLSS behind his seat, attaching it with a Velcro strap.]</i></blockquote>
120:15:34||alsj|Charlie puts the end of his seat belt on the handhold so it will be out of the way, later, when he climbs on-board.]</i></blockquote>
120:15:55||alsj|Charlie goes around the front of the Rover to the MESA.  Fendell pans counter-clockwise.]</i></blockquote>
120:17:13||alsj|Fendell finds John at the right side of the MESA.]</i></blockquote>
120:17:23||alsj|They had planned to deploy the TV camera on a tripod before deploying the Rover but, because of the need to conserve LM power, skipped those procedures on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp041.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-5</a>.
120:17:41||alsj|The vacuum sealing mechanism on the rock box consists of a knife-edge on the rim of the body and a strip of soft-indium metal on the rim of the lid.  When the box is closed, the knife-edge sinks into the indium strip and makes the seal.  In addition to these features, there are also o-rings.  To keep the knife-edge from making contact with the indium strip during the flight out from Earth, the two are kept separate by a close-fitting spacer made of hard Teflon.  In addition, to keep the sealing edges clean while John and Charlie put samples in the box, they cover the rim of both the body and the lid with a piece of Beta cloth which has a cut-out to give access to the box cavity.  Evidently, John has knocked the Teflon spacer off the box he is preparing on the MESA.  My only doubt about this hypothesis is John's anticipation of later difficulties in closing the box.  Perhaps he is worried that its loss will increase the chances of damage to the sealing mechanism.  NASA photo S70-29817 is a pre-flight picture of an Apollo 14 rock box with the Teflon spacer surrounding the knife-edge.  NASA photo S88-52674 shows a rock box with a beta cloth cover protecting the knife-edge and indium strip.]
120:17:41||alsj|John takes a sample collection bag (SCB) to the Rover.  He will attach it to the Hand Tool Carrier (HTC) which is on the aft pallet.  NASA photos <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/images15.html#S7122475" target="new" target="alsj">S71-22475</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/images15.html#S7122477" target="new" target="alsj">S71-22477</a> show the tool carrier in a lab setting with two SCBs in place and AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17446" target="new" target="alsj">17446</a> shows the HTC on the back of the Apollo 16 Rover, albeit without an SCB.  The contents of the SCB, which was stowed in the rock box, are shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp205.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.5-5a</a> from the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.]</i></blockquote>
120:17:46||alsj|Charlie flexes his knees and jumps up onto the MESA.
120:17:46|Duke|alsj|I was leaning on the MESA and I just kicked up so I could get back in there and reach a piece of gear (the TV sunshield) that I was pulling out.  When I got up, I just sort of rested on my stomach, as I reached back over in there to get the thing.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
120:17:58||alsj|Before he gets down, Charlie bends his knees almost to 90 degrees.
120:17:58|Duke|alsj|That was to get back down.  That was to give you a little elevation.  I kicked 'em and then pushed...&quot;]
120:17:58|Jones|alsj|To get back off.  So you really could flex that knee a fair amount.  They came back about 90 degrees.&quot;]
120:17:58||alsj|I was thinking about the difficulty Charlie had with kneeling to pick things up off the ground.]
120:17:58|Duke|alsj|The reason you couldn't bend down and do like a deep knee bend was because of balance.  If you were leaning on something, you had a better chance of doing it.  But you get down and, to me, I was always off balance and either fall down or it'd hop you back up, or you'd run across...As you popped up, it'd throw you forward a little bit, so you'd have to run to catch up...for your feet to catch up with you.&quot;]
120:17:58||alsj|Indeed, a re-examination of the TV here shows that while Charlie did flex his knees virtually to 90 degrees, he didn't hold them in the bent position for any time at all.]
120:17:58|Jones|alsj|But, if you'd been next to the Rover, you think you could have just gotten down on your knees?&quot;]
120:17:58|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  In fact, John does it later on, around the ALSEP.&quot;]
120:17:58||alsj|Charlie's knee flex doesn't appear to help him get off the MESA and, a second later, he pushes himself off with his hands.]</i></blockquote>
120:18:13||alsj|During this exchange, Charlie unwrapped the sunshield but wound up with nothing in his hands.
120:18:13||alsj|Charlie grabs the MESA with his left hand and drops to his knees, illustrating the point discussed above.  He has to lean forward to get the sunshield and, as he rises, he hops forward, out of the TV field-of-view, to get his feet under his center of gravity.  Note the ETB swinging on the front of the MESA.]</i></blockquote>
120:18:33||alsj|Fendell starts to pan clockwise but doesn't find Charlie who has probably moved around the front of the Rover and is standing to the right of the TV so that he can install the sunshield.]</i></blockquote>
120:18:47||alsj|Charlie puts the sunshield on and then moves around to the front of the Rover so that he can look straight at the front of the TV camera to examine his handiwork.]</i></blockquote>
120:19:04||alsj|Charlie captured the sunshield in a number of his traverse photos, such as AS16-106-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17381" target="new" target="alsj">17381</a>  As is discussed at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta10prime.html#1692059" target="new" target="alsj">169:20:59</a>, the sunshield was attached to the front of the TV camera with Velcro.  A close-up photo from the right front of the publically-displayed <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../79-832_640LRV Qual.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Qualification Unit</a> at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum shows attachment Velcro on the top of the barrel and  surrounding the lens ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvtv2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1.6 Mb</a> or  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvtv2sm.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.4 Mb</a> ).  A photo from above gives a second view ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvtv1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.6 Mb</a> or  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvtv1sm.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.3 Mb</a> ).  In both photos, note the control tabs for 'IRIS' and 'ZOOM'.  In 17381 (linked above), the 'ZOOM' tab is clearly visible.
120:19:12||alsj|Charlie goes to the MESA and, after a delay dictated by the time it takes the TV picture to get to Houston and for Fendell's command to get to the camera, the TV pans counter clockwise to follow.]</i></blockquote>
120:19:18||alsj|John has mounted the SRC on a stand called the MESA &quot;table&quot;.  NASA photo S69-31080 shows Neil Armstrong working with an SRC on a MESA mock-up during training for Apollo 11.]</i></blockquote>
120:19:21||alsj|When Fendell finds them, Charlie is at the right side of the MESA and John is at the left.  John moves in and covers the left side of the MESA with the thermal blanket.]</i></blockquote>
120:19:34||alsj|The control sample is a roll of clean aluminum metal which Charlie has just put in an individual sample bag.
120:19:35||alsj|As can be seen in the three figures on page 55 of Judy Allton's &quot;Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools and Containers&quot;, the sample bags had a thin metal re-enforcing strip running along the top edges and, at either side, metal tabs.  The astronauts used two methods to seal the bags.  Most folded the top of the bag down a few times and then bent one of the tabs across one face of the folded bag and then the other tab across the opposite face, creating a &quot;Z&quot; pattern.  The other method, which Charlie employs here, is to grasp both tabs and spin the bag several times around the axis formed by the re-enforcing wire before finally &quot;Z-ing&quot; the tabs.  NASA photo S72-36984 is a post-flight picture of one of the Apollo 16 rock boxes and shows several spun bags.  The Z-pattern of closure is evident on the bag at the right side of the picture.]
120:19:35||alsj|Charlie puts the control sample in the SRC.
120:19:49||alsj|Charlie hops sideways to his left, going out of view as he heads for the SEQ Bay on the northeast face of the Descent Stage.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp194.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.4-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.
120:19:49||alsj|John has the U.S. Flag in his right hand.
||alsj|Charlie has headed around the north side of the LM to open the SEQ Bay doors on the northeast face of the Descent Stage as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev111.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-11</a>.  John is getting the flag out of the MESA as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp047.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-13</a>.  On TV, we are watching John at the MESA.  The only TV of an ALSEP off-load is from Apollo 14.]</i></blockquote>
120:19:57||alsj|Charlie is referring to the crater that John overflew during the final approach.  Had he landed closer to the crater, Charlie would have had a very difficult time reaching up to get the two ALSEP packages out of the SEQ Bay.  The ALSEP packages are affixed to booms on which they ride as Charlie pulls them out of the Bay.  Prior crews had then used a pulley system to lower the packages to the ground.  On Apollo 16, Charlie will simply lift the packages out of the Bay.
120:19:57||alsj|Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-71-H-1845.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">71-H-1845</a> (scan by Frederic Artner) shows the open SEQ Bay doors on the side of the LM mockup.  Charlie (left) appears to be assembling the carry bar which will fit in the socket visible on the face of the ALSEP package in front of him and in a corresponding socket on the package in front of John.
120:20:05||alsj|While John assembles the flag, under the Descent Stage at the left side of the TV picture, we can see Charlie's legs as he backs away from the LM, pulling a lanyard which will open the SEQ Bay doors.  A detailed discussion of the flag assembly can be found in Anne Platoff's '<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-usflag.html" target="new" target="alsj">Where No Flag Has Gone Before</a>'.
120:20:28||alsj|The SEQ Bay has a small, vertically hinged door on the left, which Charlie opened first.  It also has a two-secton, horizontally hinged door that is opened by pulling on a lanyard. Diagrams on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../SEQdoors.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 58</a> of Scott Sullivan's </i>Virtual LM<i> illustrate the way the main door is hinged.  Additonal details can be found on pages 38 to 47.
120:20:28||alsj|Charlie moves in toward the SEQ Bay and drops the lanyard.
120:20:28||alsj|Journal Contributor Karsten Rinkema notes that the TV images brightens for a few seconds, then returns to the previous level.  Because there are no signficants changes in relative brightness across the scene, Journal Contributor Bill Wood suggests that some one on Ed <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a>'s team in Houston sent a command to change the Automatic Light Control setting from 'Peak' to 'Average' to see if the picture quality improved.  Evidently, a decision was made to return to 'Peak'.  See section 4.4.4 in the Ground Control Television Assembly Manual ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../GCTA-Manual.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">7Mb PDF</a> ).</i></blockquote>
120:20:59|Duke|tech|It looked exactly like it was the same level as in the training building.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
120:21:01||alsj|This is Item 2 under &quot;MESA Work&quot; on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp047.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-13</a>, a step that John forgot to do.  Tony has misspoken.  The LiOH can is supposed to go in the center of the MESA, but not in the Sun.]</i></blockquote>
120:21:07||alsj|Somebody in Houston points out Tony's error.]</i></blockquote>
120:21:35||alsj|Normally, John would have helped Charlie with the ALSEP off-load as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp049.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-14</a>.  However, because of the various changes in procedures, Charlie is doing all of the work himself.  On  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev111.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-11</a>, note that Charlie does not have copies of John's procedures in his checklist.  After Charlie removed the experiment package, John would have removed the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rtg_empl.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">RTG</a> (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) package.  The RTG provides electric power to the ALSEP experiments and must be fueled with a plutonium source which, at the moment, is sealed in a graphite cask mounted on the side of the spacecraft to the left of the SEQ Bay.]
120:21:35||alsj|At the MESA, John has assembled the two-part flag staff and has removed a cover from the flag.  The flag a telescoping crossbar thread into a hem sewn along the top of the flag.  The crossbar is attached to the top of the upper staff section by a locking hinge and John has to raise the crossbar, lock it into place, and extend it.
120:21:52||alsj|Apparently, the bottom of the flag detached from the staff, but John quickly re-attaches it.  He plants the flagstaff in the ground and takes a few minutes to shape the stiffened flag properly.  In the process, the upper section of the flagstaff comes out of the lower section that is sticking in the ground.
120:23:04||alsj|While Charlie was talking, John tries to retrieve the lower staff section by bobbing down to his knees but can't grab it.  He then kneels without apparent difficulty, using the bottom of the upper staff section for support.  He then rises with ease and does a little hop to get his feet under him, all without tipping forward as happens to many of the other astronauts in similar situations.  Finally, he re-attaches the staff sections and moves off-camera to the left.  After the usual delay, Fendell starts to follow but quickly realizes that he probably won't find John before reaching the counter-clockwise stop.
120:23:04|Young|tech|I can honestly say I had as much trouble putting the flag together in one-sixth gravity as I did in one gravity.  My main concern was with the TV sitting there watching us: that we'd end up with the flag in the dirt and us standing on it.  As soon as I picked up the lower leg of the flag, I dropped it and I was in the dirt.  So, I was bent over holding the flag up with one hand and I picked the thing up and put it together.&quot;]
120:23:04||alsj|Fendell reverse direction and starts a clockwise pan.
120:23:43||alsj|John plants the flag next to a rock about 1/3 of a meter across.  The rock is between Charlie and the flag in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18341" target="new" target="alsj">18341</a>.] </i></blockquote>
120:24:16||alsj|Fendell finds the flag north of the Rover and just catches John's shadow as he heads for the MESA.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> for the flag location.
120:24:23||alsj|The dirt on John's legs can be seen in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18339" target="new" target="alsj">18339</a>, which Charlie will take in just a few minutes.  In that picture, John's legs are partially shadowed.  Frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18388" target="new" target="alsj">18388</a>, which Charlie takes at the end of the ALSEP deployment, is a better picture of John's dirty legs.  In <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18341" target="new" target="alsj">18341</a>, we see that Charlie's legs are getting dirty, too.]</i></blockquote>
120:24:59||alsj|Charlie comes into view and goes beyond the flag to get into position to takes some tourist pictures of John.
120:25:08|Jones|alsj|You were going out to the flag bouncing a little bit, although not as easily as you do later.
120:25:08|Duke|alsj|I felt right at home, almost from the moment we hit the ground.  You just felt like your balance was good.  I didn't feel like I could do any high jumps at this point, 'cause we did get better at it.  I found there were really three ways...You could run, you know, one leg in front of the other (in a) normal run; or you could skip; or you could...
120:25:08|Jones|alsj|Kangaroo hop?
120:25:08|Duke|alsj|Well, that kangaroo hop...but it was sort of a side to side motion that I had.  (Demonstrating) Like that, you see.
120:25:08|Jones|alsj|You turn so that your maybe 45 degrees, say with your left foot forward.  Bring that forward follow with the right, bring that up to it and then go again.
120:25:08|Duke|alsj|On sort of a side step thing.  And I found that was real comfortable and it gave me real good balance if I was just moving around, short distances, like I did going out to the flag there.
120:25:08||alsj|We watched the video sequence again.
120:25:08|Jones|alsj|Yeah, that's sort of what you're doing.  You've got your left foot forward, and you're only turned about 30 degrees off of straight ahead.
120:25:08|Duke|alsj|See, I was walking and then I just...(pause)
120:25:08|Jones|alsj|Yeah.  You've got good bounce already.
120:25:08||alsj|Charlie stops and then, apparently, examines a rock.  His wide-leg stance suggests, however, that he is urinating.
120:25:16||alsj|Charlie turns to face the LM and then side-hops to his left about 4 or 5 meters to get lined up for the pictures.
120:25:23||alsj|John walks into view and waves his right arm in and out at shoulder level to position the restraining cable so that he can salute.
120:25:40||alsj|And 'echo' of part of Tony's transmission, particularly the word 'picture' can be heard in Charlie's following transmission, presumably involving a round trip from the Earth to the Moon via Charlie's headset and microphones.  Prof. David Keeports at Mills College, Oakland, California, measured a time delay of 2.716 seconds, which necessarily represents a trip from the Earth to the Moon and back, plus signal propagation between Houston and the <a href="../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid Tracking Station</a>, which has the Moon in sight at this time, 18:20 UTC on 21 April 1972.  I've used Celestia to create a view of the Earth ( <a href="a16GET1202540Earth.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">80k</a> ) from Descartes at this time.  The Sahara dominates the center of the disk.  Using <a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons" target="new" target="alsj">JPL Horizons</a> the range of the landing site from the Madrid Tracking Station is 1.284 light seconds.  The one-way time delay measured from the echo is 1.358 seconds, leaving 0.074 seconds  for the signal to get from Madrid to Houston and/or for uncertainties in tape speed, etc. 
120:25:40||alsj|John Saxon, who was Operations Manager at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station during Apollo 16, writes &quot;Honeysuckle usually communicated via microwave to a mid NSW ground station at Ceduna (South Australia), then via a pacific (geostationary) satellite to the San Francisco area, then various microwaves to/from Houston - via Goddard switching centre in Maryland. But occasionally we would use Mwave Houston to Goddard, then Atlantic satellite, then Indian Ocean satellite to Carnarvon on the (Australian) west coast to Honeysuckle. The round trip time to a geosynchronous satellite is about 0.239 seconds - noticeable -  and therefore two hops is nearly 1/2 sec - annoying - before it even gets uplinked to the lunar surface and returns  - possibly via another couple of terrestrial 'hops'. It can all add up. And let's not even think about Manned Spaceflight Network relay configurations where one ground station sends the voice uplink and uses the downlink from another station which maybe relays via a 3rd or 4th station to the second spacecraft (usually CSM) which then replies to Houston etc! No wonder the ground network occasionally - but not very often - ended up in almost infinite echo feedback loops - sometimes via the moon! That was never popular with anyone - specially the astronauts.&quot;
120:25:40||alsj|The difference between Keeports's 2.716 second timing of the echo of Tony's 'picture' and the two-way Earth-Moon transit time is 0.161 seconds, which suggests that the path from Houston to  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid</a> did not involve any geostationary satellites.  However, Ken Glover notes that the digital audio clips in the ALSJ were made from cassette tapes supplied to us by NASA Johnson and that those are subject to differences in recording and playback speeds, the effects of tape stretch, etc.
120:25:40||alsj|John bends his knees slightly, springs about a half meter off the ground, and salutes.  He is off the ground about 1.45 seconds which, in the lunar gravity field, means that he launched himself at a velocity of about 1.17 m/s and reached a maximum height of 0.42 m.  This superb picture is AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18339" target="new" target="alsj">18339</a>.  Note that John's total weight - body, suit, and backpack, is about 30 kilograms or 65 pounds.  In Houston, Tony chuckles with delight.]

120:25:40|Jones|alsj|John's jumps says to me he's got a great deal of confidence this early.
120:25:40|Duke|alsj|His balance was really extraordinary.
120:25:40||alsj|John's second jump lasts about 1.30 seconds and, consequently, his launch velocity is about 1.05 m/s and his maximum height is 0.34 m.  This picture is AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18340" target="new" target="alsj">18340 </a>.]
120:25:40||alsj|Journal Contributor Joe Cannaday notes that the peak of John's first jump was at about 120:25:49 and the peak of the second was three seconds later at 120:25:52.
120:25:54||alsj|While John walks toward him, Charlie takes the Hasselblad off his RCU bracket and gives it to John.
120:25:54||alsj|Charlie reaches the flag and bounces around to face John.
120:26:15||alsj|Charlie salutes.  The picture is AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18341" target="new" target="alsj">18341</a>.] </i></blockquote>

120:26:16||alsj|Journal Contributor James Fincannon has used sunrise-to-sunset sequences of LROC images on the site to demonstrate that, as of 2009-2011, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16FlagStillAloft.html" target="new" target="alsj">the Apollo 16 flag is still aloft and casting a shadow</a>.</i></blockquote>
120:26:30||alsj|John and Charlie return to the Rover.  Once again, Charlie does a leisurely skip, getting slightly off the ground each time.  John takes the Hasselblad off the RCU bracket and walks back.
120:26:44||alsj|John became the Chief of the Astronaut Office in 1975 and, later, appointed himself to command the first Shuttle flight.  STS-1 was 36-orbit mission launched on April 12, 1981, the twentieth anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's Vostok flight.  The pilot - and only other crewmember - on STS-1 was Robert Crippen.

120:27:38||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise stop and reverses direction.]</i></blockquote>

He will attach the two ALSEP packages to the ends so that Charlie can carry the assembly like a barbell as he goes out to the deployment site.]</i></blockquote>
120:28:40||alsj|Charlie will fuel the RTG with a plutonium fuel element which is currently in a cask at the left side of the SEQ Bay.  John's &quot;hot stuff&quot; is a reference not to the radioactivity but the fact that the surface temperature of the graphite cask is about 500 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit (260 to 370 Celsius) and the fuel element temperature is about 1400 F.  For details and photos of the first RTG fueling operation, see the Apollo 12 Lunar Surface Journal at  116:38:50 in the ALSEP Off-Loading chapter.</a>.
120:29:10||alsj|Charlie is using a lanyard to rotate the fuel cask from vertical to horizontal.
120:29:29||alsj|Charlie now has the dome removal tool - or DRT as on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev111.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-11</a> - with which he will remove the hemispherical <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rtg.cask.detail.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">dome</a> covering the fuel element.]</i></blockquote>
120:29:34||alsj|The other tool is the Fuel Transfer Tool which Charlie will use to transfer the fuel element from the cask to the RTG. </i></blockquote>
120:30:06|Duke|tech|We got the pole (meaning the carry bar) together and dropped that (fuel cask) down (to horizontal).  I didn't quite get it (meaning the dome removal tool) locked on before I started changing it.  I thought I'd lost the dome, but I started over again and made sure the tool was locked in; and then the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rtg.cask.detail.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">dome</a> came right off with no trouble.
120:30:06||alsj|The &quot;scary part&quot; was, of course, that they wouldn't be able to remove the dome and, consequently, that they would lose all of the ALSEP experiments for lack of power.
120:30:06||alsj|Fendell stops his counter-clockwise pan and, because John and Charlie are out of sight on the far side of the LM, Fendell slowly pans upward to examine the spacecraft.
120:30:30||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the disk-shaped steerable (high-gain) antenna.
120:30:45||alsj|John may be moving the dome with the still-attached removal tool out of the way.
120:31:10||alsj|Charlie is removing the fuel element from the cask and is transferring it to the RTG.
120:31:10|Duke|tech|Off-loading of the fuel was just like we'd done it in the trainer.  It wasn't red like it's painted in the training model; it was black.  I couldn't feel any heat coming off of it.
120:31:13||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the US flag on the side of the Descent Stage.  At the right side of the TV picture, we see John going to the UV camera.
120:31:37||alsj|Fendell pans right and we watch John trying to get over a cable.  He gets his foot caught and has to lift his foot and shake it to get the cable off.  Fendell continues to pan.]</i></blockquote>
120:32:08||alsj|Fendell stops his pan and returns to John just as he turns the UV camera to a new target.
120:32:28||alsj|After turning the UV camera to the new azimuth, John turns a wheel near the top of the camera to change the elevation.]</i></blockquote>
120:32:54||alsj|Heart-rate records for the first EVA are shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Mission Report</a> figures  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-3a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3a</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-3b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3b</a> for John and Charlie, respectively.  John's rate is in the mid-90s and Charlie's is in between 110 and 115.  At about 120:33:40, Charlie starts carrying the ALSEP packages out to the deployment site and his heart rate will peak at over 140 beats per minute.]</i></blockquote>
120:33:00||alsj|The UV camera is now pointed nearly straight up at Earth.  John moves around to the south side of the camera to look through a sighting device to check his alignment.
120:33:25||alsj|The UV camera's field-of view is about 20 degrees while the Earth is about 2 degrees across.
120:33:25||alsj|In Houston, the Flight Director asks the Flight Surgeon about Charlie's heart rate, which is &quot;over 100&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
120:33:46||alsj|When John presses the reset switch, the camera takes two images and two spectra, each with its own filter and pass band.  The exposure times can be selected to be as short as 0.5 minutes or as long as 200 minutes and the total time spent on any one target can range from 20 minutes to 16 hours.  John is about to start a set of exposures of the Earth and the procedures here are different from those associated with other targets.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp448.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">5.3-1</a> from the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, which shows the decal that is attached to the camera.]
120:33:46||alsj|Charlie comes into view, carrying the ALSEP packages and taking them west of the LM.  According to the deployment diagram on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev112.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-12</a>, he is planning to carry the packages about 330 feet west of the LM.  He is at 1:37 in the checklist.  The EVA started at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new" target="alsj">118:53:33</a> and, consequently, Charlie is only three minutes behind schedule - in part due to the fact that they skipped the LMP ingress.]
120:33:46||alsj|Brian McInall has created a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ALSEP-DeploymentPlanimetricMapLROC-M175179080LR_Jan2017.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">planimetric map</a> of the ALSEP deployment that includes both Charlie's walking path out to the deployment site and John's Rover tracks.
120:33:53||alsj|Charlie is trying to skip but is too weighed down to get any elevation.  After crossing the TV field-of-view, he stops to examine a rock which is just out of our picture to the right.]</i></blockquote>
120:33:57|Muehlberger, from a 1997 e-mail message|alsj|How to tantalize. No further comment about it!
120:34:03||alsj|This is reference to the 2.25 minute wait which is the fourth line under Item 2 on the back of the decal.]</i></blockquote>
120:34:05||alsj|Charlie starts off again and Fendell shifts his aim slightly to the right to bring the rock into view.  For a moment, he doesn't follow Charlie and keeps John at the left side of the frame.]</i></blockquote>
120:34:12||alsj|Fendell pans right to follow Charlie, who is now walking with, perhaps, a slight bounce on each step.]</i></blockquote>
120:34:28||alsj|About the time John reached 10 in his count, the right-hand (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rtg_empl.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">RTG</a>) package comes off the carrybar and falls slowly to the ground.  The weight of the other packages forces Charlie to veer left to keep both his balance and his grip on the carrybar.  The bottom of the RTG package was no more than a meter off the ground so the fall took about 1.1 seconds and the impact velocity was about 1.8 m/s.  The surface is, of course, very soft.  After it hits, the package rolls into a shallow, foreground crater.
120:34:29||alsj|In watching the video, Charlie and I agreed that he had the carrybar cradled in the crook of his elbows, a technique used by most of the LMPs.]
120:34:29|Duke|alsj|Boy, my heart just dropped when that thing fell off, 'cause that had all the experiments in it.  I don't understand why it just didn't lock in right, I guess, when put it together.  It had one of these brackets that was open at the bottom; and this carry bar just went in there and you had to pick it up into this bracket and lock it.  And it looked like it was locked to me when I picked it up and I shook it.  As you see, when I was going out there, it was bouncing up and down and it just bounced off.&quot;]
120:34:29||alsj|On Apollo 12, Al Bean noticed his RTG package tended to rotate and recommended installation of a locking mechanism.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/a12.alsepoff.html#1165243" target="new" target="alsj">116:52:43</a> in the A12LSJ.
120:34:29||alsj|Apollo 13 photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a13/ap13-KSC-70PC-15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-70PC-15</a> shows Jim Lovell carrying the ALSEP packages during training.  He is carrying it in the arms-down position.  The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rtg_empl.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">RTG</a> pallet is on Lovell's left.  Note the locking mechanism with which the pallets are secured to the carrybar and, also, the Universal Handling Tool (UHT) attached to each of the pallets.
120:34:29|Jones|alsj|It was the Central Station mast that was the carry bar...&quot;]
120:34:29|Duke|alsj|That's right.
120:34:29|Jones|alsj|...and was really very flexible and what...
120:34:29|Duke|alsj|Well, actually, that thing wasn't so flexible as I was going out and bouncing, it was bouncing on my arm. The whole deal.&quot;]
120:34:29|Jones|alsj|But, when the package on the right side came off, somehow you managed to hang on to the package on the left side...&quot;]
120:34:29|Duke|alsj|I just grab it with...I wrapped my right arm around it.&quot;]
120:34:29||alsj|We looked at the sequence again and decided that, as he veered left, he got his right hand on the end of the carry bar so that it wouldn't tip off his left elbow.]</i></blockquote>
120:34:34||alsj|Charlie sets the left-hand package on the ground and walks over to examine the other one.
120:34:46||alsj|Evidently, John is talking about filter and/or film changes rather than a physical motion of the camera as a whole, but that distinction is not clear.]
120:34:46||alsj|During John's next transmission, Charlie rights the fallen package, picks it up, and hits it a few times with his left hand to knock the dirt off it.
120:34:47||alsj|Charlie leans to his right and re-attaches the fallen package to the carrybar.]</i></blockquote>
120:35:54||alsj|Charlie jerks the packages several times, pulling it toward himself and rotating it around the carrybar to get it to seat in the lock.]</i></blockquote>
120:36:04||alsj|In Houston, Experiments and the Flight Director decide to have John repeat the entire procedure.]
120:36:04||alsj|Charlie continues to struggle with the lock and then picks up the carrybar and shakes the entire assembly to make sure the right-hand package is firmly locked.]</i></blockquote>
120:36:30||alsj|Charlie finishes with the lock and then stands still for a few minutes to rest.]</i></blockquote>
120:36:55|Duke|alsj|Even up there it was heavy.  I thought I'd damaged the experiment or broke it or something.  That it was all lost, and that's why I was feeling so bad.  Turned out, it didn't bend any of the fins, didn't dent any of the experiments.  It hits and just bounced and was okay.
120:37:20||alsj|Charlie lifts the package to get it up on his arms again.]
120:37:20|Duke|alsj|It's like a weight-lifter that's going to do a snatch-and-jerk or whatever they call it.  You reach down with your palms out and you grab hold of the bar; and the object is to bend and pull it up and throw it up and then catch it in your elbows.  And, what happened as I started up with it, it was so heavy it just pulled me forward.  It pulled me off balance; and I was trying to run forward to catch up with it - stay under it - and that's why I ran out of the picture here.  But I eventually got it up.&quot;]
120:37:20|Jones|alsj|So, even with heavy things, the one-sixth g does help because it stays up for a while.
120:37:20||alsj|We watched the sequence again.
120:37:20|Jones|alsj|Hands on it, up, run forward about seven or eight steps...&quot;]
120:37:20|Duke|alsj|And then I got it back up in my elbows.
120:37:20|Jones|alsj|And you're on your away.
120:37:20|Duke|tech|(At the LM) it apparently looked like it was locked on the RTG side and I could not pull it up any more, and it looked locked to me, though there was about a quarter of a sixteenth of an inch between the little half dome and the mast,  but it still looked locked; but, as I was bouncing out there, I had gotten to about 25 meters and the RTG package fell off.  It bounced into a crater.  I thought I had blown it then, because of those very fragile fins on the RTG.
120:38:08||alsj|Charlie is walking flat-footed because of the load.]</i></blockquote>
120:38:15||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf15-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">15-1</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the Cosmic Ray Experiment is currently mounted on the Descent Stage to the right of the SEQ Bay.  John will now move it to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> (south) footpad.
120:38:15||alsj|Charlie is near the top of the ridge west of the LM and puts the ALSEP packages down.]
120:38:15|Duke|tech|Some of the hardest work I did was carrying that beauty out to where we finally deployed it.
120:38:15||alsj|As can be heard in the audio track of the TV clip, during this break, the Surgeon tells the Flight director that Charlie's heart rate peaks at 160 beats per minute
120:39:11||alsj|The following is taken from the Apollo 16 Mission Report.]
120:39:11||alsj|&quot;The Commander pulled the red-ring lanyard to shift the shade in Panel 4.  The shade moved only 1 inch instead of about 3.5 inches and the lanyard broke.&quot;]
120:39:11||alsj|&quot;A movable platinum shade  (Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-55.jpg" title="image" target="ne" target="alsj">14-55</a>) covers the top half of panel 4 during Translunar flight and until after the radioisotope thermoelectric generator is removed from the area during lunar surface operations.  The shade passes over a rough guide bar at the top of the instrument (see Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-56.jpg" title="image" target="ne" target="alsj">14-56</a>) and is connected in the back of the panel to the movable target plate.  The red-ring lanyard is attached to the bottom edge of the target plate and, passing behind panels 1, 2, and 3, it extends from the bottom of panel 1.  When the lanyard is pulled down, the target plate moves down and the platinum foil moves upward over the round guide bar.  This exposes material mounted on the stationary backplate.&quot;]
120:39:11||alsj|&quot;Examination of the panel assembly has shown that the failure of the shifting mechanism was caused by a clamping of the target plate by two retention bar screws which projected past the backplate into the target plate, and effectively locked it in place (Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-57.jpg" title="image" target="ne" target="alsj">14-57</a>).&quot;
120:39:11||alsj|&quot;Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-56.jpg" title="image" target="ne" target="alsj">14-56</a> shows the panel-4 assembly with the target plate and shade fully deployed after having backed off the two projecting screws. Note the rub mark from the screws on the target plate.&quot;]
120:39:11||alsj|&quot;The assembly performed satisfactorily when deployed during the pre-flight fit and function check.  However, it was necessary to refurbish the hardware after this operation, and the screw clearances may have changed as a result of the refurbishment.  This experiment is not scheduled for another mission.&quot;]
120:39:11||alsj|During the exchange between John and Tony, Charlie turns to look west and then turns to look off to the south.  Finally, he turns to look east and raises his left hand to shield his eyes.  He may be facing southeast so that he isn't looking directly into the Sun.]</i></blockquote>
120:39:16||alsj|In AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18367" target="new" target="alsj">18367</a>, Stone Mountain is the hill on the right and Kenesaw is probably the hill beyond it to the south.   Frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18368" target="new" target="alsj">18368</a> shows the two large craters that Charlie describes at the western foot of Kenesaw.  Ravine Crater is east of North Ray Crater and is shown in Figure 6-4 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-4.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">648k</a> ) from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.

120:39:16|Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message|alsj|Dome is north of Sugar Loaf, which is shown on Plate 2, USGS Professional Paper 1048, 'Geology of the Apollo 16 Area, Central Lunar Highlands'.  Sugar Loaf is a high domical feature about 2 km north of North Ray Crater.  Dome is slightly west of north about 5 km from North Ray and even higher.  It appears on 'Geologic map of the Apollo 16 (Descartes) region' by D.P. Elston, E.L. Boudette, and J.P. Schafer, April 1972, scale approximately 1:100,000.  I have a blue-line copy. I have no idea whether it was ever published, there is no identification number on my copy.
120:39:16|Duke|alsj|We named Kenesaw after a mountain in Georgia, which is north of Atlanta
120:39:16|Jones|alsj|Any special significance?
120:39:16|Duke|alsj|No.  Dotty (Charlie's wife) being from Atlanta and all. We had one Stone Mountain (because) John's from Georgia and lived up there near Kenesaw when he was a kid, so we just picked that.&quot;] </i></blockquote>
120:40:10||alsj|TV off, just as Charlie reaches down to grab the carrybar with his right hand.

With the arm deployed and the Rover pointed more or less down-Sun, the Sun Shadow device  and the known position of the Sun in the local sky allows a precise determination of the Rover heading. Don McMillan has provided an animation (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../sundevice_v3.mov" title="animation" target="new" target="alsj">2 Mb</a>) of the Sun Shadow device being put in position to provide a reading.

John reads pitch first and then rotates the instrument around an up-down axis to bring the roll indicator into view.]</i></blockquote>
120:41:23|Experts in Houston will now use the Sun shadow, pitch, and roll readings to do a quick calculation of the true Rover heading and John will change|alsj|torque - the heading indicator until it shows the proper reading.
120:41:37||alsj|John is referring to the LRV Operations Decal, which is Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp302.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.7-9</a> from the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  As indicated in the &quot;Nav Align&quot; section he wanted to be parked with the Sun Shadow Device reading no more than 3 degrees off center and with no more than 6 degrees of roll and pitch.  He then closed the Nav circuit breaker and needed to wait at least 1.5 minutes before cycling the System Reset switch to Reset and then Off. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf2-11.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 2-11</a> from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a> shows the Nav circuit breaker at the upper right and the System Reset switch just below in.]</i></blockquote>

120:42:53|Duke|alsj|I'm not sure it was a very good spot, but it was the best we had.  It's really </i>difficult<i> to find a real flat spot where some experiment's not in a little crater or off angle or something. You know, for long-duration (future) missions, if you have too many narrow constraints on the experiments, it'll be real difficult to find a spot up there on the Moon where you can lay everything out within a confined area of one central power source like we had in Apollo.  A lot of thought ought to go into that; and not have the experiments that have to be so precisely aligned and positioned.  I know, sometimes, you've got to do that; but, if there's any way you can get around it, boy, it would be nice.  We didn't feel like we were so particularly constrained; but, you know, in training we laid it out in a place that was like a big billiard table; and everything went out and you could put it exactly right and get the lines straight.  Up on the Moon, it was not that at all, of course, and you had to just do the best you could.  In the TV, you'll see here in a moment, once we get the ALSEP out, it turns out the Central Station is right near a big rock! (This rock is shown in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a>.)  The site I picked had a few of boulders, but it was the best I could find.&quot;]
120:42:53|Jones|alsj|That's not surprising; you were out in the middle of that ray from South Ray.  Did you ever do a deployment in a non-ideal place in training?
120:42:53|Duke|alsj|No.  It was always right out behind the MSOB (Manned Spacecraft Operations Building at the Cape).&quot;]
120:42:53|Jones|alsj|Did you get to the point where you knew how far away things were supposed to be from each other?  Or was it just to the end of the cables in certain directions?
120:42:53||alsj|The planned layout is shown on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev112.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-12</a> and, more clearly, in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp197.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.4-3</a> from the Lunar Surface procedures volume.

120:42:53|Duke|alsj|We had a minimum, I remember; but it was just basically to the end of the cables.  The thumper experiment - which was an active seismic experiment - was a hundred meters (true) or something.  He had to go out and lay a line; and that was probably the most critical.  Then I had to get the heat flow and the holes had to be so far apart.  In your mind's eye, you're just trying to figure this all out - will it all fit?  And, you know, you're looking at rolling terrain and there's a boulder here and a crater here and 'Well, I guess it's going to fit.'  You can't really sit there and spend too much time trying to measure it.&quot;]
120:42:53|Jones|alsj|Was the distance perception problem not as bad when you're looking at a confined area like that?  Could you judge distances reasonably well?&quot;]
120:42:53|Duke|alsj|Well, better, of course, because you're a little bit closer in.  But it was a problem.  I'm still not sure I judged the size of the rocks right.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
120:42:57||alsj|This rock is shown in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18348" target="new" target="alsj">18348</a>, which is a taken to the north across the top of the Central Station, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18356" target="new" target="alsj">18356</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18357" target="new" target="alsj">18357</a>.

120:42:57|Jones|alsj|Another question that this 'partially buried' brings up is that, at the 17 site, they kept running into rocks with flatish tops and maybe a few inches sticking up out of the regolith.  Did you see much of that, or was it mostly more angular and less buried?
120:42:57|Duke|alsj|We saw some.  In fact, one we picked up on the edge of Plum Crater was like that.  It was a rounded rock we called Big Muley.  It turned out it was big; only the top part was out.  I dug it out and it was like a watermelon.  But, mostly, they were rounded and it looked like they'd been a secondary boulder that had hit and then broken up?  And, as they hit again, they dug in.  And then, these fillets...A fillet was sort of a smooth...The regolith would sort of come up to a rock and we'd call it a fillet, like it would fill in around.  And it would be higher next to the rock and then it would slope away.
120:42:57|Jones|alsj|You just demonstrated that it wasn't a level, flat slope, but a curved one.
120:42:57|Duke|alsj|It seemed to me it was like a curve.
120:42:57|Jones|alsj|Definitely a steeper slope in close to the boulder.&quot;]
120:42:57||alsj|Charlie's answer suggests that they saw relatively few of the flat-topped, mostly-buried boulders like those seen by the 17 crew.  Big Muley, which they will find on the east rim of Plum Crater, is the large rock on the right side of the picture near the Rover in AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17800" target="new" target="alsj">17800</a> and, comparatively speaking, is only slightly buried.  In AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17804" target="new" target="alsj">17804</a> we see an example of a flat-topped, mostly-buried boulder on the southwest rim of Plum.]</i></blockquote>
120:44:01||alsj|A breccia is a rock formed out of pieces of other rocks during an impact.  In this case, the bulk of the rock is a black material and, embedded in it, are fragments of another rock type.]</i></blockquote>
120:45:12||alsj|If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
120:45:19||alsj|Apparently, John doesn't start driving until <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1204629" target="new" target="alsj">120:46:29</a>.  Here, he is probably turning the wheels with the handcontroller.  The fact that Charlie can see the Rover wheel indicates that, from the vicinity of the large rock, he can see the ground around the LM.
120:45:24||alsj|This is the likely explanation.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1193831" target="new" target="alsj">119:38:31</a>.]</i></blockquote>
120:46:20||alsj|John has started the drive.
120:47:28||alsj|Charlie may be standing north of the Central Station at the proposed start of the thumper geophone line, as shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp197.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.4-3</a> from the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.
120:47:34||alsj|According to Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 16 Preliminary Science Report</a>, Charlie will deploy the ALSEP Central Station about 90 meters SW of the LM.  At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1204804" target="new" target="alsj">120:48:04</a>, Charlie decides to move the Central Station about 30 feet (9 meters) from his present location and, if he is currently near the boulder, that final move may be in a southerly direction.  This would also be consistent with his statement at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1204208" target="new" target="alsj">120:42:08</a> that he was then at the 11 o'clock LM position (30 degrees south of west).  The final deployment site is at about the 10:30 position (45 degrees south of west).  In frame AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18359" target="new" target="alsj">18359</a>, a picture Charlie will take from the ALSEP site at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.thumper.html#1221349" target="new" target="alsj">122:13:49</a>, the hatch is clearly visible to the left of the vertical centerline on the Ascent Stage in a position consistent with the ALSEP being SW of the LM.]
120:47:34||alsj|According to the checklists, they had planned to deploy the Central Station west of the LM, but the terrain has forced him farther south.]
120:47:34|Young|tech|When I went back to reset the UV taking the Earth pictures of the geo-corona, I fouled up that procedure and had to do it all over again.  Even if we had done it right, Charlie would have been out at the site (first, because of the cumulative delays John was experiencing).  What we intended to do was take the Rover and run a little recon to pick a good place, if there was such a thing.  I have the feeling that, no matter what place we picked, it would have impacted one or the other experiments because of the blocks and because of all the craters out there.  I don't think, in a reasonable time, that we could have picked a better site than we did.  It's 20/20 hindsight for a man sitting on the ground with photographs to say, 'well, you should have put it over there.'  That's no good.
120:47:34|Duke|tech|Some of the hardest work I did was carrying that beauty out to where we finally deployed it.  I highly recommend that you put that thing off the left side of the LM if you can, if your experiments will allow you to.  Because, on lift-off, that MESA blanket (which is on the right side of the spacecraft) we had went sailing off right straight out front (west) just like it did on 15 and impacted about a hundred meters out in front of the LM.  It could have been another wipeout on the Central Station, like it almost was on 15.  So that's probably a good idea to put it (meaning the ALSEP) off to the left.
120:47:34|Young|tech|Yes; and I don't know why that MESA blanket did that.  Maybe we should take the MESA blanket off and stow it inside.
120:47:34||alsj|Here, John probably means stow the MESA blanket inside the Descent Stage, say in the now empty SEQ Bay.  Nothing of this sort was done on Apollo 17, nor was there any change in the planned ALSEP placement 300 feet west of the spacecraft.]
120:47:34|Young|tech|I don't know which MESA blanket it was.
120:47:34|Duke|tech|I don't either.  So, I think you're wasting you time pulling those blankets off.  If you just put the ALSEP off to the left, you don't have that problem.
120:47:34|Young|tech|There's no way it (meaning the MESA blanket) can get there.
120:47:58||alsj|John will drive on a heading of 290 to lay down tire tracks to guide his deployment of the thumper-geophone line.
120:48:07|Young|tech|There sure were a lot of rocks out at that site, and it wasn't the world's greatest ALSEP site.  After practicing for months on a flat terrain, with no craters, we ended up with a lot of craters and a lot of rocks and a lot of holes.  You sort of had to thread your way to where you were going to put each piece.  I'm not sure it was a good idea to have a rock between the Central Station and the PSE (and) right out there at the end of the LSM.  I'm not sure how that affects the data.&quot;]
120:48:07||alsj|The rock near the PSE is shown in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a> and in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18359" target="new" target="alsj">18359</a>; and the one near the LSM is just to the left of the instrument in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18349" target="new" target="alsj">18349</a>.]
120:48:07|Duke|tech|They said it was all right, John.
120:48:07|Young|tech|They said they were having thermal problems with the PSE.
120:48:07|Duke|tech|Already?  That's because there's dust on them (meaning on the experiments).
120:48:07|Young|tech|Yes.  And because I kept falling over rocks as I walked by it.
120:48:07|Duke|tech|That's the only flat spot I could find.&quot;]
120:48:07|Young|tech|I know, Charlie.  You did a good job.  I don't see how you could have done any better.&quot;]
120:48:07|Duke|tech|I wasn't about to carry the ALSEP all the way to Spook Crater&quot;]
120:48:07||alsj|The near rim of Spook is about a half kilometer WSW of the LM.
120:48:07|Young|tech|I'm glad you didn't carry it any farther.  If you had, when we did the ASE (Active Seismic Experiment) deployment (west of the Central Station), we'd have been down in a big hole.  We just barely missed being down in a big hole as it was.&quot;]
120:48:07||alsj|The Active Seismic Experiment is also known as the Thumper/Geophone.]</i></blockquote>
120:48:43||alsj|The temperature labels on the Cosmic Ray Experiment are shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf15-3.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">15-3</a> from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  At a particular temperature, some of the labels will be white and the others will have changed to black, thus making a coarsely-graded thermometer.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.
120:48:43|Young|tech|When I deployed it, I forgot to look at the temperature decals on them.  I'm sure as a result of our three (extra) revs, plus our time enroute, all those temperature decals were black (indicating a high temperature) before we ever got there.  I can't imagine that anybody would think they could put something on the side of the Lunar Module and expect not to see more than 140 degrees F.  It saw 140 degrees F during the Translunar coast, because the temperature was plus or minus 250 degrees (in direct sun and full shade, respectively).  They could stand about 120 or 130 before the experiment is ruined.  I never could understand why they were worried about thermal.  I still think that, long before we ever got to the Moon, thermal problems were a factor and that experiment was gone.  I don't know how you could have avoided that, unless you put a lot of insulation on the detector or put it in the MESA.

The experimenters wanted to have temperatures below 328 K (99F) but, after retrieval, two temperature labels inside the instrument indicated that peak temperatures of 339 (119 F) and 350 K (139F) were reached, respectively.  Thermal control had been attempted though the strategic use of materials that were highly reflective in the visible and were efficient radiators in the infrared, but the adopted measures were inadequate.]</i></blockquote>
120:50:11||alsj|John is probably returning from his drive along a heading of 290 to lay down tracks for the thumper/geophone line.
120:50:11|Muehlberger, from a 1997 e-mail message|alsj|This is the oldest lunar surface to be landed on - by any mission as it turned out.

120:52:38||alsj|Prior to Apollo 15, proper account was not taken of the fact that, in one-sixth g, the suits don't compress in the seat as much as they do in one g and, consequently, Scott and Irwin had to struggle to get their seatbelts firmly cinched.  As indicated previously, John and Charlie spent time in one-sixth-g airplane flights getting a good fit.

On Apollo 15, drilling the heat flow holes proved to be a time-consuming, frustrating task for Dave Scott and Charlie is hoping that his job will be easier.  In post-mission analysis, it was determined that Dave's troubles were caused by a faulty design of the core stems.  I asked Charlie if he did any testing of the new design.]
120:53:15|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  We tested it; and we had some special stuff (to drill in).  It was like clay, really, but it simulated the lunar regolith.&quot;]
120:53:15|Jones|alsj|In a big drum?
120:53:15|Duke|alsj|Yeah, in a big oil drum.  We had one of those actually out on the ALSEP training site, plus we did some of that inside.  We had this big pit, ten/twelve feet deep, filled with this clay-like material.  So, the changes we made worked real fine.
120:53:15|Jones|alsj|But, nonetheless, not having tried them on the Moon, you were just a little anxious that they were going to work?
120:53:15|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.

120:55:34||alsj|Fendell is panning along Stone Mountain.
120:55:34||alsj|I asked Charlie to point out the Cinco Craters that he and John will visit during EVA-2.
120:55:34|Duke|alsj|They're about 3/4 of the way up on the right there.
120:55:34|Jones|alsj|Below the break in slope.  That's a good climb.
120:55:34||alsj|Charlie later pointed out that the location of the Cincos can also be seen in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18339" target="new" target="alsj">18339</a>, the first of the photos he took of John jumping at the flag.  In that picture, the tips of the fingers of John's left hand delineate the upslope rim of the largest of the Cincos, Cinco A.  They will do Station 4 just to the right  of Cinco A.]
120:55:34|Duke|alsj|One thing, the picture that we took right after we landed as we looked out this left window (such as AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18300" target="new" target="alsj">18300</a>) showed a lot more features than this.  The higher the Sun got the more it washed out.  So it's hard to pick out the craters at this Sun angle, which is now ten hours or so after we landed.  When the Sun was low, there were a lot of features.  You saw a lot of lineations and striations across Stone Mountain from bottom to top.  Cinco Craters and the others were plainly visible when we landed.  But, the higher the Sun got, the less you could make out these landmarks.  And it really is important to have a low Sun angle, I think, to help you identify stuff.  Especially for landing.&quot;]
120:55:34||alsj|&quot;We learned that low-Sun angles give you the long shadows and definition of craters and stuff; it's really what your going to need, I think, for the long-duration missions where we stay up quite a while.  When we start going out with the Sun higher in the sky, it's going to be difficult to navigate to specific craters.  But, for specific landmarks like mountains and stuff like that, of course, you'll be able to do it. It's just amazing how the features seem to change with the angle of the Sun.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

120:57:13||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise stop.  He may have been looking for the LM.
120:57:36||alsj|This is Charlie's abbreviation of &quot;Dadgummit&quot;.  He is probably trying to release four <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-BoydBolts.html" target="new" target="alsj">Boyd bolts</a> that secure the probe package to the Heat Flow Electronics package as per Item 2 on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev113.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-13</a>.]

120:57:36||alsj|John's &quot;nothing&quot; sounds more like &quot;Nah-thing&quot; and causes some confusion in Houston.  He is doing the steps under &quot;Connect RTG&quot; on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp049.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-17</a>.]

Charlie is watching, probably to make sure he understands the procedure in case he has to make the connection during the mission.]
120:57:36||alsj|Fendell starts a slow, clockwise pan with frequent pauses so the geologists in the Backroom in Houston can take Polaroid shots of their monitor.
120:59:05||alsj|I have been unable to find, in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, a decal that might have been on the probe package.  It may have been added late in training after Charlie had trouble getting the probe wires crossed.
120:59:05||alsj|Fendell has the South Ray ejecta blanket in view.
120:59:39||alsj|AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18368" target="new" target="alsj">18368</a> is a photo of the west probe and shows the 5-meter crater at the center of the frame.  The object in the middle distance beyond and to the left of the crater is the jack with which Charlie will remove the deep core.  The South Ray ejecta blanket is just below the distant hills.  Kenesaw is the hill furthest left.]</i></blockquote>
121:00:12||alsj|In Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp197.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.4-3</a> from the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, the LSM is the three-armed instrument 35 feet northwest of the west (No. 1) heat flow probe.  The Portable Magnetometer is a separate instrument that is mounted on the back of the Rover and will be used at several of the geology stops.
121:00:12||alsj|The crew is now in view.  John is working at the Central Station, connecting the RTG cable as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp051.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-18</a>; and Charlie is closer to the Rover, working with the Heat Flow equipment.  The large boulder north of the Central Station is  beyond it to the right and Smoky Mountain is in the distance.  Note that the Central Station is tipped up so that what will be the back-bottom edge is upright.  This positioning allows John to connect the RTG cable without having to get close to the ground.  AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18371" target="new" target="alsj">18371</a> shows the RTG and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18348" target="new" target="alsj">18348</a> shows the Central Station in its final configuration.  In the latter picture, the RTG cable is the thick, round one coming off the lower-left corner.  Charlie moves east of the HFE package to position the up-Sun probe.] </i></blockquote>
121:00:22||alsj|Charlie is sidestepping to his right as he lays out the cable for the up-Sun probe.
121:00:34||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise stop.  The LM can be seen across the top of the console.
121:00:34||alsj|Off-camera, Charlie heads for the Rover to get the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../drill_21.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">drill</a>.   His footprints to and from the Rover can be seen in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18365" target="new" target="alsj">18365</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18366" target="new" target="alsj">18366</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18367" target="new" target="alsj">18367</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18368" target="new" target="alsj">18368</a>.  These photos also show the drill and the Heat Flow Electronics package]</i></blockquote>
121:00:58||alsj|Readers should note that John is unable to reach his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink valve</a> and will go thirsty for the entire EVA.
121:00:58||alsj|Fendell pans counter-clockwise and finds Charlie at his seat, taking the seatbelt off the drill which rode out to the ALSEP site on the LMP seat.
121:01:18||alsj|Fendell pans counter-clockwise past John, who is walking over to the RTG.  Fendell stops panning with the camera roughly centered on the boulder which is between the drill stem rack and the LSM on the right side of AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18388" target="new" target="alsj">18388</a>.  To the right of John in this picture we see the drill, the Heat Flow Electronics package, the RTG and, at the right edge of the picture, the Central Station.  In the background, particularly on the right side of the picture, note the east-west ridge that forms the local horizon.]</i></blockquote>
121:01:41||alsj|Fendell has pulled back on the zoom and moved his aim to the right.  John is using a Universal Handling Tool (UHT) to straighten the RTG cable and is trying to get it to lay flat on the ground.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy35.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 35</a> in Judy Allton's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/Welcome.html" target="new" target="alsj">Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools and Containers</a> shows a UHT with an Apollo 17 LRV sampler attached to the business end.  Without the LRV sampler, the UHT is used to remove <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-BoydBolts.html" target="new" target="alsj">Boyd bolts</a> and, when fitted into an adapter socket, can be used to carry equipment.]</i></blockquote>
121:01:59|Duke|alsj|That was a premonition that things were really stiff.
121:01:59||alsj|Later in the ALSEP deployment, John will catch his foot under the cable connecting the HFE and the Central Station and will pull it loose.
121:01:59||alsj|John rests the UHT against the far side of the RTG.
121:02:10||alsj|Fendell zooms in on John who leans down, gets the UHT, and starts loosening the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-BoydBolts.html" target="new" target="alsj">Boyd bolts</a> that secure the Central Station antenna packages on the RTG pallet.  In releasing a Boyd bolt, John only has to make about a quarter turn with the UHT.  The Heat Flow Electronics package is in the foreground with a second UHT sticking up into the air.  Charlie used that UHT to carry the Heat Flow package out from the Central Station.
121:02:34||alsj|John reaches down and takes two packages off the RTG pallet, heads toward the Central Station, but then stops to look at the base of the RTG pallet.
121:03:34||alsj|Charlie has backed into the field-of-view and we get an out-of-focus look at a recharge decal on the back of his PLSS. </i></blockquote>
121:03:51||alsj|Charlie has backed up a little farther and we see him separating the jack from the drill-stem rack.
121:04:06||alsj|Charlie sets the drill-stem rack on the ground next to the Rover, but it promptly falls over.
121:04:23||alsj|Charlie lays the jack on his seat and goes to his knees to retrieve the core caps.  Although he is too close to the TV for us to see much of what he is doing, he is undoubtedly holding onto the Rover as kneels. </i></blockquote>
121:04:23||alsj|Charlie takes a few steps away from the Rover, bends his knees and bobs down to his left to retrieve the rack.  The  relatively large size of the rack undoubtedly made this grab relatively easy. </i></blockquote>
121:04:44||alsj|Charlie sets the rack down again.  It starts to tip but he grabs it and, after a moment, gets it to stay upright. </i></blockquote>
121:04:51||alsj|Charlie turns to his left and starts away from the Rover toward the Heat Flow equipment.  He has the core stem bag and the drill and grabs the rack as he goes by.  He has left the jack on the seat.  As he straightens up after grabbing the rack, he comes upon a football-sized rock, shifts his weight onto his left foot, raises his right foot, and hops past  the rock.  He then resumes his signature sideways hop.
121:05:36||alsj|This is the crater just beyond the drill in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18365" target="new" target="alsj">18365</a>.  Note the depth of his footprints in the soft soil on the rim closest to the Rover.]
121:05:36||alsj|Fendell follows Charlie.
121:05:49||alsj|Charlie goes down into another shallow crater and then out the far side.  This is the crater on the left side of AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18368" target="new" target="alsj">18368</a>. The 5-meter crater Charlie described earlier is at the center of the picture.]</i></blockquote>
121:06:08||alsj|Charlie sets the rack down and then hops around to the east side of it.
121:06:28||alsj|Charlie is holding the drill by a wire loop and puts the drill down so that he can remove the drill stems from the bag.
121:06:29||alsj|Charlie is struggling to loosen the Velcro on the core stem bag.
121:07:32||alsj|Charlie gets the top of the bag off and flings it, with an underhand motion, off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>
121:07:32||alsj|Charlie removes one drill stem from the bag and then lays the rest on the rack.
121:07:51||alsj|Charlie tries to thread the drill stem into the drill but without luck.  The stems have a single thread which circles the stem in a rise of about a centimeter and, in shirtsleeves, it is trivial to get them threaded.  Here, Charlie's finger motions are restricted by the bulky <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a> and his arm motions are restricted by the pressure suit.  All of the astronauts who tried this - Scott, Duke, and Cernan - had trouble.
121:08:31||alsj|On his fourth attempt to get the stem threaded, Charlie thinks he has succeeded and picks up the drill by the wire loop, only to have the stem detach.  He puts the drill down again, moves around to the northeast of it - probably to get a better view - and finally gets the stem threaded. This first stem is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp055.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">54 inches (137 cm) long</a>.
121:09:15||alsj|Charlie picks up the drill by grabbing the stem just above the chuck, turns the assembly over and positions the bit in the ground next to the probe he laid down previously.
121:09:20||alsj|Charlie pushes the bit a few inches into the ground, removes a thermal cover from the drill and tosses it off-camera to our left.
121:09:40||alsj|Charlie gets about a foot of penetration; but, then, the rate slows dramatically.  Something similar happened on Apollo 15 when the joint between the first and second drill stems went into the surface but, in that case, the cause was a faulty drill-stem design which prevented the cuttings from flowing upward past the joint.  The drill stems were re-designed after Apollo 15.  In Houston, someone comments, &quot;Looks like he hit a rock&quot;.
121:10:13||alsj|Charlie is speculating that, because the surface is littered with rocks, there are numerous subsurface rocks as well.]
121:10:13||alsj|Charlie finishes the first stem.
121:10:25||alsj|This first stem is about a meter long.
121:10:32||alsj|John is deploying the Passive Seismic Experiment as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp051.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-19</a>.]
121:10:32||alsj|Charlie has propped the toes of his left boot on the drill stem, with his heel pressed in the ground, in an attempt to prevent the stem from turning when he tries to take the drill off.
121:10:37|Duke|alsj|Sometimes the foot worked.  In training, it would work real good.
121:10:37||alsj|Charlie goes to the rack to get the wrench, a tool that was added to the drilling kit as a result of the Apollo 15 experience.  The wrench is slightly out of reach and, to get it, he picks up the rack, takes the wrench off, and resets the rack on the ground.
121:11:01||alsj|Charlie gets into position a meter or more from the drill, leans forward and puts his left hand on the drill to support himself while he reaches down with his right hand and engages the wrench on the drill stem.  He then stands up, blocks the wrench with the outside of his left leg, and twists the drill off.
121:11:39||alsj|Charlie gets the drill off, grabs it by the wire loop and puts it down, well out of the way.
121:11:53||alsj|Charlie bobs down and tries a dynamic grab but he misses the wrench.  The suit forces him upright.  He moves around the drill-stem and bobs down into what might be described as a partial kneel and grabs the wrench successfully.
121:12:04|Jones|alsj|The second time, you had your right leg well forward and the left leg was back - with the knee almost touching.  It looked like you were fairly stable.
121:12:04|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  I was.
121:12:04||alsj|With the wrench in hand, he lets himself spring upright.
121:12:11||alsj|Like the drill, the wrench has a wire-loop on the handle which Charlie now uses to hang the wrench on the rack.
121:12:13||alsj|There are ballet references in the Apollo 17 transcript starting at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.trvsta4.html#1445623" target="alsj">144:56:23</a>.  Indeed, the crater at Apollo 17 Station 3 is now known as Ballet Crater.]</i></blockquote>
121:12:41||alsj|Charlie took a second, shorter drill-stem out of the bag and threaded it onto the one in the ground without any problem.]</i></blockquote>
121:12:47||alsj|Charlie grabs the drill by the wire loop and attaches it to the top of the second drill stem.
121:13:11|Duke|alsj|Mark isn't going to be so happy in a little while.
121:13:17||alsj|Charlie has turned the drill a number of times to get it seated and, to stop the drill stem from turning with it, he grabs the stem with his right hand and turns it through three more complete revolutions.  Once satisfied, he grabs the handles so that he can start drilling again.
121:13:17||alsj|Progress slows noticeably when the joint between the two stems goes into the ground.
121:14:08||alsj|It does look like Charlie is leaning on the drill.  His feet are slightly back and his legs are straight.  As the drill gets below waist, he bends his knees slightly so that he can keep his grip on the drill without putting more weight on it.  After a few seconds, he splays his feet to the side to get lower still.]</i></blockquote>
121:14:11||alsj|Charlie has finished the second stem.  He jumps to his feet with ease and goes to the rack to get the wrench.
121:14:11||alsj|Charlie is probably referring to a crater just north of the spacecraft with blocky ejecta on the rim.  He described the crater at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html#1051457" target="new" target="alsj">105:14:57</a>, shortly after the landing.  It is probably the crater above the thruster on the right side of AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18307" target="new" target="alsj">18307</a>.
121:14:11||alsj|Charlie leans on the drill and attaches the wrench without difficulty.  He then blocks it with his left leg and starts twisting the drill off.  It takes quite a bit of force to get it to start turning.]</i></blockquote>
121:14:31||alsj|It takes a bit less then two complete revolution of the drill before it comes off the stem.  Charlie puts the drill off to the side and positions himself to get the wrench off.
121:14:31||alsj|Charlie jumps slightly, gets his left leg behind him, bends his right knee, and bobs down to get the wrench.  Charlie's left knee doesn't get quite low enough to touch the ground and, at the lowest point, he grabs the wrench without difficulty and hops back up.
121:15:18||alsj|Charlie stows the wrench on the rack, gets a third drill stem.
121:15:36||alsj|Charlie gets the third stem threaded without trouble.  He seats it in the stem in the ground and them uses the tips of the fingers on both hands to do the threading.  In the process, he is using small arm motions to do the threading and doesn't have to flex the glove.
121:15:48||alsj|Off-camera, John is completing the steps under &quot;Deploy PSE&quot; on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp051.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-19</a>.  In his next transmission, he will &quot;Report sun compass align&quot;.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf9-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">9-1</a> from the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> is a sketch showing the alignment mechanisms on the top of the instrument, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-PSEstool.html" target="new" target="alsj">stool</a> on which it sits, and the aluminized Mylar skirt that provides thermal protection.

In <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a>, the object on top that looks like  a cricket wicket is the combination gnomon and handle.  The level bubble is in the white cup just to the left of the gnomon.  The RTG is beyond the Central Station to the left and the upright object to the right of the Central Station is an anchoring post for the thumper-geophone line which runs west from the anchor.  The cable running past the RTG is the LSM cable and the cable going off to the south is the Heat Flow cable which, by the time this picture was taken, had already been broken.]
121:15:48||alsj|In Houston, EVA notes to Flight that they &quot;sure don't know what the Commander's doing.&quot;  As so often happens in such circumstances, the next transmission is from John.
121:16:11||alsj|Because Experiments was talking to Flight, no one in Houston is sure they heard what John said and they ask Tony to get confirmation.
121:16:34||alsj|In Houston, they think John is talking about the PSE Sun compass but aren't sure.  However, before Tony can ask, John's next transmission tells them where he is on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp051.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-19</a>.
121:16:34||alsj|On camera, Charlie has nearly finished the third drill stem.  He has his weight on his right leg, with the knee bent and his left leg out behind him.  With his hands on the drill, he looks very stable.
121:17:20||alsj|In Houston, Experiments is telling Flight that they want the gnomon shadow on 090 on the Sun compass. </i></blockquote>
121:17:35||alsj|In Houston, Flight points out that John probably has the thermal skirt out and asks Experiments if they really want him to re-align the instrument.  Re-alignment would require that John move the skirt and there would be a considerable risk of getting dirt on it.  Under those circumstances, Experiments decides they don't want a re-alignment.
121:17:35|Young|tech|The PSE deployed normally.  I had some misgivings about where we put it; but, we leveled it and deployed the thermal skirt.  And we padded it (meaning the dirt under the stool) so that it would be level.  The last picture I saw of it (see, for example, AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18359" target="new" target="alsj">18359</a>) shows that it is up, off the ground, a little bit (where the cable emerges from under the skirt) and I don't know what to tell them (the PSE experimenters) about that because we sure made an effort to make sure it was flat.  We did go back and check it three or four times during the mission, but it was up off the ground on one side.  Maybe that will give them a thermal problem.  With that rock between the PSE and the Central Station (see AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a>), walking on one side or the other of that rock would tend to get a little dirt on the skirt.  But it was level and they should be getting good data.&quot;]
121:17:35||alsj|Charlie has attached the wrench to the drill stems and starts to twist the drill off.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom and shifts his aim to the right so they can see John.
121:18:02||alsj|Fendell gets John centered and zooms in.  John is standing next to the Central Station and has his back to us.  He has just removed a dust cover from the thumper/geophone package and tosses the cover off to the north.  We get to see the entire trajectory.  Note that John has not yet raised the top of the Central Station.  He will do that after he removes the mortar package and the Lunar Surface Magnetometer.  The PSE is on the right side of the TV picture.
121:18:02||alsj|John steps over a cable and then backs away from the Central Station to the east, paying out the thumper/geophone cable.
121:18:56||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the Central Station, just as it rotates a few degrees counter clockwise because of unavoidable tension in the thumper/geophone cable.
121:19:22||alsj|The thumper/geophone cable has gotten fouled on the thumper assembly John is holding.  The thumper assembly is shown in Figure 10-2 from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> and the conical housing on the bottom contains a cable reel.  Just before his next transmission, John gets the cable cleared and resumes the deployment, angling to the north as he continues to back away from the Central Station.  He reaches the mortar package subpallet - which Charlie had previously placed northeast of the Central Station as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev113.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-13</a> - and rests the thumper assembly on it.
121:19:52||alsj|John heads for the Central Station, reading his checklist as he goes.  He will get the mortar package off the top of the Central Station and, as per the last item on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp051.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-19</a>, will take it NNE of the subpallet. </i></blockquote>
121:20:01||alsj|This is a training joke of some sort.  There is only one rammer and Charlie is using it to emplace a heat flow probe in the first hole.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf9-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">9-1</a> from the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> shows the multi-element probe.
121:20:50||alsj|Dave Scott drilled two heat flow holes at Apollo 15 site, which was on the mare.  Charlie also plans to drill two holes but, here, his &quot;first one&quot; refers to a thermal shield on the top of the deepest gauge.  He is using marks on the rammer to judge emplacement depth.
121:21:08||alsj|The heat flow readings at the Apollo 15 site were higher than expected and, consequently, the experimenters are very interested in the Apollo 16 results.
121:21:21||alsj|While Charlie was talking, John lifted the mortar package off the top of the Central Station. As he turns to his right and takes his first step toward the subpallet, we can see his trailing right foot catch a ribbon cable. The initial, telltale motion of the cable is subtle but, as he brings his left foot forward, we can clearly see the cable caught on his foot.  As he goes between the Central Station, he lifts his right foot to clear another cable - as he had done previously -  and, either because of tension on the cable draped on his left foot or because  he catches his left toe on something, he stumbles slightly. Recovering from the stumble, he bends his right knee enough that his left knee almost touches the ground.  He steps forward with his left foot and, again with his right,  Fendell tilts the TV down slightly, perhaps  having seen the cable caught on John's foot.  As John makes a final step with his left, he appears to feel tension in the cable and, as he turns to his left to see what's happening, the cable pulls taut and tears loose from the base of the Central Station.  John hops backwards away from the Central Station to get the cable off his boot and surveys the damage.]</i></blockquote>
121:21:49||alsj|John puts the mortar package down and goes to his right knee to try to get the end of the heat flow cable.  He rises without it.
121:21:58||alsj|John kicks the end of the cable toward the rock and then gets down on his left knee, steadying himself with his left hand on the rock and his right leg out to the side.  He picks up the severed end of the cable.
121:22:02||alsj|John rises easily, having moved his right foot slightly forward and inward, rocks his torso back far enough that he can push himself upward with his right legs and, then, merely has to step forward to get his feet under him.  All of his movements are amazingly stable.
121:22:17||alsj|John drops to his knees at the back of the Central Station, puts his left hand on a protruding piece of attachment hardware,  and examines the connector.  Photo AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18348" target="new" target="alsj">18348</a> is a close-up of the end of the cable and the connector.]</i></blockquote>
121:22:20||alsj|John rotates back to get his center-of-gravity over his feet and rises  easily, finishing off with a slight hop backwards to get his balance.
121:22:36||alsj|John starts walking toward the mortar package; and Charlie comes into view, going to the Central Station to inspect the damage.
121:22:42||alsj|To get past the rock, John actually steps up on it and over.  To my knowledge, this is the only record in Apollo of someone stepping up on something.  The rock is approximately 20 centimeters tall and is equivalent to the rise of an ordinary household step.
121:23:11||alsj|Fendell follows John, who is backing away from the Central Station, paying out the mortar package cables. The two-meter boulder, that Charlie described at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.alsepoff.html#1204046" target="new" target="alsj">120:40:46</a>, is beyond John.]</i></blockquote>
121:23:34||alsj|In Houston, Jim Lovell, the spokesman for the Science Support Room, tells Flight, &quot;That might be a detachable connector.  We're looking at it right now.  We might want them to go back and look at it.&quot;
121:23:54||alsj|John deploys the legs on the mortar package.  This takes him quite a while but he gets them out eventually and places the package on the ground.  Photos AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18379" target="new" target="alsj">18379</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18380" target="new" target="alsj">18380</a> show the mortar package in it's final configuration.]
121:23:54|Young|tech|One of the legs on the mortar package hung up.  I couldn't extend it.  I can show whoever wants to know how that pin was hung up.  If I had a pair of tweezers, I could have gotten in there and pulled the pin.  But, with the pressure-suit <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">glove</a>, I couldn't get my fingers in there to do it.  So, we deployed it in the ground with three legs extended. </i></blockquote>
121:24:53||alsj|John goes to the north side of the Central Station and, once there, uses the UHT to flip a cloth cover out of the way to the north.  We get to see the entire flight.
121:24:53||alsj|Charlie and I stopped to discuss the loss of the heat flow experiment.
121:24:53|Duke|alsj|This was probably the biggest strain that I think I had in the whole flight - when he pulled that loose.  It was just a bitter pill to swallow, to have that happen.
121:24:53|Jones|alsj|The first time I heard this, it seemed to me that the level of enthusiasm dropped precipitously for five or ten minutes.
121:24:53|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah; it did.  It did until we got over this, 'cause it was a big loss.  We'd worked hard on that.  You know, we re-designed the whole experiment, really, as far as the drill goes and the tubes (meaning the drill stems) and the wrench and everything.  So I really had to swallow hard.
121:24:53|Jones|alsj|Do you remember anything about how you got yourself back on track?
121:24:53|Duke|alsj|No; we just got back to work.  And I did the deep core, which helped.  They said they'd work on it; and they said we might be able to fix it and don't worry now.
121:24:53|Jones|alsj|It is a wonder that it didn't happen to somebody before this.  Did you and John talk about this when you got back in, after you got off mike?
121:24:53|Duke|alsj|I don't remember.  I think we probably bitched about it - the spaghetti and the memory of the things and that they won't lie flat.  We'll have to wait to the debriefing to see if we talk about it.
121:24:53|Jones|alsj|For somebody who wasn't involved, it just seemed like a heart-wrenching experience.  And I, for one, admire the way the two of you were able to get it back together in just a few minutes and get on with it.
121:24:53|Duke|alsj|Well, you've only got so much time on each EVA and you've got so much to do, you might as well fill it in with something instead of just standing around and feeling sorry for yourself.  We got to work.
121:24:53|Young|tech|My feeling is: that kind thing is almost unavoidable.  If the cables are way up off the ground, you never knew whether you were stepping on them or not.  When you are standing in one-sixth gravity with a backpack (and RCU) on, you're looking about 3 to 4 inches in front of your toes - unless you make a positive effort to look over at them.  Every one of those cables had a memory and were all at some distance off the surface.  If you want to make that whole business compatible with the suit operation - when you run into the cable - it will be strong enough that it does something like pull the Central Station a little so that you know you're moving something.  Maybe it should be such that it can stand a tangle and trip.  That cable, evidently, was really flimsy.  Some cables allowed you to do that.  I was pulling the Active Seismic experiment around (at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1211902" target="new" target="alsj">121:19:02</a>) and that cable was on there so taut that I actually moved the Central Station and had to go back and adjust it.  I didn't pull the PSE cable; but I had the feeling that, if I had, it would have moved the Central Station.  The LSM cable was very strong.  But that (Heat Flow) cable wasn't.  I didn't know I'd done it.  And I certainly didn't mean to.
121:24:53|Slayton|tech|We should have helped you from the ground, some, on that.  You can go back and look at the color TV and we could see it (especially the orange glint off the ribbon cable).  The CapCom was looking at the black &amp; white set and it isn't very obvious on black &amp; white.  Besides the time delay, we had the wrong flight display up.
121:24:53||alsj|I do not know exactly what Deke means by &quot;we had the wrong flight display up&quot;, but it suggests that key people weren't looking at the TV picture.
121:24:53|Young|tech|It's an 8-second time delay for the whole thing to get through.  You can probably do a lot of damage in 8 seconds.
121:24:53||alsj|The theoretical communications round-trip is about 2.67 seconds, but the color-wheel technology used to produce the color TV picture introduced an additional delay.  However, according to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new" target="alsj">Ed Fendell</a>, the added delay was only about 0.5 seconds.  John is probably overstating the delay, perhaps to make a point.
121:24:53||alsj|Journal Contributor Markus Mehring notes that John may be remembering the delay seen by the public TV audience and not the delay seen by people in the MOCR.  &quot;It seems as if the broadcast from the Westinghouse color camera in the CSM took roughly 10 seconds to be prepared to commercial TV-standards for public broadcast. This was not necessarily the case for the RCA camera system on the Rover, though, which basically was fully capable of sending in NTSC. What the public saw from the Rover camera merely had an extra 2-second delay (making a total delay of 2.67 seconds plus 2 seconds) because the signal went over a loop between two tape-recorders for synchronization purposes on the broadcasting side.  Note that this applies to public broadcast only, while Houston had the direct signal, since they didn't need to cope with TV-standard limitations and thus could skip this signal conversion. Either the nearly 5-second delay for the Rover picture as seen by the public or the corresponding 10-second delay for the CSM picture could be the source of  Young's '8-second delay'.&quot;
121:24:53|Slayton|tech|That's right.  It probably would have been too late, anyway.  But, it might not have been.&quot;]
121:24:53|Young|tech|It was sure a tragedy.  If it had just moved the Central Station before it broke.  I would have stopped right there and fixed it.
121:24:53|Duke|tech|Every one of those cables had a memory.  Every one of them were off the ground.
121:24:53|Young|tech|A guy really can't lift his feet too high around the Central Station because, when he does, he kicks dirt all over the PSE.  It was a bad thing; but I still think it (the cable) was incompatible with the kind of limitations that we were working with in the pressure suit.  I blew it.  I tripped over the whole thing; but I didn't even know that I had done it.  I was completely out as far as the Active Seismic Experiment (subpallet) when I looked around and saw this cable following me.
121:24:53|Duke|tech|It wasn't your fault.&quot;]
121:24:53|Young|tech|It was my fault.  I didn't know I did it.
121:24:53||alsj|Readers may also wish to examine an Apollo 15 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15v.1243908.rm" target="new" target="alsj">video clip</a> which shows Jim Irwin losing his balance at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.alsepdep.html#1244105" target="new" target="alsj">124:41:05</a> while he was attaching the SIDE cable to the Central Station.  Dave had already attached the heat flow cable and it is easy to imagine that Jim narrowly avoided a loss.
||alsj|Brian McInall has created a planimetric map of the ALSEP deployment (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ALSEP-DeploymentPlanimetricMapLROC-M175179080LR_Jan2017.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10 Mb</a>).
||alsj|Having abandoned the Heat Flow Experiment, Charlie skips over the procedures on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev114.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-14</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev115.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-15</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev116.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-16</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev117.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-17</a> and starts the deep core as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev118.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-18</a>.] </i></blockquote>
121:25:36||alsj|Charlie will now drill a deep core hole, using four 60-cm stem sections.  After drilling the hole, he will use a jack-and-treadle to extract the core and then will break the individual stems loose and cap them. See Brian McInall's ALSEP Deployment Planimetric Map (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ALSEP-DeploymentPlanimetricMapLROC-M175179080LR_Jan2017.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10 Mb</a>).
121:25:36||alsj|Houston is still trying to decide if Charlie should go ahead and drill the core hole; but he is way out in front of them.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom and pans right.  He finds Charlie just as he stabs the first stem in the ground and starts to drill.
121:25:36||alsj|The first drill stem went in in just under five seconds.  Charlie goes for the wrench as Fendell zooms in on him. Charlie has only left himself about 10 cm of stem above ground.
121:26:04||alsj|A slower drilling rate will yield a more compact core that will better preserve layering in the soil.
121:26:22||alsj|They would have to bundle the cable around the box and then remove the probe from the first hole and bundle that so that the entire package would be small enough to get through the hatch.  Such a procedure would be time consuming and might not be successful.
121:26:22||alsj|Charlie leans forward with his left hand on the drill and his feet out behind him and puts the wrench on the core stem.  He gets up and tries to break the drill free.  Apparently, the wrench is not gripping, because the drill turns freely.
121:26:22||alsj|In the background, John carries the magnetometer west of the Central Station and puts it down, out of the way, as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp053.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-20</a>.  Next, he will erect the Central Station.]
121:26:22||alsj|Charlie goes to his knees to re-position the wrench.  It appears that, because of the internal pressure of the suit, he isn't able to get all of his weight on his knees and, while he is down, supports himself with his right hand on the drill.  He is unable to get the wrench on the stem and gets to his feet to adjust it.
121:27:19||alsj|Charlie leans on the drill and reaches down with his right hand, this time, to attach the wrench.  He starts to lose his balance and begins to rotate to his right.  He hops forward on his right leg and regains his balance.]
121:27:19||alsj|Fendell pans right to watch John.
121:27:19||alsj|In Houston, Lovell tells Flight that the Science Support Room would like to have either John or Charlie spend a minute or two examining the Heat Flow connector and, if possible, give Houston a TV close-up of it.  Fendell goes to maximum zoom and the idea of a TV close-up is quickly abandoned.  Tony England joins the conversation and points out that John has already described the break twice and that there is nothing to be gained from another examination.
121:27:19||alsj|As per Item 2 under &quot;Erect C/S&quot; on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp053.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-20</a>, John is using the UHT to release five <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-BoydBolts.html" target="new" target="alsj">Boyd bolts</a> on the south side of the Central Station.  After he gets those, he uses the UHT to try to clear the various ribbon cables off the top of the Central Station so that they won't be in the way when he finally raises it.]
121:27:19||alsj|Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#72HC137" target="new" target="alsj">72-HC-137</a> shows John at an earlier part of the ALSEP deployment and a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16boyds.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">labeled detail</a> indicates the locations of four of the many Boyd bolts. </i></blockquote>
121:29:00||alsj|John releases <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-BoydBolts.html" target="new" target="alsj">Boyd bolts</a> on the east side of the Central Station and then goes around the west side - stepping carefully over the magnetometer and RTG cables - as per the first item on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp053.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-21</a>.] </i></blockquote>
121:29:36|Duke|tech|The only problem I really had (with the core) was when I tried to get the drill head off to add another stem.  It seemed to be real tight and didn't want to unscrew (from the stems).  That happened on all three sections.  I really don't know why.  I checked and it didn't look like I was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galling" target="new" target="alsj">galling</a> any of the threads.  The stem threads on the stem side all looked clean and weren't galled.  When I put them stem to stem, they went together real easy,  but, when I tried to get the drill head off, it was hard to get off. But, once I broke it loose, it unwound easily.    I had to really make a conscious effort to make sure that the drill stem did not unscrew (meaning turn) in the ground.    It really wanted to back off.  When I tried to put the wrench on it and unscrew the drill, the whole thing would turn and I really had to make an effort to stop that.
121:29:52||alsj|Charlie has fallen and we see a spray of dust at the bottom of the TV picture.
121:29:56||alsj|John may have seen Charlie's fall and, if so, is offering to help him get up.
121:29:56||alsj|Fendell pans left to find Charlie.  He is on his knees, leaning far forward with his right hand on the protruding core stem.  He is trying to attach the wrench with his left hand.  He seems to give up on the wrench for the moment and, in trying to get up, he lifts off his knees, pulls his feet in toward the core stem, and kneels again - all the while keeping his right hand on the core stem.  Finally, he releases his grip, pushes up with his legs, and then runs forward to get his balance.  In comparison with John's easy rise at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.heatflow.html#1212205" target="new" target="alsj">121:22:05</a>, Charlie has expended a lot of excess energy.]</i></blockquote>
121:30:17||alsj|Fendell pans right to watch John, who is still working at the north side of the Central Station.  He discards what is probably the cover mentioned in Item 4 on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp053.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-21</a>.  This is probably one of the objects in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18345" target="new" target="alsj">18345</a>.  John then uses the UHT to pull the lanyard mentioned in Item 4.]
121:30:17||alsj|Fendell pans left to watch Charlie as he attaches the drill to the drill string.  It looks as though he has attached two sections to the one in the ground.
121:31:56||alsj|Charlie attaches the wrench to the drill string at about waist height to keep the stems from turning as he locks the drill on.
121:32:33||alsj|Tony is probably referring to Charlie's new wrench procedure.  After some struggles, Charlie gets the drill on to his satisfaction and stow the wrench on the rack.]
121:32:33|Jones|alsj|15 and 17, Dave and Gene (the Commanders) did the drilling.  Do you remember any discussions on how the tasks were going to get split up?
121:32:33|Duke|alsj|No.  (Pause)  I think I followed the development of the drill and the changes of it, so it just seemed like I was the appropriate person to do it.
121:33:34||alsj|This drilling session took about 52 seconds.  The slower pace was partly due to Charlie's efforts to restrain the drill but, also, was due to the fact that, below a few inches, the soil is very compact.  Charlie has left perhaps 30 cm of core stem sticking out of the ground so that he won't have to get quite so low to attach the wrench.
121:34:34||alsj|Fendell pans right and finds John standing on the south side of the now-erect Central Station.  Readers should note that Charlie has regained his composure.  John won't rejoin the joking for another half hour or so.
121:35:09||alsj|John detaches the Central Station antenna which has been lying on the top.  He pulls something off the side of the Central Station and drops it, and then consults his checklist before he starts circling the Central Station to his left to adjust the side curtains.  These curtains provide thermal protection for the cavity in the center of the Station and, presumably, provide a stable thermal environment for the electronics in the base of the Station.  While working on the northeast corner, he removes and discards another cover or piece of packaging material.  This may be one of the objects in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18345" target="new" target="alsj">18345</a>.]
121:35:09||alsj|We can hear Charlie's breathing as he struggles with the drill.]</i></blockquote>
121:36:57||alsj|Dave Scott had a terrible time removing the deep core. He did not have a jack and, in the end, he and Jim Irwin had to put their shoulders under the drill handle and lift with their legs to pry it out. Charlie will have a much easier time.]
121:36:57||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-3b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3b</a> from the Apollo 16 Mission Report, Charlie's peak heart rate during this period is over 120 beats per minute.  In Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-3a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3a</a>, we see that John's heart rate has been under 90 throughout most of the ALSEP deployment.]</i></blockquote>
121:36:57||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds Charlie threading the fourth core stem.  Charlie isn't sure it's secure and drops to his knees, holding onto the drill string with his right hand.  After checking the joint, he rises vertically, using the drill string to keep himself steady and, as he gets vertical, kicking his feet under himself.  This is a good illustration that it is stability and not strength that is the key factor in getting up.  Once up, Charlie grabs the drill.]</i></blockquote>
121:37:52||alsj|Charlie raps the drill a few times with his hand to clean the dust off.  This time, he gets the drill on without having to hold the string with either his hand or the wrench.]</i></blockquote>
121:39:45||alsj|Charlie backs away to make sure he has left about 8 inches (20 cm) of stem protruding.
121:39:54||alsj|Charlie grabs the handles and pulls up with some force and he runs the drill.  He lifts the drill about 10 to 20 cm.
121:40:03||alsj|Charlie gets his hands under the handles and, without the drill running, tries to lift it.  He gets only an inch or two.]</i></blockquote>
121:40:09||alsj|Charlie pulls two more times and makes only a little more progress.  The drill handles are at about hip height.]</i></blockquote>
121:40:40|Duke|tech|Once I had it in, I did 15 seconds of clearing the flutes.  While I was doing that, I tried to pull up and the thing just came right on out of the ground.  I pulled up 4 or 5 inches.  It was coming out easy.  I said, 'Man, it is going to be a piece of cake to get this out of the ground.  I stopped the flute-clearing activity and then I tried to pull it out of the ground. Boy, I couldn't budge it.  I took the drill head off, capped it, and used the jack on it.&quot;]
121:40:40||alsj|Fendell pans right and finds John standing on the north side of the Central Station.  He has attached the C/S antenna as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp055.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-23</a>.

121:41:34||alsj|We see John using the gimbal assembly to aim the Central Station antenna.  With the station level and aligned, he can go to pre-determined values of azimuth and elevation which are listed on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp055.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-23</a>.]
121:41:34||alsj|Fendell pans left to watch Charlie.
121:41:52||alsj|Charlie is running to the Rover to get the jack.  He is using his skip stride.  The crater in question is on the right side of AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18365" target="new" target="alsj">18365</a>.]
121:41:52|Jones|alsj|The rims of those small craters, if they were reasonably fresh, were usually soft.  Were there places where the bottoms of craters were soft, too?
121:41:52|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  (In) those small ones, you seemed to sink in a little bit more than on just the normal regolith.  And I don't know why that was - whether it was just more dust that had accumulated in there, you know, slumping down from the rim or whatever.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
121:42:17||alsj|Fendell pans left but, after getting a brief view of John, who is still aligning the Central Station antenna, all we see is a close-up of the right side of Charlie's suit.]</i></blockquote>
121:42:24||alsj|Charlie moves out of the way and we see John raise his left arm.
121:43:03||alsj|Charlie heads for the drill site with the jack.]</i></blockquote>
121:43:24||alsj|John starts toward the Lunar Surface Magnetometer (LSM) with the UHT but remembers that he hasn't disabled the shorting switch as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp055.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-23</a>, and returns to the Central Station.  With the shorting switch out, current from the RTG flowed through some resistance to mimic the load of the ALSEP experiments.  John will now depress the shorting switch with the tip of the UHT to divert the current to the experiments.] </i></blockquote>
121:43:32||alsj|At the left side of the TV picture, Charlie goes to his knees, possibly to remove the wrench from the drill stems before sliding the treadle - which has a hole in the middle - onto the stems.  He rises after a few seconds.  Figure 24 from Judy Allton's Apollo Tool Book shows the treadle being used during training.  Note that the suited figure in this photo has dark bands on his legs and, therefore, is a mission commander.  The photo was first published in an August 30, 1971 Martin-Marietta Report, MCR-71-35, &quot;Familiarization and Support Manual for Apollo Lunar Surface Drill&quot;.  The report was published less than a month after the end of Apollo 15 and the astronaut is either John, his backup Fred Haise, or the Apollo 17 Commander, Gene Cernan.]
121:43:32||alsj|On the treadle-and-jack, note the short, dark fulcrum just to the right of the core stem and, as well, the mechanism that grips the core stem.]</i></blockquote>
121:43:45||alsj|Fendell zooms in on John.
121:44:10||alsj|Houston is now getting a signal from the Central Station.]</i></blockquote>
121:44:18||alsj|Clearly, John is still disappointed about the loss of the Heat Flow Experiment.]</i></blockquote>
121:44:18||alsj|Fendell pans left to watch Charlie.  John goes to the LSM, picks it up, and carries it toward the west as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp055.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-22 and CDR-23</a>.]</i></blockquote>
121:45:11||alsj|It takes Charlie a while to get started but, once he gets the lifting mechanism seated, he gets a couple of inches (5 cm) per stroke.
121:45:49||alsj|Charlie has the treadle braced with his right foot and is getting about 30 degrees per stroke with his left hand.   It seems to be grabbing on pretty good.  He has his right hand on the core stem and, starting with the 17th stroke, he starts bending his knees on the downstroke and increases the depth of the stroke to 45 degrees.  On the 26th effective stroke - not counting some apparent false strokes - Charlie takes his foot off the treadle and drops all the way to his knees on the downstroke.  This increases the stroke depth to perhaps 60 or 70 degrees.]</i></blockquote>
121:46:53|Jones|alsj|I gather that, as you dropped down toward a kneeling position, the suit would pop you back up.
121:46:53|Duke|alsj|Yeah,  It would give you the leverage you needed to get almost down 90 degrees.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
121:46:54||alsj|Charlie's breathing is noticeable, but it is not at all labored.  Charlie takes a break after two of the deep strokes.  He flexes his left arm a few times and then resumes the deep strokes.  After the 33rd stroke, he takes another break.  We get a glimpse of the top of the core, which is now at about chest height.]
121:46:54|Jones|alsj|Is this particularly strenuous?
121:46:54|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  You see me take my left arm off of it every once in a while?  That's because I was cramping up a little bit in my arm.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
121:47:35||alsj|Charlie does two more deep strokes and then stops.  He puts his right foot on the treadle and, after flexing his left arm, grabs the core with both hands and tries to pull it out.  He doesn't get it to move very far and resumes the deep strokes.  In between strokes, he puts his right foot on the treadle, apparently steadying it while he gets the lifting mechanism to seat.]
121:47:35|Duke|tech|I'm glad we had the extractor (meaning the jack), because the extractor works great.  I had the same problem with it that I had in training.  Every time you pick it up to try to set the C-clamp (engaging mechanism) back down again, the bottom plate (meaning the treadle) would shift on you.  It wanted to walk clockwise with you.  What I did was put my right foot on the plate and jack with my left hand. That worked great.  It held steady then, and it speeded up the process.&quot;]
121:47:35||alsj|Tony calls after the 43rd stroke.
121:48:59||alsj|As he rests, Charlie is leaning forward and the top of the core is about level with the top of his helmet.  Making allowances for his posture, the top of the core is now about 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm) out of the ground - give or take a couple of inches.  My thanks to my Beautiful Australian Bride, Dianne Jones, who measured a conveniently-sized subject who mimicked Charlie's posture for her.]</i></blockquote>
121:49:04|Jones|alsj|Do you still agree with that statement.
121:49:04|Duke|alsj|Yeah, I agree with what I said.  I mean, I was cramped; but, over all, I didn't feel that tired.&quot;]
121:49:04||alsj|Fendell pans left to find John.  He has the LSM in place beyond the large rock noted earlier and has the three sensor arms deployed as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp055.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-24</a>. AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18388" target="new" target="alsj">18388</a> is similar to the TV view and the LSM is above the drill-stem rack which, in turn is to John's right (our left) in the picture.  To John's left, the drill, the HFE and the RTG are more or less in a line.  The Central Station is at the edge of the picture.]</i></blockquote>
121:50:23||alsj|While he waits for an answer, John goes off-camera to the right, probably to start the geophone deployment as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp057.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-26 and CDR-27</a>.]</i></blockquote>
121:50:39||alsj|Fendell pans right and finds John just as he reaches the Central Station.  He stops and picks up a piece of equipment and sets it upright near the RTG.  This is probably the thumper/geophone package.  In the foreground, Charlie has gotten the core out another half meter or so. He does a couple of final deep strokes and the core begins to tilt.  He pulls it out the last foot or so.]
121:50:39||alsj|In Houston, Tony's transmission gives Experiments second thoughts about what would be involved in moving the magnetometer.
121:51:07||alsj|Charlie has removed the treadle from the core and tosses it off-camera to the left. Its final resting place is shown in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18368" target="new" target="alsj">18368</a> where it can be seen beyond the left rim of the 5-meter crater but below the white ejecta blanket surrounding South Ray Crater in the distance.  Kenesaw is the hill on the horizon at the left side of the picture.]</i></blockquote>
121:51:23||alsj|Charlie was carrying the deep core over to the rack but stops and turns to look at the hole.
121:51:42||alsj|During this discussion, Charlie puts a cap on the bit end of the deep core.
121:51:57||alsj|Charlie turns to his left and knocks the rammer jammer off the rack.  John is in the background, back at the LSM.
121:52:10||alsj|Charlie rests the core on the rack.  The rammer-jammer is oriented east-west and Charlie goes around to the north side and positions himself to bob down to get it.  He is standing at an angle to the rammer-jammer, with his left side closer to it.  See the discussion following  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new" target="alsj">119:24:37</a>.] </i></blockquote>
121:52:22||alsj|Charlie puts his right leg forward and his left leg back and tries to get down, but his hand winds up about a foot short of the ground.  He bobs back up.  On his second try, he forces his left knee to the ground, gets his hand on the rammer-jammer and, in coming back up, springs completely off the ground, going forward.  He lands on both feet and does a little hop to his left to regain control;  he continues in that direction to go to the core hole.]</i></blockquote>
121:52:37||alsj|Fendell pans right to find Charlie.
121:52:46||alsj|While John heads toward the Central Station, Charlie gets the tip of the rammer-jammer into the core hole and feeds it in slowly.  Once the top of the rammer-jammer reaches waist height, Charlie releases his grip and all but the very top of the rammer-jammer disappears into the hole.
121:52:46|Duke|tech|It fell out of sight.  Only the top three inches of the rammer were visible.  It (meaning the hole) was perfectly open all the way down.&quot;]
121:52:46||alsj|Post-mission analysis indicates that only the bottom 6 cm of the 224 cm hole had filled, possibly with soil that eroded off the walls during core extraction.]</i></blockquote>
121:53:00||alsj|The Apollo 17 crew will place a neutron flux experiment in their core hole and, at the end of the mission, will recover the instrument for return to Earth.  Here, Houston is interested in seeing if the core hole has stayed open so that the 17 hole can be used for just such a purpose.
121:53:00||alsj|Charlie has noticed an intriguing rock near the rack.  He tries to bob down to get it with his left hand.  He misses the rock and nearly falls.  He scrambles to his left to regain his balance.
121:53:19||alsj|This time, Charlie goes down on both knees and falls forward onto his hands as he grabs the rock.  He then pushes back a little and tries to run under his center of gravity;  He doesn't make it and falls back on hands and knees.
121:53:33||alsj|Once he gets settled, Charlie gives a hard push back with his hands and, as his PLSS rotates over his knees, he stands without much difficulty.  This is the standard technique.  Once on his feet, Charlie examines the rock, turning it as he tries to find a clean surface.  Later, when he is near the TV camera at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.thumper.html#1222542" target="new" target="alsj">122:25:42</a>, Charlie shows the rock to Houston.]</i></blockquote>
121:53:56||alsj|This is a reference to an exchange between Charlie and Tony at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1200745" target="new" target="alsj">120:07:45</a> when Charlie tried to blow dust off a film magazine.  Blowing doesn't work very well when you're wearing a helmet.]
121:53:56||alsj|Charlie grabs the core and heads for the Rover.
121:54:13||alsj|Charlie will help John with the geophone deployment as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev117.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-17</a>.
||alsj|Brian McInall has created a planimetric map of the ALSEP deployment (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ALSEP-DeploymentPlanimetricMapLROC-M175179080LR_Jan2017.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10 Mb</a>).
||alsj|John is near the RTG and has his back to us. He is working with the geophone equipment. Charlie heads out to join John but, after skipping through the soft-rimmed crater north of the Rover, stops for a second to look at the soil he has disturbed. He then continues on his way. See Brian McInall's ALSEP Deployment Planimetric Map (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ALSEP-DeploymentPlanimetricMapLROC-M175179080LR_Jan2017.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10 Mb</a>).
121:54:46||alsj|White soil was found at various places by most of the crews and, here, it probably represents a layer of fine ejecta from South Ray Crater. The light color is due to the fact that the South Ray impact shocked the material near the impact point and created countless, highly reflective, angular fragments. In the time since the ejecta was laid down, micrometeorites have hit the top layer and each impact has produced a small puddle of brownish glass, gradually returning the top layer to the normal color.
121:54:46||alsj|Charlie goes east around the PSE to avoid getting dust on anything. John is putting the geophone anchor in the ground about eight feet north of the Central Station, as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp057.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-26 and CDR-27</a>. The anchor will ensure that, should John put any tension in the geophone cables, the Central Station will not move. In AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a>, the anchor is the object to the right of the Central Station with arrow-like fins.]</i></blockquote>
121:55:12||alsj|Charlie was supposed to bring a camera out from the Rover. Neither of them is wearing a camera for the simple reason that the cameras protrude out nearly a foot and would get in the way during the instrument deployment and drilling. Here, Charlie needs a camera to document the deployment of the geophone line.
121:55:12||alsj|John may be looping the geophone cables around the bottom of the anchor.
121:55:19||alsj|John sticks the tip of the anchor in the ground and Charlie moves in to push it in.
121:55:20||alsj|Charlie jumps up enough that he can scoot his feet behind him and put his full weight on the anchor. It sinks a foot or so into the ground.
121:55:25||alsj|As Charlie gets up, his heels nudge the mortar cables which are strung out behind him.
121:56:10||alsj|Charlie is referring to the penetrometer experiment, a long rod with interchangeable conical tips. When using the penetrometer, he pushes the instrument into the soil and a built-in sensor measures the penetration depth and the force used. Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-1</a> from the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> shows the penetrometer and attachments. The three cones in the figure have base areas - perpendicular to the penetration axis - of 1.29, 3.22 and 6.44 square centimeters. According to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, only the two smaller cones were flown and Charlie's 'two-tenths' refers to the 1.29-square-centimeter cone and 'five tenths' refers to the 3.22. Journal Contributor Keith Hearn notes that 1.29 cm<sup>2</sup> = 0.2 in<sup>2</sup> and  3.22 cm<sup>2</sup> = 0.5 in<sup>2</sup>. Station 10 is a stop planned at the end of EVA-2 when John and Charlie are almost back to the LM. EVA-2 cuff checklist pages LMP-18 and LMP-19 show the penetrometer activities planned for Station 10.
121:56:10|Duke|alsj|They had three or four sizes of cones for the head of the thing. The smallest was that 'two' and my fear was that, if I put that on, it was going to go into the ground all the way - (maximum penetration possible is 76 cm) - and not give us a good reading. In fact, later on here (during EVA-2), you'll see one time I did push on one and it did go all the way in and I fell down.
121:56:10|Jones|alsj|Had you already done enough pushing of the geophone stake and the penetrometer to get a feel for that?
121:56:10||alsj|I was thinking about training, but didn't ask the question well. Charlie thought I was asking about his EVA activities up to this point.
121:56:10|Duke|alsj|Yeah, apparently. Not the penetrometer - we hadn't used that yet - but the geophone stakes and the other things we were pushing in. You know, the heat flow (drill stem), the first one; I could push it in three or four centimeters. It just felt soft to me.
121:56:15||alsj|John has picked up the thumper assembly. Apparently, Charlie has gotten close enough to the geophone cable to concern John.
121:56:16||alsj|John and Charlie are working with the thumper assembly, releasing the first of three geophones which Charlie will plant in the ground near the Central Station as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev117.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-17</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp057.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-26, and CDR-27</a>.
121:56:50||alsj|Charlie has taken the geophone from John.
121:57:02||alsj|The conical geophone is attached to the cable and, holding the cable in both hands, Charlie lowers the geophone to the ground, point first. He then steps on the top of the geophone, apparently pushing it straight in.
121:57:13||alsj|This is some kind of training reference, perhaps to an early deployment system.
121:57:24||alsj|John is positioning himself so that he can walk west, away from the anchor, with the cable reel outside his right hand.
121:57:30||alsj|John has the hammer in a pocket on his right shin and wants to know if Charlie will need to use it to emplace a stake at the second geophone site.
121:57:41||alsj|This is a second anchor that they will use to secure the cable after they deploy the second geophone 150 feet from the first.
121:57:41||alsj|John starts walking west along the Rover tracks. He move slowly and deliberately to avoid jerking the cable.
121:57:47||alsj|As John noted at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1195806" target="new" target="alsj">119:58:06</a>, the UV camera emits an incidental VHF radio signal when it re-modes. John and Charlie's OPS antennas pick up that signal and, consequently, they can hear the camera in operation.
121:57:51||alsj|Charlie was watching John but turns to look at the first geophone.
121:58:02||alsj|Charlie starts for the Rover. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom and then pans left to follow John.
121:58:15||alsj|Charlie runs to catch up with John, this time using a loping, foot-to-foot stride.
121:58:48||alsj|Charlie switches to his sideways skip, leading with his left foot.
121:59:12||alsj|John is walking slowly, but not that slowly. In one 45-second interval, he takes about 40 steps. He is walking, flat-footed, with a wide stance, and covers about 15 meters in that interval.
121:59:24||alsj|They have gone over a small ridge and John's feet are no longer visible.
121:59:46||alsj|This may be a warning mark on the cable that tells them they are nearly 150 feet (45 meters) from the anchor. The cable section containing the second geophone is about to come off the reel.
121:59:47||alsj|Charlie runs around John's left side, goes in front and ends up on John's right so that he can free the geophone. John and Charlie are now far enough down the far side of the ridge that we can no longer see their knees.
122:00:03||alsj|John stops. It took him about 130 seconds to walk 45 meters and his average speed was about 1.2 km/hour. For comparison, typical running speeds achieved by the astronauts when they are unencumbered are 5 to 6 km/hour.
122:00:16||alsj|John frees the second geophone and Charlie lowers it to the ground.
122:00:29||alsj|Although we can't see exactly what is going on, Charlie is probably having trouble keeping the geophone vertical.
122:00:49||alsj|Just before Charlie's next transmissions, his upper body movements indicate that he finally steps on the geophone and gets it planted.
122:01:01||alsj|Charlie is positioning the second anchor.
122:01:08||alsj|Once again, Charlie jumps up to get his feet back and pushes the anchor a foot or more into the ground.
122:01:20||alsj|John may be referring to fins like those on the top of the first anchor. Their primary purpose may be to make the anchor easily visible in documentary photographs. See AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a>.] </i></blockquote>
122:01:25||alsj|John positions himself to resume the cable deployment.
122:01:26||alsj|Charlie frees the snag he noticed.
122:01:48||alsj|Charlie heads for the Rover. He is off-camera most of the time but, during two brief glimpses we get of him, he is using the foot-to-foot, loping stride.
122:01:48|Duke|alsj|If I wasn't carrying anything and it was fairly level, I'd just usually run normally.
122:02:14||alsj|During training, John and Charlie could not have worn or used functional PLSSs. The real PLSSs were far to heavy and, as well, the cooling system would only operate in a vacuum. Instead, they wore lightweight PLSS mock-ups and got oxygen and cooling water through hoses which were handled by support personnel who followed them around to keep the hoses out of the way.  Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#72H100" target="new" target="alsj">72-H-100h</a> shows the air compressors and tanks.
122:02:14|Jones|alsj|I take it that this is a training reference.
122:02:14|Duke|alsj|We had the cooling water guy and one with an oxygen hose and they just followed us around. They had different lengths of hoses so that they could get farther away from us.
122:02:14||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-KSC-72PC-141.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-72PC-141</a> shows John Young (left) on 31 March 1972 as he prepares to collect a sample with the Contact Soil Sampler, a task discussed at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta9.html#1475647" target="new" target="alsj">147:56:47</a>. The tech on the left side of the picture is holding John's cooling water hose (black). Behind John, we can see the shadow of another tech handling John's air hose and comm cable. Charlie's three cables/hoses go out the picture to the right.
122:02:14||alsj|After a while, all we see is the top of John's PLSS.
122:02:14|Jones|alsj|That's really a deep hole!
122:02:14|Duke|alsj|Yeah; it's a big ridge. We're sort of up on a ridge and it's going down. You really can't tell it, just looking out can you?
122:02:14|Jones|alsj|Those little rocks on the edge of it help a little bit.
122:02:52||alsj|The distance from the second geophone to the Rover is about 70 meters and, although we don't actually see Charlie arrive at the back of the Rover, we get glimpses of his shadow which suggest that the trip took no more than 1 minute 10 seconds. His running speed, therefore, was about 3.6 km/hr. By Apollo standards, this is a leisurely pace; but, of course, it is still early in the first EVA. Charlie's efficiency will improve.
122:02:52||alsj|The TV picture shakes as Charlie works around the Rover. As we will hear in a moment, he has found the locking pin from John's purge valve on the ground next to the Commander's seat. The amplitude of the TV motions suggest that he may be leaning on the Rover as he goes down to get the pin. Fendell pans right and stops when the Central Station is in view. One end of the deep core is visible at the right side of the picture. It is lying across the back of the Rover, secured in the vise on the top of the geopallet.
122:04:11||alsj|Charlie stops briefly to make sure that he had, indeed, put cap Bravo on the bit end of the deep core.
122:04:23||alsj|The next four minutes of video is missing from the tape Ken Glover is currently using to create RealVideo files for the ALSJ.
122:04:56|Jones|alsj|If you need to open the purge valve and you pull the pin, do you then actually do something mechanically to the valve to get it flowing?
122:04:56|Duke|alsj|Yeah. And I'm not sure exactly what you had to do. I think you had to twist it one way or the other.
122:04:56|Jones|alsj|So the chances of starting to lose oxygen out of the suit if the pin fell out were (slight)...
122:04:56|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh. The pin was just a safety, like most all pins. You pulled the pin out and then you had to make an action of turning it or pulling it - I've forgotten. You had to take a distinct action; but I suppose there was a possibility of brushing up against something and you could twist it or pop it and you could start flowing (oxygen) out. Your suit would make it up, but you'd be using quantity out real fast and it would shorten the EVA. So I asked John to check his EMU and make sure the purge valve wasn't popped open and he wasn't losing O2.
122:04:56|Jones|alsj|Because you found the pin next to his seat, I suppose it probably came out when he was getting on or off the Rover.
122:04:56|Duke|alsj|Apparently so. It might have hung up on the seatbelt, probably.
122:04:56||alsj|See the dialog at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1222634" target="new" target="alsj">122:26:34</a>.
122:04:56|Jones|alsj|And your first thought, when you found it, was to have him check (his pressure gauge and oxygen quantity)...
122:04:56|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh. Make sure his quantity's okay.
122:04:56||alsj|Charlie covers the 30 meters between the Rover and the Central Station in about 30 seconds. Once again, his average speed is about 3.6 km/hour.
122:04:59||alsj|Charlie is asking John if he has reached the end of the geophone line.
122:05:00||alsj|John is probably planting the third geophone and an associated flag, as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp057.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-27</a>.
122:05:40|Young|tech|I'd say it was within 1 foot in 100 meters of being straight down that line.
122:05:40||alsj|Charlie's first ALSEP photo is AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18345" target="new" target="alsj">18345</a>, taken straight down the geophone line. John is visible from about the chest up just to the left of the central fiducial. The objects in the foreground are discarded pieces of ALSEP packaging material. Post-mission analysis indicates that the geophone line lies on a heading of 287 degrees. The nearest of the Rover tracks that John laid down when he first arrived at the ALSEP site are about 3 meters (10 feet) north of the geophone line.]</i></blockquote>
122:05:47||alsj|Houston loses the TV signal because of a transmission problem from the receiving station near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid</a>. TV coverage resumes at about 122:09.
122:06:20||alsj|Twenty-one small charges - single-bridgewire, Apollo standard initiators - are mounted in the base plate of the thumper. John will fire these charges at 15-foot (4.57 m) intervals along the geophone line to generate seismic signals. The pattern of arrivals at the three geophones will give investigators information related to the depth and velocity structure of layers in the regolith. Figure 10-1 from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> shows the preliminary results of the experiment. Vp is compressive velocity, the sound speed of acoustic waves in soil. The Apollo standard initiators were used for such purposes as opening valves and severing connections between spacecraft stages.
122:06:32||alsj|At some point, Charlie takes AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18346" target="new" target="alsj">18346</a> of the PSE. As he has told Houston, there is a sprinkling of dust on the north side. At about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1220850" target="new" target="alsj">122:08:50</a>, he backs up and takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a>, which shows the rock between the PSE and the Central Station, the RTG beyond and to the left of the Central Station, and the geophone cable anchor to the right.]</i></blockquote>
122:07:45||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp059.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-28</a>, the experimenters need to have John and Charlie stand still for ten seconds before John fires each shot. This prevents confusion of the thumper signal with signals generated by footfalls. John places the thumper firmly on the ground and, after ten seconds of quiet, selects the next initiator - in this case, the first one - rotates the arm switch, counts four seconds, and depresses the fire switch.
122:07:48||alsj|As we can see after the TV resumes, the thumper jumps in reaction to the charge detonation and kicks up a small cloud of dust. On Apollo 14, equipment problems produced a number of misfires but, thanks to equipment modifications for Apollo 16, John will not have any appreciable difficulties.
122:07:48|Jones|alsj|Did John fire the thumper in the training exercises?
122:07:48|Duke|alsj|The training model didn't fire; I mean, they didn't load it up. I believe he fired the flight one - or maybe the backup flight one - once. He actually fired the thing. And, of course, this time he's firing it. He could feel it. It'd hit and it would splash out a little dust on the side. I could look down and see that; but I couldn't feel it in my feet.
122:07:48||alsj|Readers should note that the Thumper/Geophone experiment was previously flown on Apollo 14 and was used successfully by Ed Mitchell.  The accompanying <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-thumptrain.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">picture</a> shows John training with the thumper at the Cape on 22 December 1971.  Charlie is in shirt sleeves at the right side of the image.
122:07:48||alsj|John and Charlie stand still for an additional ten seconds and then John moves forward 15 feet, toward the Central Station, for the next shot. Readers should note that, by now, John seems to have completely regained his composure and confidence.
122:08:10||alsj|John has had a misfire but, on the second try, is successful. In a number of cases, Mitchell tried repeatedly to fire particular charges without success. Post-mission analysis indicated that John had a misfire because his 5-second count between arming and firing was a little too fast.
122:08:53||alsj|TV coverage resumes. After taking AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18347" target="new" target="alsj">18347</a>, Charlie positions himself south of the Central Station.]</i></blockquote>
122:09:28||alsj|Charlie hops three steps to his left and takes AS16-113-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18348" target="new" target="alsj">18348</a>, which shows the back of the Central Station and, coiled up on the ground, the severed heat flow cable.    At the lower right, note the bright, orange-colored patch of sunlight reflected off the Central Station's Mylar curtain. 
122:09:28|Duke|alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18348" target="new" target="alsj">18348</a> is looking to the north. Smoky Mountain's in the background, in the upper center of the picture. There's a big boulder in the near background. This is a picture of the Central Station and you can see the spaghetti. The cable off to the left goes to the RTG. It was more of a round cable. But the flat cables that go to the various experiments, you can see, were coiled up like spaghetti on the lunar surface. That was what we had complained about before the mission - that we might have a problem with those things - because we saw that, occasionally, in the one-sixth-gravity training in the airplane.
122:09:28||alsj|&quot;We didn't see it out on the training site in one g; the stuff was used so much in training that it didn't have a set in it like these cables. You know, these things had never been unwound before and had just set in its coil. And so, when you tried to undo 'em, they just tended to curl up.&quot;
122:09:28|Jones|alsj|The stuff you used in training, could you coil it up and then put it out and it would...
122:09:28|Duke|alsj|It would lay flat. So John could just step over it. But, up on the Moon, you tended to shuffle. In one-sixth gravity, you tended to shuffle more than you did down on the Earth. In training, the suits were sort of lumbery, so you just sort of stepped and you had real definite steps; but up on the Moon, you tended to shuffle a lot. You didn't get your feet up in the air as much; and that's why John got all tangled up and, unfortunately, ripped off the heat flow. You can see one of the connectors here. In fact, just to the right of the RTG connector is where the heat flow cable had been connected.
122:10:04||alsj|Charlie moves in to the Central Station, probably to take a look at the heat flow cable. This is what is on Houston's mind, too.
122:10:10||alsj|Charlie drops to his knees so that he can pick up the end of the cable.
122:10:10|Jones|alsj|When you grabbed the cable, did you take the connector off the Central Station?
122:10:10|Duke|alsj|No. The connector was sort of locked on. It was latched on pre-flight and, as far as I know, we couldn't get it off without a screwdriver or a pair of pliers or something to get it unlocked. So I just looked at it and I saw that it had broken off right flush with the connector. The connector was a wide connector and that flat wire just sort of slipped in. And the connector was clamped on both sides and how...
122:10:10||alsj|&quot;We could have probably fixed it, but we would've had to have taken the connector off. We would've had to pick up all the electronics and the heat flow probes and everything and haul all that back into the Lunar Module. And getting all that folded up...We probably could have stuffed into the ETB or something like that; but they decided that it was going to take us too long. They decided that you could scrape and get an abrasive surface to get a better contact and we could stick it in there. (Backup Commander) Fred Haise demonstrated it, and we probably could have done it; but it was too long (a job), so they decided just to abandon ship.&quot;
122:10:10|Jones|alsj|So Fred and others had tried to work the problem?
122:10:10|Duke|alsj|Yeah. They were our backup; and, when you had problems like that everybody in mission control got to work, especially the people that were interested in this. So they'd corral the backup crew and the engineers and the Principle Investigator and the Bendix folks - who made this ALSEP - and see if they could work out a procedure to fix it. And they probably developed something. They never did radio it up to us because they decide it was going to take too long.
122:10:10|Jones|alsj|Rather like what you did for the 17 crew when their fender came off.
122:10:10|Duke|alsj|Right.
122:10:26||alsj|Because he is so close to the Central Station, Charlie can't get down on his hands and then push back to get up. He will have to lean back just enough to get his center of gravity over his feet and then get to his feet without kicking dirt all over the Central Station.
122:10:31||alsj|With the heat flow cable in his right hand, Charlie leans back but doesn't get back far enough that he can make the attempt to get up. He leans forward slightly to try again.
122:10:36||alsj|Charlie leans back again, jumps up and then hops back to get his balance. It is a well-executed maneuver.
122:11:01||alsj|Charlie lifts the end of the cable so that he can describe it to Houston.
122:11:54||alsj|As indicated in Figure 14-51, the break occurred at a line of solder joints. &quot;Pull tests performed on the cable/Astromate connector configuration indicated the strength at the cable/board interface was 31 pounds. A modified joint assembly (Figure 14-52) which provides strain relief and has a pull strength of over 100 pounds will be used for the heat flow experiment connector and (other) similar connectors on Apollo 17.&quot;
122:11:54||alsj|Charlie tosses the end of the cable to the ground at the base of the Central Station.
122:12:29||alsj|Charlie turns to face down-Sun so he can start a pan.
122:12:38||alsj|Charlie taps the top of his camera, probably to remove dust.
122:13:07||alsj|Charlie bends his knees and pulls his head and shoulder back to raise his aim. He starts his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#a16pan1221232" target="new" target="alsj">ALSEP pan</a>  with a down-Sun picture, AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18349" target="new" target="alsj">18349</a>, which shows the magnetometer. Prior to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1221316" target="new" target="alsj">122:13:16</a>, he takes eight or nine more pictures, turning slightly to his right between frames.]
122:13:07|Duke|alsj|On  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18349" target="new" target="alsj">18349</a>, you can see how, if you look down-Sun, it's very bright. And zero-phase it just washes out completely and you can't even see the details in the surface. But, just away from that, you can begin to see the rocks and the footprints and stuff like that that were on the surface. Good view of the sort of the slope of the terrain on the horizon. It looks likes it's sloping down from north to south. And that was a little more pronounced than we had expected.&quot;]

122:13:07||alsj|The RTG is also visible in  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18352" target="new" target="alsj">18352</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18353" target="new" target="alsj">18353</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18354" target="new" target="alsj">18354</a>.]

122:13:07|Jones|alsj|In training did you take pans and develop the film to see how you did?
122:13:07|Duke|alsj|We practiced all the photographic sequences that we had. Every time we put out the ALSEP in training, we would go through not only the experiments deployment but we'd go through the photo layout and sequence so we knew what to do and it was second nature.
122:13:07|Jones|alsj|Did you have film in the camera.
122:13:07|Duke|alsj|Yeah. Uh-huh. And then they would develop it and we would look at it to see how we screwed up and if we were in focus and make sure the horizon was right. And that gave us a good idea of just how much we had to lean back and how to point the camera. It was a single-reflex lens and you just sort of had to, you know, point right and try to get it. What you thought was right. And it turned out pretty good. We tried to get it so that we had just a little horizon. We didn't want to get too high and get, you know, this black sky. And that took some practice but, by the time we got going, we were okay.
122:13:31||alsj|Charlie resumes the pan just before his next transmission. He stops before he faces the TV camera.
122:13:31||alsj|Frame AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18358" target="new" target="alsj">18358</a> shows the LM at the left side of the frame.]

In the foreground, we see the PSE, The mortar pack is at left center.  At the lower left, note the bright, orange-colored patch of sunlight reflected off the Central Station's Mylar curtain.  The Central Station is out of the field-of-view to the left.
122:13:31|Duke|alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18359" target="new" target="alsj">18359</a> is part of the pan and, in the near field, you can see the Passive Seismic, to the left, in the middle foreground, is the mortar package. It's just sitting out there, waiting for John to get the plate in place. And, of course, you're looking more to the east now, back at the Rover (means 'LM'). You can see the little rise we had to walk up. Really, we're almost eye-level with the Ascent Stage. Looking back to the edge of the valley to the east, you're looking at the shadowed side of the rock and the soil, so it's a darker gray.&quot;]
122:13:31|Jones|alsj|And this is the rock we've been looking at over near the Central Station.
122:13:31|Duke|alsj|Right. That's actually the rock, I think, that John leaned on to pick up the cable he broke.
122:13:31||alsj|Charlie continues turning to his right as he takes AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18360" target="new" target="alsj">18360</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18361" target="new" target="alsj">18361</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18362" target="new" target="alsj">18362</a>.

Charlie almost certainly resumed his pan once he knew John was moving to the next thumper location.

122:14:34|Duke|alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18365" target="new" target="alsj">18365</a> is looking in toward the Central Station, where I took the pan, and shows the drill sitting on the near foreground, a lot of the footprints, and then you can see Stone Mountain in the background. Cincos is just off to the right.&quot;]
122:14:34|Jones|alsj|There's some nice, deep footprints on the rim of that crater you were talking about. Just over the drill.
122:14:34|Duke|alsj|I remarked about that; it was real soft in that area. And you can see the Rover in the background. And it was parked basically facing south. I think 195 degrees was the heading and the (TV) camera's looking at us taking a picture. To me, the ground looks like what I call 'freshly plowed' and it just looked like it had been rained on. You can see where the unspoiled surface was. And you see, when you step on it, it makes it a brighter albedo. Why that is, I don't know. The surface was fairly unconsolidated in this area. Later on, when we looked at the core, it had, you know, various sizes of grains; but it was all mostly fines. As you stepped on it, you never sank in more than an inch or two in this area. You can see the footprints.

You could see, off in the distance, right below the horizon, is South Ray Crater. It's the lighter area. Most of the surface around here is undisturbed. I had drilled one hole in; and that's on the right.&quot;]
122:14:34||alsj|Fendell pans left to watch John. He overshoots him but reverses direction to get him centered.
122:14:50||alsj|The 'white thing' may be one of a series of markers attached to the cable at 15-foot intervals to show John where to do the shots.
122:15:16||alsj|John places the thumper plate on the ground.
122:15:20||alsj|Charlie may have just taken AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18371" target="new" target="alsj">18371</a>, a close-up of the RTG from the south.]
122:15:20|Jones|alsj|This cable coming off the RTG is sitting well up off the ground and one can see the waves and wiggles even in these ribbon cables.
122:15:20|Duke|alsj|And you can see it was real dusty around here. The footprints are some of the deeper ones that we had on the lunar surface. The ALSEP site was sort of on a crown - which, generally, makes it less dusty; but, in this place, it was real dusty. You can see John has kicked up some dust on the base of the RTG. It hadn't gotten on the fins or anything, so it didn't bother it as far as its performance.
122:15:57||alsj|As Fendell follows John, Charlie comes into view. He is on the northeast corner of the magnetometer, trying to release the sunshade as per the instruction printed on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev118.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-18</a> under the symbol for the 3-foot close-up of the magnetometer.
122:15:57||alsj|Because of the skipped location, the distance between shots 11 and 12 is 30 feet (9 meters).
122:16:17||alsj|Charlie appears to be pulling a lanyard to deploy the sunshade and the southwest arm moves inward in response. AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18372" target="new" target="alsj">18372</a> is Charlie's close-up, which has probably been taken by now. The sunshade is the roll of gold-foil material on a string suspended between the SW and NW arms.]
122:16:17||alsj|John walks forward to the top of the ridge and positions himself for the next shot.
122:16:49||alsj|Now that John is out of the depression, we see the spray of dust kicked up by the thumper.
122:17:14||alsj|After standing motionless for ten seconds, John moves forward for the next shot and Charlie goes around to the southwest arm and pushes it down.
122:18:10||alsj|After the thumper fires, John forgets to remain motionless and starts forward after only a couple of seconds.
122:18:10||alsj|Charlie steps between the SW and NW arms and reaches in carefully to take hold of the sunshield.
122:18:41||alsj|This time, John remembers to stand still. Just before Tony's next transmission, Charlie frees the sunshade.
122:18:41||alsj|John runs forward to the next location. He covers the 4.5 m distance in 8 strides.
122:19:14||alsj|Charlie moves away from the LSM and gets settled for the next shot.
122:19:19||alsj|John moves forward and Fendell follows him.
122:20:08||alsj|John moves forward.
122:20:37||alsj|The concern may be that reflections off the trash might create thermal problems for the experiments.
122:20:58||alsj|John now moves forward 9 meters to do the last shot next to the geophone they deployed near the Central Station.
122:21:05||alsj|John reaches the final thumper location. He is about 3 meters west of the anchor.
122:21:41||alsj|At about this time, Charlie takes two up-Suns of the magnetometer, AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18373" target="new" target="alsj">18373</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18374" target="new" target="alsj">18374</a>. Both show the deployed the magnetometer sunshade. The RTG and the Central Station are in the background. John is near the Central Station firing shot 19.]</i></blockquote>

The pre-arrival noise at the left side of the figure is not indicative of the true noise level because it includes residuals from prior shots and the crew's movements between shots. By having John and Charlie stay motionless for about 25 seconds after the last shot, the experimenters get a better idea of the true noise level.
122:22:28||alsj|John moves a few steps to the northwest and uses a sidearm motion to toss the thumper off to the north. Charlie comes into view.
122:22:48||alsj|John has moved northeast of the Central Station and throws a piece of trash off to the north. Charlie takes a picture across the top of the Central Station from the north. This is AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18375" target="new" target="alsj">18375</a>. Stone Mountain is in the background.]</i></blockquote>
122:23:02||alsj|Charlie takes a moment to go through his checklist. John waits for him to get out of the way.
122:23:33||alsj|Charlie has taken the camera off his RCU bracket and sets it down on top of the Central Station for John's use. John moves in and gets a UHT. He moves away from the Central Station, looks at his checklist, and turns pages until he gets to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp059.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-28</a>.
122:23:41||alsj|The 'hockey stick' is the locking pin that fell out of John's purge valve. Charlie stowed it under John's seat after he found it on the ground next to the Rover.
122:23:47||alsj|John goes around to the south side of the Central Station, stepping carefully over cables as he goes. He is making sure that the mortar package can't get a signal from the Central Station and fire a mortar while he is working around it.
122:24:02||alsj|Charlie uses the foot-to-foot, loping stride until he gets to the soft-rimmed crater and then switches to his skipping stride.
122:24:08||alsj|John turns the mortar package switch and then uses the UHT to clear some debris from around the Central Station.
122:24:24||alsj|It takes Charlie about 42 seconds to cover the 35 meters between the Central Station and the Rover.
122:24:36||alsj|Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-3a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3a</a> from the Mission Report shows John's heart rate and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-3b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3b</a> shows Charlie's. John's is the lowest it has been since he got off the Rover at the ALSEP site. Charlie has also just come through a minimum, and in both cases they have both gotten quite a bit of rest, standing still while John did the series of thumper shots. If Charlie had a brief period of 110 beats per minute due to the run back to the Rover, it doesn't show up in the plot, probably because the plotted points represent averages over intervals of a few minutes.
122:24:36||alsj|John is north of the Central Station, flipping more debris out of the way. Charlie holds something in front of the TV camera; but I, at least, couldn't make it out. It probably would have been better if Charlie had held the object a bit farther away from the camera.
122:24:44||alsj|As Tony indicates at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1222523" target="new" target="alsj">122:25:23</a>, he sees what he thinks is the so-called 'red apple' which the astronauts would use to open the purge valve. I was expecting to see the locking pin.
122:24:54||alsj|John heads for the mortar package carrying the UHT.
122:25:04||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and we see John going past the Central Station to get a piece of equipment.
122:25:37||alsj|We get a glimpse of Charlie's shadow as he heads for the Central Station.
122:25:42||alsj|In looking at the video again, I finally picked out the glass sphere. It is about two to three centimeters across. Charlie held it between his thumb and forefinger and it is very difficult to see against the dark background of his very dirty fingers. Charlie collected the glass sphere at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.deepcore.html#1215310" target="new" target="alsj">121:53:10</a> just after he dropped the rammer-jammer down the core hole. According to the </i>Apollo 16 Voice Transcript Pertaining to the geology of the landing site<i> by N.G. Bailey and G.E. Ulrich, this is sample 60095, which weighs 46.6 grams. The glass sphere is shown is NASA photo S72-39426. It arrived in Houston more or less in the condition Charlie described and was probably created in the South Ray impact.
122:25:42||alsj|John has picked up the base he will put under the Mortar package. Charlie joins him.
122:26:17||alsj|John has backed away from the mortar cable. Charlie bends his right knee and leans to his right to get at John's purge valve. He then puts his left foot back and sinks down onto his right knee to get a little lower. John bends his knees and pulls his head and shoulders back to raise the purge valve.
122:26:23||alsj|Charlie is now down on both knees.
122:26:33||alsj|Charlie rises without difficulty, possibly keeping himself steady by taking John's hidden right hand or by grabbing part of his suit.
122:26:38||alsj|Charlie turns to head back to the Rover. Once he has a little forward momentum, he springs up off both feet and does an elegant kangaroo-hop over the cables, clearing them easily.
122:26:38||alsj|John's 'red-apple', which is on the end of the lanyard for his purge valve pin, can be seen in a frame capture ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelt2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">162k</a> )  from 16-mm film of the LM/LRV checkout on 4 April l972.
122:26:48||alsj|Post-mission analysis of photographs indicates that the maximum depth of the Rover tracks is about 5 cm. The deepest penetration, of course, was seen in the rims of small, relatively fresh craters. The average track depth was 1.25 cm. Based on lab tests done with crushed-basalt lunar-soil simulants, the track depths indicate a typical porosity of 41 percent.
122:27:25||alsj|John has attached the mortar base to his UHT and carries it over to the geophone anchor. As per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp059.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-28</a>, he will align it with the geophone line and read off a sun angle which he will then use to properly align the base under the mortar package. Photo AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18380" target="new" target="alsj">18380</a> is a close-up of the deployed mortar package and base. At the present moment, John has the UHT fitted into the hole at the center of the compass pattern on the base and the UHT shadow gives him the proper alignment. The UHT will, of course, serve as a gnomon during the deployment as well.]</i></blockquote>
122:27:56||alsj|The western half of the geophone line was on the other side of the ridge and John is proud of the straight-line deployment he achieved. He mentions the fact again during the post-mission Technical Debrief.
122:28:24||alsj|John's difficulties in picking the right word are legendary. Readers may want to consult the discussion he had with the Apollo 17 crew during their EVA-2 Preps. During the rest period between EVA-1 and EVA-2, John had tested a design for a makeshift replacement fender for their Rover and had some difficulty describing the procedures. This is all part of the John Young 'Country Boy' demeanor which masks a superb intellect.
122:28:24||alsj|John turns and walks toward the mortar package. In the foreground, we see the core stem move as Charlie tries to break the core between the second and third sections.
122:28:24||alsj|John puts the base down and goes to his knees so he can grab the mortar package in his left hand. He has the UHT to help with his balance and rises easily.
122:29:04||alsj|John has backed off-camera to the right, fully deploying the mortar cable. Fendell follows and, in the foreground, we see Charlie rotate the bottom two core sections so he can look at the top of the second one.
122:29:08||alsj|John gets to the end of the mortar cable and then moves back in a meter or two and somewhat to the west, possibly to find a level spot. He puts the base down and then sinks to his knees. He puts the mortar package down and then stands, picks up the base and knocks some dust off with his free left hand.
122:29:36||alsj|Baker is the cap on the bit end of the first (deepest) core section; and Delta is the cap on the top of the second section.
122:30:25||alsj|John is still working with the mortar base. Charlie comes around to the LMP seat.
122:30:51||alsj|Charlie takes the capped core stem sections to the rack. John is still working with the mortar base.
122:31:08||alsj|John is referring to one of the anchoring stakes shown in the sketch in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-65</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission Report.
122:31:35||alsj|Charlie returns to the Rover and goes around the back to work at John's seat as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev120.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-20</a>.
122:31:35||alsj|In Houston, Flight Director Pete Frank is told that there will be a meeting after the ALSEP deployment to see what might be done about the severed Heat Flow cable.
122:32:44||alsj|Charlie will put sample bag dispensers and film magazines on John's Hasselblad. Charlie's camera is still on top of the Central Station.
122:32:57||alsj|John has mis-spoken. There are actually four legs.
122:32:57||alsj|Charlie goes around the front of the Rover to work at the LMP seat and blocks our view of John.
122:33:32||alsj|Charlie goes out of view around the back of the Rover.
122:34:35||alsj|John takes hold of the UHT and holds the mortar base just off the ground as he gets it aligned.
122:34:44||alsj|John presses the anchor stakes into the ground. Charlie comes around to the LMP seat and we get a close-up view as he turns his checklist pages. He is looking at prior pages to make sure he has done everything.
122:34:44|Jones|alsj|It seemed like you just pulled a page up with a finger and then brushed it across.
122:34:44|Duke|alsj|That's the way we turned it. It was more of a brush. The pages were real stiff and they'd would begin to curl up and then they'd flip over - on the spring. There was a spring they were around - or a wire, a coiled wire. It was sort of like a spring - like a spiral notebook, really.
122:34:44|Jones|alsj|But bent back over the shape of your wrist to hold it open.
122:34:44||alsj|A detail from Apollo 13 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../cuffcheckbind.jpg" title="image"  target="new" target="alsj">70-HC-83</a> is a good side view of Jim Lovell's cuff checklist.
122:34:44||alsj|Once Charlie moves out of the way, we see that John has disengaged the UHT and, apparently, is using it to press the southwest corner down. He is trying to get it level. The first few times, it rocks in response to his efforts. Eventually, it doesn't move enough to show in the TV picture. Every once in a while, he puts the UHT back at the center to create a shadow and check the alignment.
122:36:43||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf10-3.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, mortar No. 1 will be fired a distance of 1500 m and, at that distance, the 3-degree pointing error will result in an impact about 80 degrees off line to the north. This will necessitate a small adjustment in post-mission data analysis but will not have any significant affect on the value of the results.
122:36:43||alsj|John sticks his left leg out behind him, leans to his right, and grabs the mortar pack. He then moves to the east side of the mortar base, sticks his left leg out to the side and slightly to the front and then bends his right knee as he carefully places the mortar pack on the base.
122:37:28||alsj|Samples are documented with photographs taken before collection and additional photographs taken after collection. These show exactly what rock was collected and what its situation was on the pristine surface. Often, the &quot;before&quot; photos include a &quot;cross-Sun&quot; stereopair taken from either the north or south, and a &quot;down-Sun&quot; taken from the east.
122:37:28||alsj|Charlie is using John's camera with Apollo 16 magazine 114/B and takes a stereopair, AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18383" target="new" target="alsj">18383</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18384" target="new" target="alsj">18384</a>, stepping to his right between frames. As is also indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, he is sampling in a small crater near the front of the Rover The sample is 60035, a 1.053 kilogram brecciated anorthosite.]
122:37:28||alsj|John has moved around to the north side of the mortar pack. He turns the UHT around so that he is holding the tip, puts the handle on the ground and uses it as a support as he kneels. He has been careful to avoid fouling the tip. He adjusts the leveling and alignment with his left hand.
122:37:28||alsj|In terrestrial gravity, kneeling was relatively easy because the astronaut's body weight was high enough to overcome the pressurized suit's resistance to bending, as evidenced by a pre-flight <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.cdkneels.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photo</a> showing Charlie kneeling during a suit fitting session. On the Moon, his total weight - including his backpack - wasn't enough to overcome the suit's resistance to kneeling. For some reason, John and Gene Cernan were better able to bend their knees and stay down in a kneeling position.
122:37:28|Duke|alsj|You could go down on a knee but, to keep your balance, you really needed like a three-point suspension - like a football lineman - so he's using a Universal Tool there to balance himself while he's working with his left hand. And I used the shovel a lot to bend down on - and the other equipment we had, like the rakes and stuff like that, too. Or, you could lean against the Rover or lean against a rock to get your sample if you had to bend over. When you leaned on something in a three-point, you could bend your knees and get down on your knees. But it was difficult to do that just by trying bending down and hold your balance because, if you tried to go down, it seemed like it was going to throw you forward. It took a lot of energy to hold yourself back when the knees were bent. The suit wanted to pitch you forward when you bent your knees.
122:37:58||alsj|In hopping back to get his balance, John may have kicked some dirt on the base.
122:38:14||alsj|John uses the UHT to straighten the cables.
122:38:29||alsj|John tries to reach down to get the antenna but doesn't quite make it and, in the end, uses the UHT as a crutch so that he can get on his knees. Note that, now that he is finished with the instrument deployment, he doesn't bother turning the UHT end-for-end and sticks the tip in the ground.
122:38:29||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and pans counter-clockwise.
122:40:01||alsj|Three of the four mortars were successfully fired on May 23, 1972, about a month after John and Charlie left the Moon. The mortar that was to have been fired to a range of 1500 meters was not launched due to the fact that the experimenters were no longer sure that the mortar package was level. After the third mortar was launched, either the pitch sensor failed or the mortar package tipped at an unacceptable angle. Excellent data were obtained from the three successful launches and these data, when combined with the thumper data and data recorded during the LM launch, were used to determine the subsurface structure shown in Figure 10-1 from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.
122:40:01||alsj|Fendell stops his pan just as the magnetometer is about to go out of view and reverses direction. On comm, we can hear Charlie's breathing.
122:40:53|Jones|alsj|You're out in front of the Rover now, off-camera collecting a couple of rock samples. Do you have any comments about solo sampling versus team sampling?
122:40:53|Duke|alsj|Well, the solo sampling, generally, you just picked up rocks when you were solo. It was hard to get a soil sample, solo, because you'd get a scoopful and it was really difficult to try to pour it in the bag yourself. Generally, you did that when you had a rakeful or a scoopful, one guy'd pour it into the other. And it was easier to document the samples - you know, the down-Sun, cross-Sun, and all the photographs that we had before and after - with two people. So the real documented samples we always did together. But a lot of times we worked separately because you could pick up more rocks that way.
122:40:53||alsj|&quot;You know, John and I were like two little kids up there, really. You know how hard it is trying to keep two kids going in the same direction at the zoo or Seaworld or something like that. The same problem you have up on the Moon. I see something over here and there I am and there's John. So a lot of times we worked independently; but we told Houston and a lot of our geology stops had independent sampling.&quot;
122:40:53|Jones|alsj|Would you have used the scoop here to grab these rocks or just go down and get them with your hand?
122:40:53|Duke|alsj|I think I was just bending over - you know, doing splits - and getting them with my hand.
122:40:53||alsj|Fendell pans past John, who is headed for the Rover at a leisurely pace, apparently looking around as he goes. Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit.
122:41:03||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the heavily-shadowed LM, which is visible over the top of the Rover console.
122:41:38||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and pans counter-clockwise, He finds John near the Central Station holding Charlie's Hasselblad.
122:41:45||alsj|John runs to the mortar package and starts with an up-Sun picture, AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18376" target="new" target="alsj">18376</a>. As Fendell zooms in, we can see that John hasn't mounted the camera on his RCU and is taking handheld photos. John moves around to the north side of the mortar package and takes a cross-Sun, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18377" target="new" target="alsj">18377</a>. John then moves around to the northeast side, examining the camera as he goes.]</i></blockquote>
122:42:47||alsj|John takes two pictures, AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18378" target="new" target="alsj">18378</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18379" target="new" target="alsj">18379</a>, backing up slightly and stepping to his left between frames.]

You can't really see the geophone line in the background, but you can see where John walked. That's basically his footprints along the geophone line and it trends off to the northwest. And you can see the spaghetti cable that goes back to the Central Station - not only for the data but also for the power. The magnetometer's in the far background, just over the mortar package. You can see the RTG and Central Station in that photograph. There's another piece of little white stuff over here to the upper right but it's, I think, just some debris.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
122:42:47||alsj|John takes his final mortar-package picture, AS16-113-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18380" target="new" target="alsj">18380</a>, from the southeast. The TV image jiggles as Charlie works at the Rover.
122:43:32||alsj|John runs toward the geophone anchor. Fendell follows. John stops to adjust the camera settings.
122:44:14|Young|tech|I tell you, we weren't disappointed about this EVA. We'd been practicing with real deployments on the training gear. Every time we deployed it, we'd have some kind of problem that nobody had ever seen before. Well, we had the same thing in flight. I think all the problems we had with the training gear oriented us for our real-time problems.
122:44:14|Duke|tech|We had ALSEP deployments and that was really good training. I felt right at home with every piece of gear we had.
||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pans left and finds John between the drill-stem rack and the magnetometer.  He has just kicked a football-sized rock and it rolls 3 or 4 meters, angling off to John's left, probably because he hit it off-center.  Fendell continues his counter-clockwise pan.
122:44:15||alsj|As indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf10-3.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-3</a> in the Preliminary Science Report, Charlie has moved his sampling operation to the left rear of the Rover.  On Earth, caliche is a calcium carbonate deposit found on rocks, in cracks in rocks, or in subsurface layers and is a result of water evaporation.  Because there is no water on the Moon, lunar caliche is an impossibility.  Here, Charlie is using the term to convey a visual impression.]
122:44:15||alsj|The white soil location is at about 81.17/CA.60 in Brian McInall's ALSEP Deployment Planimetric Map (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ALSEP-DeploymentPlanimetricMapLROC-M175179080LR_Jan2017.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10 Mb</a>).

122:45:37||alsj|Charlie's rock is sample 60075, a 184-gram piece of brecciated anorthosite which he will put in bag 373 at about 122:47:33.]</i></blockquote>
122:45:40||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit without finding the astronauts.
122:45:55||alsj|Fendell starts panning clockwise.
122:45:55||alsj|Charlie has taken two &quot;after&quot; pictures,  AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18385" target="new" target="alsj">18385</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18386" target="new" target="alsj">18386</a>, which show the scoop stuck in the ground and, as well, some very deep footprints in the far wall of the crater.

He is using Charlie's camera and vice-versa.]</i></blockquote>
122:46:58||alsj|What they are actually doing is putting the sample in a Sample Collection Bag (SCB) which is hanging on the HTC.]</i></blockquote>
122:47:04||alsj|These core tubes are thin-walled tubes which Charlie will hammer into the ground at some of the geology stops.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy84.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">84</a> from Judy Allton's Apollo Tool Catalog shows an SCB that contains two core tubes and three sample bag dispensers.]</i></blockquote>

According to the timeline printed on page 64 in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, they had planned to start the geoprep at 3:56 and, despite the disruptions caused by the loss of the heat flow experiment, they are virtually on schedule.]</i></blockquote>
122:47:33||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the back of the Rover.  He is holding an individual sample bag with the tabs between the thumb and forefinger of either hand.  He spins the bags several times around the axis formed by the stiffening wire in the top of the bag.
122:47:39|Duke|alsj|It worked real good for us.  The bags were like sandwich bags and had some little aluminum clips (tabs) on the end and, normally, people just folded them over and clipped them like a sandwich bag.  But we found that just flipping them was quicker and then folding them in and that would lock it closed.  That's what we did to every bag, if the sample wasn't so big that you...Sometimes we'd put a rock in there that was too big to do that with and couldn't get it closed at all; but we wanted to identify that rock, so we went ahead and put it in a bag so that they'd know where it was on the surface and we could identify it again.  But that flipping it worked real good.  I think the sample bags should have been bigger.  You know, on future missions I think we ought to have bigger sample bags.&quot;]
122:47:39|Muehlberger, from a 1997 e-mail message|alsj|That technique was one that I suggested while watching them on a training exercise. Glad it worked so well!&quot;]
122:47:39||alsj|Charlie folds the tabs across the top of the bag and heads for the CDR seat.  He stops near the left-rear fender and takes the CDR camera off his RCU bracket.]</i></blockquote>
122:48:00||alsj|Charlie puts the CDR camera on the floor pan in front of John's seat.]</i></blockquote>
122:48:04||alsj|John is off-camera to our right, probably holding a dustbrush.
122:48:07||alsj|John puts something down in the floor pan and then turns to Charlie with a camera in his hand.  The following dialog suggests that this is Charlie's camera, the one John has been using.
122:48:12||alsj|John gets the large <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> off the floor pan and starts cleaning the LMP camera.
122:48:25||alsj|Charlie raises the CDR seat.
122:48:40||alsj|Charlie slips the LMP camera onto his RCU bracket.]</i></blockquote>
122:48:48||alsj|Charlie puts his hands out and, off-camera, John dusts them off.
122:49:11||alsj|Charlie has removed magazine A/113 from his camera and is putting it the stowage area under John's seat.  John has the CDR camera and is leaning over the CDR floor pan.
122:49:21||alsj|John steps back from the Rover to dust his camera.]</i></blockquote>
122:49:35||alsj|Charlie removes the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="new" target="alsj">dark slide</a> from the new magazine and puts it in the seat pan.  He raises the magazine to his faceplate.
122:49:35||alsj|Charlie puts the magazine in the camera and takes a test shot, AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17746" target="new" target="alsj">17746</a>.] </i></blockquote>
122:49:54||alsj|Charlie reaches into the seat pan, possibly to put the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="new" target="alsj">dark slide</a> in magazine 113/A.  Then he lowers the CDR seat.
122:50:10||alsj|Charlie goes around the back of the Rover to the LMP seat.  John follows and stops at the back of the vehicle.
122:50:34||alsj|The rock next to the Rover can be seen best in AS16-113- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18365" target="new" target="alsj">18365</a>.]
122:50:34||alsj|Charlie has gotten a sample bag dispenser off his seat and mounts it on the bottom of his camera.
122:50:40||alsj|Charlie has joined John at the back of the Rover and presents the right side of his PLSS so that John can attach an SCB.   Charlie wears his SCB on the right side - and John wears his on the left - so that the bags don't get bumped while John and Charlie are riding.
122:51:11|Duke|tech|Several small screws that hold the aluminum plate and the ring that holds the bags to the camera backed out and the whole ring fell off.  This allowed the bags to still be held to the camera, but to dangle such that you couldn't reach up and pull one off.  We discarded that set of bags.  Luckily, we didn't throw them away.  We put them on the Rover and used them later on.  (I say 'luckily') because we almost ran out of bags.  I recommend we have several sets of those 20-bag dispensers because, it you have any failure like that, it really can slow you up.  The best thing to do is just discard that set of bags and get a new set.  But, the way we were using them, we couldn't afford to do that.
122:51:11|Young|tech|I dropped the bags off the camera out of that place.  During the first EVA, we had taped them on.  Remember?  On the second EVA, we forgot to bring the bags back in (to the cabin) and taped them on the same for the third EVA.&quot;]
122:51:11|Duke|tech|I had them taped on both cameras, but the tape came up.  The gray tape doesn't hold too good on that (dust coated) metal surface.&quot;]
122:51:11|Young|tech|You need some mechanical latch to hold them on.  Probably something that springs up and down.  You need some way to keep them from falling off.  Mine fell off on the second and third EVAs at least ten times, and that really slows you down.  Twice, they fell off when I was driving the Rover.  They just vibrated out.  Fortunately, it fell on the seat, or we would have lost a couple of 20-bag dispensers right there.  I didn't realize that I dropped them until after they were gone.  It seems to me like that's a simple fix. The trouble is, they fell off in training, Deke.  I kept saying, 'Is this flight (gear)?'  Everybody said 'no, the flight one is really stiff and it won't do that.&quot;]
122:51:11|Duke|tech|I think it happened more in flight than it did in training.&quot;]
122:51:11|Young|tech|The system is supposed to handle that, and it didn't.&quot;]
122:51:11||alsj|There are actually two problems discussed here.  One was the repeated failure of the bracket on the side of the 70-mm Hasselblads.]
122:51:11|From the Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|The dispenser is mounted on an adapter (Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-60.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-60</a>) which is inserted in the right sight, tee-slot bracket on the camera.  The adapter-to-tee slot interface is horizontal and depends on springs in the tee slot to hold the adapter in the latched position.  This latching method is inadequate.  The adapter has been re-designed so as to provide a positive lock in the stalled position as shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-60.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-60</a>.&quot;]
122:51:11||alsj|The other problem was a failure of the bag dispensers.
122:51:11||alsj|&quot;The three screws which fasten the bag ring to the bracket plate had come out on one of the documented sample bag dispensers and consequently came apart when unstowed.  The three flat-headed, stainless-steel screws mate with threads in the aluminum ring (Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-61.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-61</a>).  The heads are stakes to the aluminum bracket plate.  Thread sealant materials are not permitted because of the possibility of lunar sample contamination.  The Apollo 17 dispensers will be re-inspected to assure proper staking of the screws and tightness of the threads in the aluminum ring.&quot;
122:51:11||alsj|Neither of these problems re-occurred on Apollo 17.
122:51:17||alsj|Charlie presents the right side of his PLSS again.]</i></blockquote>
122:51:39||alsj|Charlie has leaned forward to raise the bottom of his PLSS and John gets low - probably kneeling - to attach the bottom of the SCB.  Much of what John does is hidden behind the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
122:51:48||alsj|Charlie moves a few steps away from the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
122:51:48||alsj|John has dropped the SCB and bobs down to his right to get it.  In getting up, he has to run a couple of steps forward to get his balance.]</i></blockquote>
122:52:23||alsj|John gets down on his knees to attach the bottom of the bag.]</i></blockquote>
122:53:12||alsj|John stands up and Charlie gets an SCB off the back of the Rover to put on John's PLSS.

122:54:02||alsj|Charlie frees the SCB and John presents the left side of his PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
122:54:18||alsj|John is unsure which way is his right.
122:54:20||alsj|John turns right but then, almost immediately, turns the other way.]</i></blockquote>
122:54:21||alsj|John leans forward so that Charlie can secure the bottom of the SCB.
122:55:24||alsj|Fendell zooms in and pans right.  We get a good close-up of the two pairs of tongs mounted on the tool carrier.

122:56:58||alsj|The planned EVA traverse is shown in the Descartes EVA-I, II 1 of 2 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a>. The named features are shown in a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from a Pan Camera frame. They plan to drive between Spook Carter and Buster Crater and proceed past Halfway Crater and park on the rim of Flag Crater a short way northeast of Plum Crater, a 40-m crater on the rim of Flag. For the broader context, see also, a larger <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sitelm.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> in which the LM can be seen just above center near the right edge of the picture. North is up and the LM is in the bright area created by the engine exhaust on the west side of a small crater. Navigation details for the traverse can be found on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a>, which was printed on the reverse of normal map.
122:56:58||alsj|See, also, an EVA-1 map based on LRO image <a href="http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse/view/nacr00000ad8" target="new" target="alsj">nacr00000ad8</a> , taken 12 July 2009 19:04:51 UTC.  The Sun was low in the west, so the LRV tracks don't show up.  Brian McInall has sketched in the first 100 meters of the tranverse to Station 1 on the ALSEP Deployment Planimetric Map (<a href="A16ALSEP-DeploymentPlanimetricMapLROC-M175179080LR_Jan2017.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10 Mb</a>).
122:56:58|Duke|alsj|The (contour) <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a> was clipped right next to the DAC camera, so I could just reach up and pull it off and look at it. It shows that we were supposed to go out 280 for nine tenths and then off 270 basically on out to Plum for six tenths. But, you know, the maps are based on where you think you're landing, and they made a comment here in the tape that they thought we were farther west. We thought we were farther west than we normally were and, so, we started out, I think at 276...They wanted us to go 274 for seven tenths instead of nine tenths. That indicated that we were north of where we wanted to be and we were west of where we had originally thought we were. Whether that was right or wrong remains to be seen. To be honest, it was difficult to pick out Double Spot (a crater pair near the LM) and Spook and, as we go through this thing, you'll hear a lot of 'Well, I think that's it.' And 'No, maybe it's not.' And we were really unsure at first. You know, this is our first time driving and it's like a you-can't-see-the-forest-for-the-trees type thing.
122:56:58||alsj|John initialized the Nav system at the LM, which is near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CB.1/80.6</a>. They plan to park on the rim of Flag Crater at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CA.9/73.6</a>. Had they landed at the planned spot, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">planned parking place</a> would have corresponded to a LM bearing of 096 and a range of 1.5 km. Because they landed about 200 meters NNW of their target, the planned parking place corresponds to a LM bearing of 88 and a range of 1.4 kilometers.
122:58:45||alsj|This is their current heading. As indicated on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a>, they plan to drive 0.9 kilometers on a heading of 280 to reach Checkpoint 2 midway between Spook and Buster. At that spot, they expect to have a LM bearing of 100 and a range of 0.9. The landing offset will reduce both readings.
122:59:08||alsj|Charlie plans to take Hasselblad pictures at intervals of about 50 meters to document the traverse. In fact, he takes 28 pictures during the 1.4 km drive and hits the 50-meter average interval exactly. Including a short stop, the trip takes about 24 minutes. Charlie's first picture is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17747" target="new" target="alsj">17747</a>, a view to the southwest showing South Ray Crater.]
122:59:08||alsj|Although Jim Irwin took a few pictures from the Apollo 15 Rover on one occasion when Dave Scott stopped to take a brief rest during the EVA-2 traverse to the Apennine Front, documentation of the Apollo 15 traverses was to have made with the 16-mm DAC movie camera. That effort was not successful and, for Apollo 16, Charlie will take pictures at regular intervals to supplement/backup the DAC. Charlie's traverse photography will be so successful that the DAC will not used on the Apollo 17 Rover.
122:59:08||alsj|Because they are planning to use a full magazine of 16-mm film to document John driving the Rover when they get back to the LM at the end of the EVA, the DAC will not be run during the drive to Station 1 or on the drive back to the LM.
122:59:08||alsj|Photos for the first part of the traverse - 17747-68 - are available in a PDF album <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16trv17747-68emj.pdf" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">13 Mb</a>)</i></blockquote>

123:00:37|Jones|alsj|I believe you and John were supposed to have been the first of the Rover crews, back when they were first letting the contracts.
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|Yeah, John and I were going to be the first ones. We started with all that; and we turned it over to Dave and Jim after a while. I remember a time of John and I going out to Santa Barbara and Seattle and going through some design reviews and the original prototypes and going out to Huntsville to ride a simulator at first. But then they moved that (schedule) all around and Dave Scott and Jim took it over. And we just concentrated on the training part.
123:00:37||alsj|According to the late <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrv_historical_origins.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Mitchell R. Sharpe</a>, a Rover historian, NASA made the decision to design and build a Lunar Roving Vehicle on May 23, 1969, the day that the Apollo 10 crew performed a final rehearsal of LM operations in lunar orbit. Once the design team was chosen, a preliminary design review was held on January 18-19, 1970 at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. John, Charlie, and fellow astronaut Gerald Carr attended that meeting. A final design certification review was held at Marshall on June 16/17. On September 2, NASA announced that Dave Scott and Jim Irwin had been given the first Rover mission although, according to the Apollo 15 training logs, Dave and Jim had their first session with a Rover mock-up on August 17.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|Do you remember anything about the initial discussion about the Rover. As an example, I remember reading that the initial design included the same kind of controller that you had in the Command Module: a pistol grip rather than the t-bar you ended up with.
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|Well, it was apparent to us that that wouldn't work. We needed a t-bar. There were some minor things. When I first looked at it, I didn't understand how the wheels were going to work. I mean, they were wire and you could see through 'em. But I'm glad they didn't ask me to design the wheels, 'cause I wouldn't have done it that way. But it worked great. We had some discussion about the seat design, I remember.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|In what regard?
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|Just make sure we could get in it and get out of it easy. And the seat belts. We went through a couple of iterations on that, (to make sure) we could work it in the suit and the one-sixth gravity - make sure we could lock ourselves in and then adjust it. And, in fact, after Apollo 15, they had to go back and we had to re-design. We had a big, over-center handle that we put on it so that we could lock ourselves into the seat. It was really important to do that.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|Because it was a bouncy ride?
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|Yeah. And it was like driving on ice, a lot. The back end kept fishtailing, at least for us. And, then I think we had some problem with switch guards and stuff like that with the big, fat <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a>. We had a little, minor change with those.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|How about the circuit breakers?
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|You'd have to ask John. You know, that was basically his job: driving it, getting it configured right.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|Did you talk with the engineers about configuration of the console and things like that?
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|Well, we looked at it, of course, and it seemed to be a pretty logical layout. We didn't have any major complaints, so that was basically left as is. If I remember, we had a rear-view mirror at first, so we could see behind us to back up. But they took that off. We had reverse; but I don't remember us ever using reverse. Generally, John just did U-turns. Or we just picked it up and turned it around.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|I think Dave used reverse once (at Station 6a). Any discussions you remember about the tool gate on the back and the operation of that.
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|No. You know, those things were pretty standard: the rakes and core tube holders and the little ratchet like you'd see on plumbers' trucks. We had one of those to get the core apart. There wasn't really many changes on the Rover! They changed the pallet a little bit because we had some different experiments, so the brackets had to be changed. But, basically, that went pretty well. That was a good machine. I really thought it was well designed; as quickly as they built it, it was remarkable, I think.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|And NASA took a lot of undeserved heat over cost overruns.
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|I know.
123:00:37|Jones|alsj|Some people didn't understand that, when you're only making three of a thing, they're going to be expensive.
123:00:37|Duke|alsj|Plus a short time fuse and working three shifts a day. And there's a lot of unknowns in that kind of stuff and it's hard to plan for it.
123:00:37||alsj|This may be the boulder shown in AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17752" target="new" target="alsj">17752</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:01:40||alsj|Readers should note the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a> shows a featured named Eden Valley south of Flag Crater and well west of their current position. Eden Valley also shows up nicely on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from the Pan Camera frame and probably represents one or more very old, eroded craters. There is another depression southeast of Spook and south of their current location. This is probably the 'valley' Charlie is seeing, although the name 'Hidden Valley' does not appear on any of the maps I have seen.
123:01:54||alsj|Tony is asking for their current speed and the ampere reading.
123:02:40|Jones|alsj|Was most of the ride like what we saw in the film last night of John doing the Grand Prix?
123:02:40|Duke|alsj|Yeah. It was bouncy. That's why I made the comment that we could really let her go because we were cinched in. You never felt like it was going to turn over on you but you got this fishtail action a lot. The steering was real sensitive and, in the light gravity, it tended to fishtail on the back end a lot.
123:02:40|Unidentified speaker|tech|Say something about Rover driving out there in zero phase.
123:02:40|Young|tech|Man, I'll tell you, that is really grim. I was scared to go more than 4 or 5 kilometers an hour. Going out there, looking dead ahead, I couldn't see the craters. I could see the blocks alright and avoid them. But I couldn't see craters. I couldn't see benches. I was scared to go more than 4 or 5 clicks. Maybe some times I got up to 6 or 7, but I ran through a couple of craters because I flat missed (seeing) them until I was on top of them. And, I don't recommend driving in zero phase (which is the direction directly opposite the Sun). (Pre-flight) they kept saying they wanted it included in the traverse, and I specifically cautioned them not to include it on the traverse. But, there is no way for us to get to Flag Crater without driving in zero phase. It sure is grim. The other direction (on the way back to the LM) was about twice as good. I saw my tracks on the way back. We were doing 7, 8, 9, and 10 clicks. It wasn't any good during the traverses where we were going down-Sun. I was tacking a lot of times. But, when you got to a ridge, you couldn't tell if it was a drop-off, or whether it was a smooth, shallow ridge. In a couple of cases, you couldn't see there was a ridge. I didn't care for that much. It's kind of like landing an airplane aboard ship where you're looking right into the Sun and you can't see what you're doing. You just go ahead and land it anyway. It is not normal but, on occasion, you have to do it. But you'd just as soon not.
123:02:40||alsj|The almost complete lack of detail at zero phase is due, in part, to objects hiding their own shadows and, most importantly, to a dramatic brightening caused by the phenomenon of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../coherentbcksctr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Coherent Backscatter</a>.
123:03:20||alsj|The formal definition of 'cobble' is a piece of rock between about 6.4 cm and 25.6 cm.
123:03:20|Duke|alsj|Looking, later, at the pictures, that was a high estimate (of surface coverage).
123:03:20||alsj|Charlie's pictures on this part of the drive may be AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17753" target="new" target="alsj">17753</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17755" target="new" target="alsj">17755</a>. Frame 17755 gives a good indication of the small scale, local undulation of the terrain. The fact that we can see the shadows of both helmets means that the Rover is pitched down considerably. This is one of only a few pictures of this kind in the Apollo collection.

123:04:50|Duke|alsj|I was moving around, taking pictures and reaching for maps and stuff like that; and, as I moved around in my seat, I'd keep hitting John's arm and it would knock him over. And, when I hit his arm, it would move the handle and it would turn the vehicle. And he was getting a little frustrated with me, for which I don't blame him. But it's really hard to stay out of his way. You had plenty of room as far as fore and aft goes; but, side-by-side, we were sort of shoulder-to-shoulder and it was difficult to stay out of his way. If we had it to do again, maybe we ought to design the Rover a little bit wider so the passenger wouldn't be knocking the guy's arm.
123:04:50|Jones|alsj|The T-handle was really in the center, wasn't it?
123:04:50|Duke|alsj|Right in the center. Yeah. Either one of us could drive. I could have driven with my left hand. We didn't do it that way; but we had trained a little bit where I could drive it, too.
123:04:58||alsj|Charlie's photos taken during this part of the traverse are AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17757" target="new" target="alsj">17757</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17761" target="new" target="alsj">17761</a>.

123:05:03|Duke|tech|I think the whole way out there, we were in this series of rays from South Ray.
123:05:03|Young|tech|You couldn't tell where one took up and the other left off.
123:05:03|Jones|alsj|There's a nuance here that I don't get. You were talking along and then you said, 'Go ahead, John.' And there was certainly no verbal cue that he had something he wanted to say.
123:05:03|Duke|alsj|I don't know whether he nudged me or whether I saw him looking over to the left.
123:05:03|Jones|alsj|Could you have seen him in the seat? Did you have enough peripheral vision that you could see him?
123:05:03|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
123:05:03|Jones|alsj|Did you ride with the Gold Visor down?
123:05:03|Duke|alsj|Yeah, the Gold visor was down, but the opaque side-blinders weren't down.
123:05:03|Jones|alsj|Could you see him?
123:05:03|Duke|alsj|Yeah, I think so.
123:05:03|Jones|alsj|That is, through the helmet and you could see where he was looking.
123:05:03|Duke|alsj|No, I couldn't do that. Now that I think of it, when he turned, he would just turn inside the helmet and he would still be facing forward (meaning that the suit wouldn't have moved). So I don't know what I was thinking about, here.
123:05:36||alsj|At Charlie's last report, they were at a bearing of 091 and a range of 0.5 km. The LM is near CB.1/80.6 and they are currently near CB.1/78.1. They are about 100 meters from the northwest rim of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Spook</a>. See the Descartes, EVA-I, II; 1 of 2 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a>.
123:05:42|Duke|alsj|If we were landed two hundred meters farther west, it would be 100 at point seven. But, but I make the comment here, 'No, we're only at point six.' So I failed to make that deduction (in the sense of 'subtraction'). I think we figured it out in a little bit.
123:05:42|Duke|tech|We felt as if we'd landed a little bit west of where we were supposed to, and that the distances (meaning the ranges to the LM along this traverse) would be shorter (than shown on the map).
123:05:42|Young|tech|They didn't turn out to be.

123:06:57|Jones|alsj|Was there any emphasis in training on making sure you were describing what you were doing?
123:06:57|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah. Especially on the way with the Rover, because we didn't have any TV camera. And so I was sort of the running travel guide, taking pictures and describing the terrain as we traveled across, you know, from point A to point B. Going out to Plum, and then going up to Stone Mountain. As John drove, I was navigating, describing the terrain we were going over and taking pictures every few meters.
123:06:57|Jones|alsj|Now, Jim didn't take pictures. Do you remember any explicit discussions during planning for this one...
123:06:57|Duke|alsj|Yeah. The geologists realized they were going to get a lot of terrain that they weren't going to get to see what it was like without pictures. So we budgeted, in the film budget, pictures during the traverses. I didn't realize Jim didn't do it. That was the first mission with the Rover, and they just hadn't thought about it. So, as they drove, they just realized, 'Man, we got a lot of gaps in our coverage, here.' If we were going to go from wherever to wherever, you know, it might be two kilometers and we'd like to see what that looks like. So we drove and took pictures and described.
123:06:57||alsj|In 1996, I asked Bill Muehlberger if he remembered &quot;any discussions that led to the decision to have Charlie take Hasselblad pictures during the traverses. Was it because of doubts about the performance of the 16mm camera? Or did somebody say 'Hey, film doesn't weigh much and having the LMP take pictures doesn't cost us anything?'&quot;
123:06:57|Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter|alsj|As I remember - albeit poorly - because we were landing in an area with visible rays from South Ray Crater, we wanted to know how much of the surface was really covered. The 16mm camera was fixed in the direction of the Rover, whereas the LMP could move his body to get the best possible pictures. So, use an intelligent observer who could take pictures close enough together that we could locate each shot relative to the previous one and then make a map of relative rockiness on the line of travel. See our report for the results. Horribly time consuming and amazingly - to me, at least - low percentage of visible rocks.
123:06:57||alsj|The results of this study are presented in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-6LPI.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-6</a> from the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.

123:09:19||alsj|Tony is discussing the feature mapped at CA.7/77.0 on the Descartes EVA-I, III 2 of 2 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a>.
123:09:19|Young|tech|You know, we never encountered any of these features on the geology map. They were mapped at scarps of steep features that they said we were going to have to drive around or over of maybe we could pick up outcrop. We just never ran into those. And I think that's because those (pre-flight) photo analysis guys were reaching for and pulling out features that weren't there. I mean, I looked for these things and sure enough, if you really imagined it, you could see something there. But, I think with that scarping we had (on the map), they were reaching for it. Because they sure weren't there in the real world. If they were (there), they looked like every other slope that was around there.
123:09:19||alsj|The following is taken from a December 8, 1986 conversation between Andrew Chaikin and John Young. My thanks to Chaikin for providing this material.
123:09:19|Chaikin|alsj|Do you remember being particularly surprised by any geologic aspect of the EVAs? Was there any one thing that stands out to you as a surprise?
123:09:19|Young|alsj|Well, the whole Descartes thing was sort of a surprise in some areas and sort of not in other areas, in terms of the technical aspects of it. Driving down-Sun, you can just barely see where you're going when you've got a sun angle that's low right over your shoulder. And our first EVA was all down-Sun, so you had to be very careful how fast you went. It was very tricky.
123:09:19||alsj|&quot;Well, the sad part of that was there had been some studies by some people that had said there were 3- to 5-meter scarps all over this area, because we didn't have very good...The best photography we had was, I think, 20 meters. Stu (Roosa, the Apollo 14 CMP) shot this in the (Apollo 14 CSM) cockpit, and it was good photography, but you just couldn't get any better than 20 meters. So here we are driving down-Sun. You can't see a darn thing and we're supposed to go over a 5- or 3-meter scarp, and I was very nervous about that. But they just weren't there.&quot;
123:09:46||alsj|Although Charlie can't turn the suit very much while seated, he can turn is head inside the bubble helmet and, consequently, gets at least a 180-degree view.
123:10:29|Duke|alsj|Well, you can see it from the photographs. We've already talked about it a little bit; but zero-phase just basically washes everything out - the craters, the slope, and, also, the smaller rocks.
123:10:29|Jones|alsj|So you would only see things as you got close enough...
123:10:29|Duke|alsj|And then they would start coming through the glare. It was like looking at a glare. The rocks just reflected a lot and the surface just reflected a lot of the Sun into your eyes and, so, it got real bright down zero-phase. Whether we were walking or driving or taking pictures, when you looked down-Sun, it was real bright.
123:10:29|Jones|alsj|Did John try tacking at all on this...
123:10:29|Duke|alsj|We did a little bit; but nothing significant.
123:10:29|Jones|alsj|This was the only zero-phase driving you did, I think.
123:10:29|Duke|alsj|Yeah. Most of the time we were cross-Sun. Traverse 2 and 3 we were cross-Sun. There were a little going down-Sun and into the Sun going up to North Ray Crater. You would think going into the Sun was harder, but it wasn't.
123:10:29||alsj|The brightness of zero-phase is chiefly due to a process called Coherent Backscatter, which is discussed by Bruce Hapke in the journal </i>Science<i> vol. 260, pages 509-511, 23 April 1993.   My thanks to Ron Wells for the reference.
123:10:39||alsj|They left the ALSEP site at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1225906" target="new" target="alsj">122:59:06</a> and have covered a straight-line distance of a kilometer in about 11.5 minutes. Their net speed, therefore, is a cautious 5.2 km/hour. Because they have had to maneuver to get around craters, they have probably driven about ten percent farther than a kilometer and their typical speed over short distances has probably been closer to 6 km/hour.
123:10:39||alsj|The photos taken during this part of the traverse are AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17766" target="new" target="alsj">17766</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17768" target="new" target="alsj">17768</a>.

123:10:42||alsj|They may have run through an unseen crater or turned suddenly to avoid one.
123:10:56||alsj|Charlie is mistaken. As he mentions in a moment, the bearing to the LM is 088 and is the range is 1.0 km. They are near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CA.9/75.6</a> on the eastern rim of an anonymous crater immediately south of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Halfway</a> crater.

123:12:50||alsj|They are near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CA.8/75.1</a>. The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRO_EVA-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">anonymous crater</a> has a diameter of 35 meters, comprable to that of Plum.  It is roughly in the same location relative to Halfway as Plum is to Flag, but the diameter of Halfway is only about one third of Flag's 300 meters.
123:14:19||alsj|In a few moments, John and Charlie decide that they are near Halfway and decide to drive on. Shortly after they re-mount the Rover at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1231724" target="new" target="alsj">123:17:24</a>, Charlie takes AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17769" target="new" target="alsj">17769</a>. Note the footprints at the front of the Rover, which indicate that the picture was taken during this brief stop. A comparison of this picture with Figure  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-15</a> in the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> indicates that <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17769" target="new" target="alsj">17769</a> shows an unnamed, 40-m crater immediately south of Halfway Crater. Note the telltale dimple crater in the south rim. This 40-m crater is about the same size as Plum and is in about the right location relative to Halfway to be mistaken for Plum. The major difference in the two settings is the fact that the size ratio between Halfway and this 40-m crater doesn't match to size ratio of Flag and Plum.]
123:14:19||alsj|The remaining frames in the traverses - 17769-74 - are available in a PDF album (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16trv17769-74emj.pdf" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4 Mb</a>).
123:14:34||alsj|Because of a strategically-placed cut-out in the Rover seats, they are able to reach the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">controls on the bottom of the PLSS</a> while seated.
123:14:40||alsj|Charlie really isn't sure they are at Flag/Plum.
123:15:34||alsj|They are going to climb back on the Rover.
123:15:34|Duke|tech|We got to a crater that turned out to be Halfway Crater.
123:15:34|Young|tech|It was a really big crater.
123:15:34|Duke|tech|We weren't to Flag...(and) the reason we realized we weren't there was because the distance was only about three quarters (of the expected distance from the LM).
123:15:34|Young|tech|(On the map), Halfway Crater looked as if it was 100 meters across.
123:15:34|Duke|tech|The craters all looked bigger (than they really are).
123:15:34|Young|tech|Flag Crater is 300 meters across. What we're saying is we couldn't tell the difference between a 100- and a 300-meter crater. And that's the truth.
123:15:34|Duke|tech|I think it's the sharpness of the land and the degree of the subduing of the craters.
123:15:34|Young|tech|You know, I would have been willing to buy that for being Spook Crater (probably means Flag). But it wasn't.
123:15:34|Duke|tech|When we got to Flag, there was no question. 'Man, this is a big crater.' It was a lot bigger than the one where we stopped first.
123:15:34||alsj|The locking pin on John's purge valve has pulled out.
123:16:27||alsj|We can hear Charlie's breathing. He is probably getting up off his knees.
123:16:52||alsj|Here, Charlie is commenting on the difficulty of judging sizes and distances. There is little to distinguish the individual craters, at least at first look.
123:16:52||alsj|We hear John and Charlie huffing, puffing, and grunting as they get seated.
123:18:55||alsj|They have been stopped for about 7 minutes.
123:18:55||alsj|After John starts forward, Charlie takes AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17770" target="new" target="alsj">17770</a> which shows the west side of the 40-meter crater south of Halfway.]

That's the Cinco area.&quot;  These two images are combined in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-17769-70.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">strip form</a>.]
123:18:55|Jones|alsj|Just below that white patch on the hillside.
123:18:55|Duke|alsj|And then, the right-hand photograph shows a good view of South Ray off in the distance. As you can see, we've got no real problems here. There are no big, major blocks out there, so John can just let her go.
123:18:55||alsj|As John mentions in a moment, the poor visibility is holding him back.
123:19:04||alsj|If Charlie is looking at Halfway, his estimate is excellent.

123:22:19|Duke|tech|Plum was smaller than Buster. Plum and Buster were supposed to be the same size; (but) Buster was gigantic compared to Plum.
123:22:19|Young|tech|I expected Plum to have a bright rim around it like it has in the photos. It didn't have a bright rim around it; but, when we dug down 2 inches, there was all this white material.

Note that the rim crest to rim crest distance is about one fiducial spacing.  South Ray Crater is about 700 meters in diameter and is about 5.5 kilometers south of their present location at Flag Crater.  On the far rim of Plum Crater, note the partially buried boulder, which John and Charlie will sample after they finish their work near the Rover.

123:27:34|Jones|alsj|I don't remember that you ever saw anything that looked like bedrock to you, except at North Ray.
123:27:34|Duke|alsj|Yeah. North Ray was the only spot.  I wouldn't say that anything else was.  At North Ray, I think we had some on that far rim, on the west rim.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
123:28:30||alsj|Charlie has completed his first pan at a spot indicated by the circled &quot;1&quot; on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev123.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-23</a>.

Because of the down-Sun washout, it is all but impossible to tell that we are looking across to the far wall of Flag Crater.  Fendell starts panning clockwise.]</i></blockquote>
123:29:02||alsj|As Fendell pans around to the left, we begin to see enough difference in the foreground lighting to see the interior of Plum and a large rock - now known as Big Muley - on the near rim.  Big Muley and a similarly-sized, anonymous rock are shown in a labeled version of AS16-109-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-17789det.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">17789</a>.
123:29:11||alsj|In the distance, we can see the white South Ray ejecta blanket.
123:29:29||alsj|The inbound Rover tracks come into view, with Stone Mountain in the background.
123:29:55||alsj|Charlie may be referring to a decal on his camera which is reproduced in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp449.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">5.3-2</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  A down-Sun photo, taken toward 12 o'clock, is taken at f/11.  Cross-Sun photos are taken at f/8 and up-Sun photos at f/5.6.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp192.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.3-1</a> shows that the standard sampling photo set consists of an f/11 down-Sun taken at an 11-foot focal distance, and a cross-Sun stereopair taken at f/8 from a 7-foot focal distance.  The next frame in the set, which can be taken at any time, is the so-called &quot;Locator&quot; which is a picture of the Rover, the LM, or of a horizon feature so that the sample location can be determined in post-flight analysis.  After the sample is collected, a final photo, called the 'after', is taken at f/8 from 7 feet cross-Sun.]</i></blockquote>
123:30:05||alsj|Off-camera, John may be putting the gnomon on the rake site.  Charlie will take a down-Sun photo from 11 feet away while John takes a cross-Sun stereopair.]
123:30:05||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit.
123:30:20||alsj|Charlie has mis-spoken.  He is using magazine Golf, also known as AS16-109.]</i></blockquote>
123:30:22||alsj|What John means is that Charlie's shadow is falling on the sample area.
123:30:32||alsj|Fendell reverses direction.  This clockwise pan gives a superb illustration of the character of the view changes with sun angle.]
123:30:32||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17794" target="new" target="alsj">17794</a>, which he took after he moved.  Flag Crater is in the background.

In the background, we can see the Rover, Plum Crater, South Ray Crater, and Stone Mountain.] </i></blockquote>
123:30:43||alsj|The dialog over the next several minutes suggest that Charlie is the one using the rake.]</i></blockquote>
123:31:02||alsj|This is not the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">cooling control</a> but, rather, is the on/off valve for the primary water supply.  The Primary tank holds about 8.5 pounds of water and the Auxiliary tank holds about 3.5 pounds.]</i></blockquote>
123:32:19||alsj|According to the Apollo 16 Mission Report, Charlie is using feedwater at a much higher rate than John.  See, also, the dialog at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta2.html#1241438" target="new" target="alsj">124:14:38</a>.  During this first EVA, Charlie will use 11.62 pounds of water while John will use only 9.08 pounds.  Pre-flight estimates indicated they would both use 9.04 pounds.  Charlie will have about 0.42 pounds of water remaining at the end of the EVA.  The EVA started at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new" target="alsj">118:53:33</a> and, consequently, they are about 279 minutes into what will be a 431-minute EVA.  John will switch to Aux water at some point after  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvlm1.html#1250015" target="new" target="alsj">125:00:15</a>, which is 367 minutes into the EVA.  The Primary Water tank holds about 8 pounds.  During the 444 minutes of EVA-2, John will use 9.48 pound and Charlie will use 10.28; and during the 341 minutes of EVA-3, John will use 8.21 pounds and Charlie will use 8.38 pounds.]
123:32:19||alsj|Fendell is looking across Plum Crater with Big Muley on the left side of the TV pictures and, near the center on the far rim, a flat, white rock that John and Charlie will sample later in their Station 1 activities.  Photos AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18420" target="new" target="alsj">18420</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18421" target="new" target="alsj">18421</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18422" target="new" target="alsj">18422</a> are part of a pan Charlie took near that rock.  These frames show the rock and, on the far side of Plum, the Rover.  A portion of Flag Crater is at the upper left in 18420.]</i></blockquote>
123:32:26||alsj|From the evidence of rake samples taken later in this mission and on other missions, after each swath Charlie raises the rake and shakes the loose soil out.  Rocks larger than about 1 cm will stay in the rake and, apparently, most of the rocks Charlie is sweeping up are smaller than that.
123:32:38||alsj|Charlie will rake a few more swaths.
123:32:38||alsj|As Fendell pans through northwest, we begin to see features on the far wall of Flag Crater.]
123:32:38|Duke|alsj|Flag Crater is almost washed away, here.  It's hard to see when you look at zero-phase.  And that's a big crater, you know, a couple hundred meters across and, until you get up towards the north, you really can't even see it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
123:33:02||alsj|John is probably asking if Charlie wants him to hold the individual sample bag at waist height or at knee height while Charlie pours in the collected rocks.]</i></blockquote>
123:33:24||alsj|Fendell has reached the clockwise pan limit and John and Charlie are just barely visible over the Rover console.
123:33:38||alsj|Tony is asking if Charlie was encountering any soil clods which would have fallen apart when Charlie shook the rake.
123:33:38||alsj|While Charlie rakes, John takes AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18392" target="new" target="alsj">18392</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18393" target="new" target="alsj">18393</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18394" target="new" target="alsj">18394</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:34:06||alsj|John was probably putting the individual sample bag in the Sample Collection Bag mounted on the right side of Charlie's PLSS.
123:34:06||alsj|Fendell zooms in to get as good a view of John and Charlie as is possible in the circumstances.  Charlie is standing to John's right.  They have their backs to the TV camera.]</i></blockquote>
123:34:16||alsj|Charlie will use the side of the rake to scoop up a bagful of soil. AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18690" target="new" target="alsj">18690</a> is a good close-up of the rake.]</i></blockquote>
123:34:36||alsj|Charlie turns 90 degrees to his left.
123:34:46||alsj|Charlie raises the rake and pours some soil into the bag John is holding.]</i></blockquote>
123:34:59||alsj|Charlie raises the scoop again.
123:35:09||alsj|John tries the trick of spinning the bag shut while holding onto the tabs with both hands.
123:35:35||alsj|John goes over to Charlie, who presents his SCB so John can put in the sample bag.
123:35:44||alsj|John turns and takes an 'after' of the rake site, AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18395" target="new" target="alsj">18395</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:35:58||alsj|John reaches down with his left hand to get the gnomon.]</i></blockquote>
123:36:08||alsj|Charlie takes the rake to the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
123:36:30||alsj|Charlie puts the rake in its stowage bracket.  John has picked a site for their first rock sample.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-21.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-21</a> from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> is a sketch map showing where John and Charlie took samples near the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
123:36:39||alsj|Charlie pushes hard on the base of the rake and the Rover moves in response.
123:36:52||alsj|With the rake now secure, Charlie grabs the scoop and goes out NNE of the Rover to join John.  Fendell pans to the clockwise limit to find them.
123:37:14||alsj|By using less than adequate cooling, the body overheats and has to be cooled later.
123:37:36||alsj|John has the gnomon down and has already taken a cross-Sun stereopair of 'before' photos.  These are AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18396" target="new" target="alsj">18396</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18397" target="new" target="alsj">18397</a>.  He is getting a sample bag ready.]</i></blockquote>
123:37:45||alsj|Charlie is in position to take the down-Sun before, AS16-109-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17796" target="new" target="alsj">17796</a>.  Note the small rock two fiducials to the right of center.
123:38:04||alsj|Because our view is mostly blocked by the console and a cable, it is not clear who is wielding the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
123:38:43|Duke|alsj|We were expecting to find some rounded rocks, but there weren't any.
123:39:11||alsj|According to Bailey and Ulrich, these samples are 61150 and 61155 to 58.  61155 is a 48-gram of &quot;partial molten breccia&quot;, meaning a rock which had partly melted during formation; and 61156 is a 59-gram igneous rock.  Even in this small area, they are getting good variety, even if the dust coatings are making identification difficult on samples this small.
123:39:11||alsj|Charlie's locator is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17797" target="new" target="alsj">17797</a>.  The small rock noted in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17796" target="new" target="alsj">17796</a> is two fiducials right and two down in this photo.]</i></blockquote>
123:39:34||alsj|Charlie has moved back to the east side of the gnomon. Because Charlie's SCB is on the left side of his PLSS, John goes around the gnomon clockwise to get to it.  After John puts the sample bag in Charlie's SCB, he gets another bag ready so that Charlie can fill it with soil. Charlie does that while he talks to Tony.]</i></blockquote>
123:40:21||alsj|John puts bag 363 in Charlie's SCB.
123:40:29||alsj|Charlie gets out of the way, hopping sideways to his left and circling the gnomon counter-clockwise.
123:40:31||alsj|John took the before from the south side and, so, moves back around to the south side so the before and the after are taken from about the same place.  Following in Charlie's wake, he hops sideways to his left.  Once he gets into position, he takes a stereopair from the south, AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18398" target="new" target="alsj">18398</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18399" target="new" target="alsj">18399</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:40:41||alsj|John grabs the gnomon while Charlie moves from our right to our left behind the Rover.
123:40:45|Jones|alsj|Why are you saying 5 cm is a good sample size?  Small enough that it would go in the bag?  And big enough so that they'd have something to work with?
123:40:45|Duke|alsj|Yeah, and it's characteristic of the rocks (that help determine the desired size).  You know, if you get it too small, you wouldn't have the clasts and all.  But 5 cm - a couple of inches - gave you some clasts and breccia fragments and stuff like that.&quot;]
123:40:45|Jones|alsj|So, basically, you wanted to get the biggest thing that would fit in the bag.
123:40:45|Duke|alsj|Well, that's what we tried to do.  Yeah.  Except for the rake sample.  The rake would trap things that were, I think, above a half-inch.
123:40:45||alsj|Houston decides that they won't see much of what John and Charlie and doing; so Fendell begins a counter-clockwise pan.
123:41:12||alsj|Fendell stops and examines the large, fresh craters on the north wall of Flag.
123:41:12||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun before of this third sample site is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17798" target="new" target="alsj">17798</a>.  John's cross-Sun stereopair is AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18400" target="new" target="alsj">18400</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18401" target="new" target="alsj">18401</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:41:45||alsj|Fendell resumes the counter-clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
123:42:18||alsj|This is sample 61175, a 0.5 kg breccia.
123:42:34||alsj|A sample bag may have just bounced out of Charlie's SCB.   John's cross-Sun after is AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18402" target="new" target="alsj">18402</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:42:48||alsj|John has probably tried to bob down to one knee to get the sample bag and has fallen.
123:42:48||alsj|Fendell stops and zooms in on Big Muley.  There appears to be at least one large, white patch - possibly a clast - near the top.
123:43:29||alsj|Fendell resume the counter-clockwise pan.
123:43:52||alsj|The only large rock Charlie has described so far is the boulder on the southwest rim of Plum opposite their present location.  Charlie mentioned it at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1232736" target="new" target="alsj">123:27:36</a>.  Tony's question was poorly stated and did not indicate that the rock of interest (Big Muley)  is near the front of the Rover.
123:44:02||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise limit.  John and Charlie are off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>
123:44:31||alsj|Fendell starts panning clockwise.  John is probably putting the soil sample in Charlie's SCB.
123:44:45||alsj|John's after of the soil sample is AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18403" target="new" target="alsj">18403</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:45:07||alsj|Formally, a 'cobble' is a piece of rock between about 6.4 cm and 25.6 cm in size.  Larger pieces are boulders; smaller pieces are pebbles.  Charlie has learned to use the term correctly.
123:45:35||alsj|Charlie has probably taken a down-Sun before, AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17799" target="new" target="alsj">17799</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:45:41||alsj|Evidently, John didn't position the gnomon with the color chart facing the Sun.  He has probably re-oriented it.]</i></blockquote>
123:45:52||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie working on the northeast rim of Plum.  Charlie is in the background and takes a picture past John toward the Rover.  This picture is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17800" target="new" target="alsj">17800</a> and it shows John taking cross-Suns AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18404" target="new" target="alsj">18404</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18405" target="new" target="alsj">18405</a>.  John has the hammer in his right <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a> and an SCB on the left side of his PLSS.  The relatively large rock on the right side of the picture near the Rover is Big Muley.  After taking the cross-Suns, John gets a sample bag ready.]</i></blockquote>
123:46:37||alsj|Charlie gets into position with his back to us and slides the scoop under a fist-sized rock next to the up-Sun gnomon leg.  As he raises the rock, it starts to fall out of the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
123:46:48||alsj|Because things fall so slowly on the Moon, Charlie is able to bat the rock upward repeatedly as he chases it to his right.  It finally falls to the ground.]</i></blockquote>
123:46:56||alsj|Charlie gets the rock in the scoop and raises it high enough that John can grab it.  John shakes his hand to try to get some of the dust off.  This is sample 61135, a 0.25 kg breccia.
123:47:07||alsj|While John describes the rock to Houston, Charlie returns to the gnomon and uses the scoop to collect a second rock.  He raises it to chest height.  He has the extension handle hilt in his left hand and maneuvers the scoop so that he can take hold of the handle near the scoop head with his right hand.  He then moves his left hand down the handle and, finally, is able to grab the rock with his right hand.
123:47:09||alsj|John has put the rock in the bag he was holding, rolls the top closed - rather than spinning it shut - and then folds the tabs over.   Then John appears to take a picture, probably AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18406" target="new" target="alsj">18406</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:47:09||alsj|This sample, 61195, is actually a 0.59 kg anorthosite.  Charlie joins John and presents his SCB so that John can put bag 362 in.]
123:47:09|Jones|alsj|Did a lot of the rocks have glass coatings?
123:47:09|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  In our area they did.  I don't remember whether it was the rocks had melted themselves or whether there was a hot rock that just splashed on it and coated it with glass.  It was a little of both, I think.  This one probably had a glass coating; it looked like something had splashed over it, a lot of times, and solidified.  That big House Rock on the last EVA (at North Ray Crater), I remember distinctly, it was glass. The rock itself was glass, which is almost like obsidian, which indicates that the rock got real hot and it was vitrified.&quot;]
123:47:09|Jones|alsj|What Jack describes sometimes on 17 is places where you get a small meteorite come in and hit the surface of a rock and you get a little splash around the sides of the crater.&quot;]
123:47:09|Duke|alsj|That could have been one of the processes.  They had a special name for that, and I forget the name for these micrometeorites that hit the rock.&quot;]
123:47:09|Jones|alsj|Zap-pits
123:47:09|Duke|alsj|Zap-pits.  Yeah, that was it.  And we saw some of that.  Yeah.  I think we describe it later on.&quot;]
123:47:09|Jones|alsj|And then there were ones with more of a complete (coating)...&quot;]
123:47:09|Duke|alsj|It had splashed, yeah.  We'd seen that out in Hawaii - you know, liquid lava come out and splash around.  That's what it looked like to me.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
123:48:20||alsj|Charlie turns to face the Sun while John reaches in and gets a bag off Charlie's camera.  They will have repeated troubles with the sample bag holders.]</i></blockquote>
123:48:33||alsj|Charlie holds the rock out so John can see it more clearly. John is getting the bag ready.
123:48:39||alsj|Charlie puts the rock in the bag and, while John seals the bag, Charlie turns to take a good look at Flag Crater.]</i></blockquote>
123:49:42||alsj|John has taken a very long time to seal the bag.]</i></blockquote>
123:49:44||alsj|John finally puts bag 2 in Charlie's SCB.
123:50:00||alsj|John's second after is probably AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18407" target="new" target="alsj">18407</a>.  Charlie takes up a position south of the gnomon.  John gets a bag ready.] </i></blockquote>
123:50:00||alsj|It takes a moment for John to get the bag open.  Charlie goes over to him and then pours the soil in the bag.]</i></blockquote>
123:50:17||alsj|Charlie presents his SCB.
123:50:44||alsj|John is hidden from view but is probably taking an after, AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18408" target="new" target="alsj">18408</a>.  Charlie turns and heads south to go around the rim of Plum to the large, buried boulder on the far side.]</i></blockquote>
123:50:58||alsj|While John grabs the gnomon, Charlie stops to look at a footprint one of them made on the soft rim of Plum just west of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
123:50:58||alsj|The bright, white color of the sunlit wall of the footprint can be seen in the TV picture
123:51:18||alsj|The local surface rises from the area of the Rover west to the Plum rim.  The footprint is near the rim and Charlie positions himself slightly downhill of the footprint.  He sticks the scoop head in the ground, with the flat, bottom surface of the scoop rimward, and pulls the scoop toward the Rover to create a vertical, sunlit face.  The soil he removes with the scoop is noticeably brighter than the normal regolith it falls on.  Note that Charlie has to use both hands on the scoop to do the trenching.]
123:51:18|Duke|alsj|It was easy for me that way.  I didn't have the strength to do it one-handed.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
123:51:28||alsj|John moves in, takes the scoop in his right hand and digs in another area a couple of feet away.  He uses the same type of motion Charlie used.  Below a two or three inch depth, he starts bringing up very white material.
123:51:29||alsj|Charlie had made a wall facing the TV camera and John's is oriented at an angle.
123:51:58||alsj|John gives the scoop to Charlie and goes to the Rover, carrying the gnomon with him.
123:52:09||alsj|Charlie starts a trench slightly south of the place where he first dug.  He positions the scoop with each stroke so that he can create a vertical wall facing the Sun.  On his third stroke, he manages to pull himself forward and off balance, but avoids the trench by taking a step forward and then hopping onward to regain his balance.  He ends up northwest of the trench.
123:52:09|Jones|alsj|As you dug trench, two-handed again, it looked like you actually pulled yourself forward slightly.
123:52:09|Duke|alsj|Yeah, I did.  I got it down and it jerked me forward.&quot;]
123:52:09|Jones|alsj|You rotated forward over your feet real slow.  And eventually got over your toes and had to walk forward two or three steps.  That's amazing how much time you had to react to things like that.&quot;]
123:52:09|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  It was sort of a slow motion, everything felt like.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
123:52:28||alsj|Charlie hops sideways and stops north of the trench.]</i></blockquote>
123:52:33|Duke|tech|There was about 3 cm of gray regolith and, right under that, it was just white ash.  It was white when we put it in the bag.  I don't know what it looks like right now; but it was white when we put it in the bag.  Just ash white.
123:52:33|Mattingly|tech|Some of the other things that looked white, when we got them inside (the CM), (they) were pretty black.
123:52:33|Young|tech|If it doesn't look white, I'll eat every bit.
123:52:33|Unidentified speaker|tech|It was sure marshmellowy (meaning 'very white') when we got it.
123:52:33||alsj|The unidentified speaker is probably saying that the sample looked bright white when inspected in the Lunar Receiving Lab in Houston.]
123:52:33||alsj|The following discussion of the possible origin on the white soil and the covering layer comes from the Apollo 16 Preliminary Science Report: &quot;The median grain size of most soil samples ranges from 76 to 112/am. However, the two samples from North Ray Crater (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LunarSampleCompendium67481.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">67480</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LunarSampleCompendium67601.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">67600</a>) and one whitish soil from station 1 (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_61220_53.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Sample 61220</a>) are much coarser; the median grain size ranges from 250 to 300 microns.&quot;
123:52:33||alsj|&quot;It is noteworthy that the three coarser soils all have relatively low abundances of agglutinates as well as relatively low nickel contents. The concurrence of these three parameters suggests that these soils have been subject to gardening for a much shorter time than the typical soft. The occurrence of an immature soil in the bottom of the trench at station 1 (sample 61220) suggests that remnants of relatively young rays from North Ray Crater may be overlain by mature soils ejected from small shallow craters. If this interpretation of the North Ray Crater soils is accepted, it is clearly distinguishable from soil interpreted as South Ray Crater ejecta, which contains dark brown to black vesicular glass droplets and dark gray breccias.&quot;
123:52:33||alsj|On <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16PP-D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">page 78</a> of the USGS Professional Paper, exposure ages of North Ray samples - and, presumably the age of the crater itself - are said to be in the range of 30 - 60 million years.
123:52:42||alsj|John reappears and sets the gnomon just west of the trench.  The color scale on the sunward leg is clearly visible.  He backs off-camera to the left to take cross-Sun pictures and Charlie backs off-camera to the right to get the down-Sun.
123:53:00||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun is AS16-109-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17801" target="new" target="alsj">17801</a>.  Big Muley is in the background.  John's cross-Sun &quot;befores&quot; are AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18409" target="new" target="alsj">18409</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18410" target="new" target="alsj">18410</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:53:11||alsj|Charlie skims the top centimeter or two off the surface west of the trench, pushing the scoop forward with his left hand.  He raises the scoop without touching it at all with  his right hand until the scoop handle is horizontal.
123:53:18||alsj|Now using his right hand to keep the scoop handle steady, Charlie turns to his left.
123:53:27|Duke|alsj|The bags kept breaking.  They hook on your camera; and they had a little ring.  And you try to pull one off and you'd get a couple.  And then, sometimes you'd be running along and they'd just flip off!  And then sometimes, the ring would pull out and all the bags would fall away.  They'd still be together, but they'd just be loose and I remember one time (during EVA-3) we ended up carrying them on the end of our little finger and using it that way.  The same thing had been reported on all the other missions: that the bags are just crappy and they fall off.
123:53:27||alsj|The following comes from the Apollo 16 Mission Report. &quot;The three screws which fasten the bag ring to the bracket plate had come out on one of the documented sample bag dispensers and consequently came apart when unstowed.  The three flat-headed stainless steel screws mate with threads in the aluminum rings (Fig <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-61.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-61</a>).  The heads are staked to the aluminum bracket plate.  Thread sealant materials are not permitted because of the possibility of lunar sample contamination.  The Apollo 17 dispensers will be re-inspected to assure proper staking of the screws and tightness of the threads in the aluminum ring.&quot;]
123:53:27||alsj|The Apollo 17 crew did not experience a repeat of this problem.
123:53:27||alsj|See also, the discussion at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1201239" target="new" target="alsj">120:12:39</a> covering the mechanism by which the dispensers were attached to the cameras.
123:53:27||alsj|John finally gets a bag ready and Charlie tilts the scoop up and shakes it a couple of times to get the soil to slide into the bag.
123:53:44||alsj|While John &quot;Z&quot;s the bag, Charlie takes a big jump backwards to get in position to take a sample of the white soil.  However, he then realizes that John has to get rid of bag 352 before they can bag another sample and steps over to John and presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
123:53:44||alsj|Charlie turns and hops back into his sampling position.  John works to get another bag off the dispenser.
123:53:44|Duke|alsj|We wasted a lot of time, here.  John got this sample; then I had to walk over and turn sideways to him and he had to drop it in my bag and then I had to go back and get another sample.  Our idea in training - and they never would approve - was the old shopping bag.
123:53:44||alsj|See the discussion at they have at Shadow Rock at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta13.html#1683352" target="new" target="alsj">168:33:52</a>.
123:53:44|Jones|alsj|So you'd talked about that ahead of time.
123:53:44|Duke|alsj|You know, with the straps.  And when you pick it up it closes up.  They didn't buy that idea; and we ended up taking the sample bags (meaning the SCBs) and running around the Moon and just putting them on the ground.  And we could open it up and put our own bags in, and that was really helpful when we sampled by ourselves.
123:53:44|Jones|alsj|There's a discussion of that at Shadow Rock.  I thought that was a spur of the moment discussion of yours about the grocery bag but you actually had talked about it before the flight?
123:53:44|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we talked about it.
123:54:08||alsj|While Charlie gets a one-handed sample from the bottom of the trench, John heads for the Rover with the bag dispenser.  As Charlie tries to raise the scoop, it apparently slips in his hand and the sample falls out.
123:54:21||alsj|With his back to the TV, Charlie digs a second trench just east of the first one.  It is a small trench, only about two scoop widths long.  John takes up a position to the right of Charlie.
123:54:41||alsj|This time, Charlie uses both hands to get the sample.  To get his right hand a foot or so down the scoop handle, Charlie has to lean relatively far to his right.
123:54:54||alsj|As Charlie gets the scoop in position for the pour, he jars it slightly and looses some of the sample.  He then gets the remainder in the bag.
123:55:13||alsj|John finishes sealing the bag and puts it in Charlie's SCB.
123:55:32||alsj|John starts around the north side of the trench to get the gnomon.
123:55:36||alsj|To get a locator with the Rover in the background, Charlie would have to go over the rim of Plum and down the crater wall a short way.
123:55:36||alsj|John decides to get an &quot;after&quot; before he moves the gnomon, stops, and then goes around the east side to get in position.  His &quot;after&quot; is AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18411" target="new" target="alsj">18411</a>.] </i></blockquote>
123:55:57||alsj|Charlie heads south along the rim of Plum while John grabs the gnomon.  Once John starts south, Fendell follows.  John walks past Big Muley but then stops for a moment to  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">adjust his cooling</a>.  Charlie is well ahead of John, doing the foot-to-foot, loping stride.
123:57:03||alsj|Making an adjustment for the brief stop Charlie made to describe the lineations, the trip from the trench to the boulder took about 51 seconds.  The circumferential distance is about 70 meters and Charlie's average speed was a leisurely 4.9 km/hr.
123:57:23||alsj|Charlie actually had potassium-fortified orange drink is his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bag</a> and is using &quot;water&quot; in a generic sense.
123:57:23||alsj|The boulder is about a meter across and sits on a high spot on the southwest rim.  While John examines the boulder from the south, Charlie hops around to the northeast side.]</i></blockquote>
123:57:40||alsj|John moves in to put the gnomon on top of the boulder and Charlie gets in position to take the down-Sun.
123:58:06||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17802" target="new" target="alsj">17802</a>.  John's cross-Sun stereopair is AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18412" target="new" target="alsj">18412</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18413" target="new" target="alsj">18413</a>.]
123:58:06|Duke|alsj|You know, it was really buried and covered.  Looking at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17802" target="new" target="alsj">17802</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18413" target="new" target="alsj">18413</a>, you can see it was covered with dust.  And it had fillets around it.  The regolith looks real deep here; you can see a couple of footprints - on one side any way - that's a couple of inches.  You know, we thought that rock had come in from somewhere and it had either come out of Flag and then was covered with dust from a more recent cratering event, perhaps even South Ray.  Or it was sort of a bedrock; it looks like it's a sort of bigger rock that's been there for a while.  So we don't really know.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
123:58:11||alsj|Charlie's picture of the white material John kicked up is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17803" target="new" target="alsj">17803</a>.]
123:58:11||alsj|John sticks his right foot out in front of him and leans down to get the hammer from his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.  Charlie runs off-camera to the right, going around the rock so he can get a picture of John with the Rover in the background.]</i></blockquote>
123:58:11|Jones|alsj|I take it John was looking forward to using the hammer.&quot;]
123:58:11|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  In training, every time we got to a rock he'd whack it.  He was really excited about using the hammer when we got to the Moon, 'cause he'd used it a lot in training, whacking off chunks of rock.&quot;]
123:58:11||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S71-59355.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S71-59355</a> shows John (right) and Charlie during a November 17/18, 1971 field exercise in the Coho Range at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station in California.  While Charlie examines a boulder, John waits to step in with the geology hammer.]
123:58:11|Jones|alsj|And he got pretty good at it?
123:58:11|Duke|alsj|Pretty good, yeah.  Actually, it was pretty hard to hammer.  The core tubes, I ended up doing a lot hammering; and I ended up having to go two hands because it got real tired as you held that hammer and tried to hit; you'd get cramps and weaker in the forearm.  At least I would.  So I'd end up, a lot of times, hammering - at least core tubes - with two hands.&quot;]
123:58:11||alsj|As John walks to the rock, Charlie takes AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17804" target="new" target="alsj">17804</a>.  Note that John has both his upper visor and his side visors extended. When he gets in position, he sticks his left leg out to the side, and bends his right knee so that he can get low enough to hit the rock.]</i></blockquote>
123:58:58||alsj|John delivers a firm blow to a corner of the boulder and appears to break a piece loose.  He then taps the area of the break a couple of times, apparently to dislodge the fragment.  He stands for a moment and changes his grip.  He was down in the bent-knee position for about 5 seconds. ]</i></blockquote>
123:58:59||alsj|Charlie takes a couple of steps toward the boulder and puts his hand on John's left shoulder to help him get his knees bent.  John appears to press the hammer blade in the fracture and then pulls the fragment loose.]</i></blockquote>
123:59:05||alsj|John backs away and puts the hammer in his shin pocket.  Close examination of the TV suggests that John doesn't get the head as far into the pocket as it was originally, probably because the RCU and camera block his view.
123:59:05|Jones|alsj|In this sequence, you guys look fairly confident in backing up and going sideways.&quot;]
123:59:05|Duke|alsj|The only time you didn't want to back up too much was when you were unsure where you were and you could back into a crater.  You know, it was real easy to move - forward, backward, sideways.&quot;]
123:59:05||alsj|Charlie reaches forward, plants the scoop head about 1.5 meters ahead of his feet, and then sinks to his knees.  Initially, he has his back aligned vertically but is unable to reach the fragment.  He moves himself about 30  cm to his right, leans forward until his back is about 30 degrees off vertical, and grabs the fragment with his right hand without trouble.
123:59:22||alsj|Charlie grabs the fragment and rises without difficulty, not having moved the scoop head at all. The sample is 61295, a 0.2 kg breccia.
123:59:29||alsj|John steps forward with a sample bag and examines the fragment that Charlie is still holding.]</i></blockquote>
124:00:05||alsj|John takes the fragment for closer examination and turns it.
124:00:17||alsj|John puts the fragment in the bag and then, holding one of the tabs in either hand, spins the bag to close it.
124:00:45||alsj|John puts bag 353 in Charlie's SCB.
124:00:45||alsj|In Houston, Experiments and the Flight Director are trying to decide if there will be time to do an LPM (Lunar Portable Magnetometer) measurement before John and Charlie have to leave for Station 2.]</i></blockquote>
124:01:02||alsj|John hops to his left to take an &quot;after&quot;, AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18414" target="new" target="alsj">18414</a>.  The fragment came off the front face, between us and the gray/color scale leg on the gnomon.]</i></blockquote>
124:01:09||alsj|Charlie holds the scoop horizontally at waist height while he waits for John to get a sample bag out.]</i></blockquote>
124:01:19|Jones|alsj|Did any of the geologists spend time with you on how to hit rocks?
124:01:19|Duke|alsj|No.  Not that I remember.  You just sort of...Being in engineering, you just knew it was going to break along the fracture pattern.&quot;]
124:01:19||alsj|John holds the bag low and Charlie starts the pour.  John would have had a much more difficult time getting the sample in the bag had Charlie held it up at waist height.  Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-72-H-100.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">72-H-100</a> show John and Charlie bagging a practice sample at the Cape.  In that case, John is using the tongs and Charlie is holding a sample bag at knee height.
124:01:39||alsj|Charlie hops backwards a short way and takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;, AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17805" target="new" target="alsj">17805</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:01:50||alsj|The proposed location of the second pan is indicated by the circled &quot;2&quot; on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp065.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-32</a>.  John puts bag 368 in Charlie's SCB.]</i></blockquote>
124:01:53||alsj|John takes up a position to Charlie's left, up on the rim just south of the boulder.  Charlie hops just off-screen to our left.]</i></blockquote>
124:02:21||alsj|John turns to face west and starts the pan.  This is Pan 5, marked with an 'A' in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#Sta1Map" target="new" target="alsj">Station 1 plan map</a>.
124:02:21||alsj|Fendell shifts his aim to the left and gets both John and Charlie in the TV picture.
124:02:21||alsj|Charlie puts his left foot out in front and leans over it to plant the scoop in the ground without otherwise disturbing the area he intends to photograph.]</i></blockquote>
124:02:21||alsj|Charlie takes AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17806" target="new" target="alsj">17806</a>.

124:02:46||alsj|Charlie hops to his right and takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17807" target="new" target="alsj">17807</a> to complete the stereopair.
124:02:46||alsj|Charlie looks over at John, who is above him, taking a pan frame toward the north.]</i></blockquote>
124:03:08||alsj|Unfortunately, Charlie did not take a picture.
124:03:12||alsj|John continues the pan and, as he turns in Charlie's direction, Charlie raises his right hand to waist height in greeting.  This is frame AS16-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18423" target="new" target="alsj">18423</a>.]</i></blockquote>
124:03:12||alsj|Charlie grabs the scoop and runs south.  Fendell follows.  As we lose sight of John, the hammer is still in his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a> but seems to be sticking out farther and handing somewhat precariously.]
124:03:12||alsj|Charlie probably starts moving at about the time John takes AS16-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18426" target="new" target="alsj">18426</a>.  Apparently, John turned for the next shot and then waited until Charlie was in the field-of-view before taking <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18427" target="new" target="alsj">18427</a>.
124:03:12||alsj|Ken Glover notes that, in 18427, Charlie's SCB seems to be &quot;bulging with samples&quot;. Up to this time, they have put thirteen sample bags in Charlie's SCB.  During EVA-2, at Station 6 after they put eleven sample bags in Charlie's SCB, John comments that it's &quot;almost full&quot;
124:03:50||alsj|Charlie stops and turns to face back toward the boulder.]</i></blockquote>
124:04:08||alsj|Charlie means that the scoop, which he plants, will serve as a gnomon.]</i></blockquote>
124:04:15||alsj|Charlie backs away to the south to take AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17808" target="new" target="alsj">17808</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17809" target="new" target="alsj">17809</a>, stepping to his right between frames.]</i></blockquote>
124:04:29||alsj|Charlie moves to his left and takes a locator across the top of the scoop toward the Rover.  This is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17810" target="new" target="alsj">17810</a>.]
124:04:29|Jones|alsj|One of the interesting things about this picture is that you probably don't have more than a couple of inches of the blade stuck in.&quot;]
124:04:29|Duke|alsj|That's right.  I didn't stick it in too much, because that's all it'd take to stand it up; you didn't have to pound it all the way in.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:04:41||alsj|John comes into view as Charlie goes to his knees, once again using the scoop to keep his balance.]
124:04:41||alsj|The hammer has fallen out of John's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a> by this time.
124:04:48||alsj|Charlie rises, balancing the sample on his right hand.]</i></blockquote>
124:04:57||alsj|John presents his SCB.
124:04:57||alsj|This sample is 61015, a 1.8 kilogram &quot;partially molten breccia&quot;.  Charlie struggles for a moment to open the top of John's SCB with his left hand.
124:05:23||alsj|Charlie has pulled John's SCB loose.
124:05:33|Duke|alsj|The top of the SCB had a metal frame around it (as shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy99.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 99</a> - NASA photo S88-52671 - in Judy Allton's Apollo Tool Book).  And the top had a metal frame that just wedged over.  And it was tough to break the friction fit.  You just had to pull it off; and it was difficult.
124:05:33|Jones|alsj|Sort of like a lid on a plastic food container.
124:05:33|Duke|alsj|Exactly.
124:05:33||alsj|Charlie takes the SCB completely off John's PLSS and puts the sample in. He then examines the bag and tries to re-attach it.
124:06:12||alsj|John takes the SCB from Charlie.
124:06:14||alsj|John bends sideways to pick up the gnomon and Charlie grabs the scoop.  They head for the Rover.
124:06:26||alsj|John's veers to his left, headed toward the boulder.]</i></blockquote>
124:06:32||alsj|John stops part way back to the boulder.
124:06:32||alsj|Once again, Charlie uses the scoop to get down on his knees.]</i></blockquote>
124:06:51||alsj|Charlie rises and gives the hammer to John.  John has trouble getting the hammer in his pocket.]
124:06:51||alsj|In Houston, the Backroom tells the Flight Director that they want John and Charlie to collect Big Muley.
124:06:58||alsj|Once John gets the hammer in his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>, Charlie turns and heads around the rim of Plum.  After a few seconds, John  follows.]</i></blockquote>
124:07:28||alsj|Charlie is making good speed using the loping, foot-to-foot stride.
124:07:52||alsj|Great Scott is a 9.6 kg basalt that Dave Scott collected at the edge of Hadley Rille.  At the time, it was the largest Apollo sample, having surpassed a 9.0 kg Apollo 14 breccia known as Big Bertha.  Big Muley, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16BigMuley61016.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">sample 61016</a>  ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-41841.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">172k</a> ), is an 11.7 kg breccia with a dark matrix and light-colored clasts.  The largest Apollo 17 sample was 70215, an 8.1 kg basalt, so Big Muley retained the record.  NASA photos <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#S7241841" target="new" target="alsj">S72-41841</a> and  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#S7241550" target="new" target="alsj">S72-41550</a> are post-mission portraits of Big Muley.]</i></blockquote>
124:07:56||alsj|Charlie stands at rest, leaning slightly forward on the scoop while he waits for an answer.
124:08:05||alsj|With his left hand on the top of the scoop, Charlie drops to his knees and rolls Big Muley over against the front of his right leg.
124:08:13||alsj|Charlie can't get his hand low enough to get under the rock, so he uses the tips of his fingers to try to roll it up onto his thigh.  It falls off.  He then strains forward until he can get his hand curved around the rock far enough that he can, at least, press it against his leg and, finally, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.muley.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">he stands</a> (video still by Ken Glover).  Dave Scott used a similar technique when he  <a hef="../a15/a15.rille.html#1660900" target="new">collected Great Scott</a>
124:08:27||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop, gets his left hand under the camera and does a little jump so that the rock floats upward far enough that he can get a solid grip with both hands.  The Hasselblad is clearly getting in the way.
124:08:37||alsj|Bill Muehlberger is the Principal Investigator for Apollo 16 geology.  As is discussed at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1post.html#1271610" target="new" target="alsj">127:16:10</a>, Big Muley is named for him.
124:08:37|Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter and a 1997 e-mail message|alsj|Big Muley was a problem from the moment we saw it on TV. The crew had been told to pick up nothing larger than their fist - the lab types could analyze remarkably small pieces and get reproducible results.  So, when we spotted Big Muley with the television camera and saw what looked like a large rectangle flashing at us, we jumped to the conclusion that it was a crystal - or cleavage - face of plagioclase feldspar. That made the rock an anorthosite which, according to our pre-mission interpretations, should not be present at this landing site. Further, there was a small crater on our side (between the Rover and Big Muley) that we thought could be a bounce crater caused by this rock on landing. The direction suggested that this could have been from Theophilus, a large, relatively young  crater that had been proposed as a source for some material that might be scattered across the landing area.  So, I put in a request for the crew to pick it up as they returned to the LRV.  We had no idea of size  - it was the first sampling stop on the mission - but, once the crew got close, we realized that it was bigger than the max size suggested for return from the Moon  And then Charlie started complaining about it(s size) and about his struggle to pick it up.  It turned out to be the largest rock returned from the Moon!  And it turned out to be a useful rock for the researchers.
124:08:37||alsj|Charlie is now able to cradle the rock against his side with his right hand.  He grabs the scoop and heads for the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
124:08:39|Jones|alsj|That's a nice sequence there of you picking up Big Muley.  It didn't look like you had stability problems at all.
124:08:39|Duke|alsj|No, I was a little over the rim, down inside and so I was a little bit below the rock, which really helped.  When you could get below something, it really helped.  And then, of course, I was leaning on the shovel with my left hand.  And I was trying to roll it up my leg; but I never could get it up past the stuff down in here, which I think was part of the camera and stuff.  But I was able to hold it against myself.  You know, we really didn't particularly want to carry it, but they said bring it back.  'Cause it was a big rock; you know, we only had 200 pounds or so we needed to collect and it turned out, when we got back (in the LM) there was a big debate: maybe we'll have to throw something out.  But then they changed their mind.  But we weighed everything, you know, and we were over our limit.&quot;]
124:08:39||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and starts panning counter-clockwise.]</i></blockquote>
124:09:13||alsj|The TV jiggles slightly as they work around the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
124:09:40||alsj|Fendell finds John at the CDR seat, collapsing the gnomon legs into a slender bundle so he can stow it in the sleeve behind his seat. We get a good close-up of John's sample bags.]</i></blockquote>
124:09:57||alsj|This sample is 60095, a 47-gram piece of glass that Charlie collected at the drill site at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.deepcore.html#1215310" target="new" target="alsj">121:53:10</a> and showed to Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.thumper.html#1222542" target="new" target="alsj">122:25:42</a>.]
124:09:57||alsj|John stows the gnomon.
124:10:25||alsj|John puts his left hand on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> and tilts it so he can get a clear look at the oxygen gauge on the top.  As is shown in the accompanying figure, the gauge is recessed and is difficult to see.]</i></blockquote>
124:10:47||alsj|John puts his SCB under the CDR seat.  He then stands, flexes his shoulder back, possibly to change the position of the cables in the suit, and then rests for a moment and watches Charlie, who is off-camera at the LMP seat.
124:11:29||alsj|John moves his right hand back, then forward, and then back again to reach his  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">cooling control</a>.  This &quot;double wave&quot; is necessary to overcome the resistance of the suit cables.
124:11:42||alsj|John goes to the front of the Rover to turn the TV off.
124:11:49||alsj|TV off.
124:12:41|Duke|alsj|It really cinched you in there.  It had a good over center position and it was easy to operate.  And it had a big hook on it so you could just reach over and hook on the outside handle of your seat, which was real easy to do.  You really couldn't see it; you were working blind.  And, then, that big handle would give an over center lock and it really cinched you in there firm.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:14:31||alsj|Pre-mission planning assumed they would leave  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Flag Crater</a> at an EVA elapsed time of about 4+57.  The EVA started at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new" target="alsj">118:53:33</a> and, consequently, they are 5 hours 21 minutes into it and about 24 minutes behind schedule.  They had planned to make a 5-minute drive back to Spook and then a 56-minute stop.]</i></blockquote>
124:15:23||alsj|Although Houston is concerned about Charlie's use rate of PLSS feedwater, the fact that they are about a half-hour behind schedule is also a consideration.
124:15:55||alsj|Charlie does not take any photos during the drive back to Spook but does during the drive from Spook back to the LM.] </i></blockquote>
124:16:22|Jones|alsj|I'm afraid I'm a little too young to be absolutely certain who Barney Oldfield was.&quot;]
124:16:22|Duke|alsj|He was a great race car driver back in the 20s or so.  As a kid, I can remember everybody talked about Barney Oldfield.  I don't even think he was driving when I was a kid.&quot;]
124:16:22||alsj|Journal contributor Brian Lawrence supplied the following information.  &quot;Oldfield was born in 1878 and began driving for Henry Ford in 1902. Among other distinctions, he set a speed record of 131.275 mph over a measured mile at Daytona, Florida, in a German Blitzen Benz on March 16, 1910.  He competed in the Indianapolis 500 twice (1914 and 1916) and retired from racing in 1918.  Oldfield drove the Indy pace car in 1920 and 1922 and died in 1946.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:16:30||alsj|This is probably an inside joke, possibly a reference to John's ability to change jobs - from Rover driver to geologist and back - without a moment's pause.]</i></blockquote>
124:18:19||alsj|If, indeed, they are approaching Spook, they need to turn northeast to park the Rover at a point on the rim of Spook nearest Buster.  See the Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:18:32||alsj|As indicated below, they are probably northwest of Spook and south of Buster.  Charlie seems to be mistaking Buster for Spook.]</i></blockquote>
124:19:07||alsj|If they are 0.8 km from the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LM</a>, which is near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CB.1/80.6</a>, and have been following their outbound tracks, they are south of Buster near CA.7/76.6.]</i></blockquote>
124:19:34||alsj|Finally, they have it sorted out.
124:19:54||alsj|This readout puts them near  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CB.0/76.6</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:20:31||alsj|As shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp241.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 3.6.1-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, Cove is about 1 kilometer in diameter and about 2 kilometers southwest of Spook.  Cove was one of John's landmarks at pitchover.]</i></blockquote>
124:20:44||alsj|As is shown in the Descartes EVA-I, II 1 of 2 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a>, Red Rose is a 200-m crater which is 0.8 km south of Spook at BW.2/76.5.]</i></blockquote>
124:21:06||alsj|See the Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">map</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:21:31||alsj|This <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">readout</a> puts them near CA.9/76.6.  Figure 6-29 from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> shows their actual location, which is very close to the planned stopping place at CA.7/76.7.  Clearly, the Rover Nav system is still giving very small errors.

124:21:52||alsj|Charlie will take a pan from the rim of Spook as indicated by the circled &quot;1&quot; on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev124.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-24</a>. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev125.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-25</a> lists the planned tasks for both of them.]</i></blockquote>
124:22:02||alsj|Charlie's first guess is that John has pulled out his purge-valve locking pin, which is true.]</i></blockquote>
124:22:36||alsj|The purge-valve-pin problem is discussed following  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.debrief1.html#1284606" target="new" target="alsj">128:46:06</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:22:56||alsj|What Charlie is saying is that the blocky ejecta from Buster thins out as you move away from the rim and that none of it reaches the rim of Spook.]</i></blockquote>
124:23:03||alsj|TV on.  Smoky Mountain can be seen on the northern horizon with Kiva Crater on its flank.  As can be seen in Figure 6-4 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-4.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">648k</a> ) from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, Kiva is about 900 meters in diameter and is about 4 km from Station 2.
124:23:29||alsj|Charlie is probably taking his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17811-27" target="new" target="alsj">first Station 2 pan</a> , which consists of frames AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17811" target="new" target="alsj">17811</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17827" target="new" target="alsj">17827</a>.]

It may be 0.7 fiducials left and 1.3 up from center.  David Harland has assembled the portion of the pan showing <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.spook_pan.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Spook Crater</a> with Stone Mountain and the South Ray ejecta blanket in the background.  Spook has a diameter of 370 meters.]</i></blockquote>
124:23:38||alsj|That is, John hasn't yet pointed the high-gain antenna at Earth.  On 15, during a straight drive along smooth ground west of Station 9, Scott and Irwin left the TV on in an effort to give the folks back home a view from the Rover in motion.  That experiment did not succeed.
124:23:38||alsj|Fendell starts a clockwise pan.
124:24:11||alsj|Charlie goes past the TV, probably headed for the CDR seat.  John dusts the TV lens.
124:24:30||alsj|John now uses the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">big dustbrush</a> on the LCRU mirrors.  We get a good view of the top of his camera - including the &quot;CDR&quot; label.  John moves out of the way as he continues his dusting and we get a view toward the southeast into Spook.  Stone Mountain is in the background.
124:24:38||alsj|We have an unobstructed view toward South Ray Crater and the raised rim is visible even at the low resolution of the TV picture.  The rim diameter is about 700m and South Ray is about 6.3 km SSW of Station 2.]
124:24:38||alsj|In a few moments, Charlie will start a series of 500-mm pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater.
124:26:34||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and finds Charlie, who is getting the Hasselblad with the 500-mm lens out from under John's seat.  Charlie walks off-camera to the right and John comes into view, going to the back of the Rover to deploy the LPM.]

There is no viewfinder and the camera must be aimed by sighting along the top of the camera body and lens.
124:27:10||alsj|John is at the right rear of the Rover, behind the LMP seat.  He looks at his checklist and, after examining <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp069.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-34 and CDR-35</a>, turns the page to read <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp071.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-39</a> which lists detailed LPM procedures.]</i></blockquote>
124:27:22||alsj|John goes to his knees at the back of the Rover pulls some pins to release the LPM.  Once he has the sensor free, he stands up and pulls a supporting tripod out of a mount on the gate and then attaches the sensor to it.

124:28:40|Duke|tech|Let me talk about the 500-mm targets, John, just a little bit.  I took those of Stone and the only thing that was significant about Stone was these lineations that I described; and they trended southwest.  It looked as if they started at the east and gradually climbed upslope and over the ridges; and you could just follow them all around.  They did not follow any contour lines or any of the bench lines.  They seemed to transect all that stuff.  They were very closely spaced when I took the 500s.  But, later on, we looked back over there on each EVA and, as the Sun (elevation) changed, the spacing between those lineations changed.
124:28:40|Young|tech|Not only that.  When we got up on Stone Mountain, I didn't see any lineations.
124:28:40|Duke|tech|You couldn't see it.&quot;]
124:28:40|Young|tech|I don't know what that means; but they sure weren't there.&quot;]
124:28:40|Duke|tech|At Flag Crater, in the undisturbed regolith, you could see lineations that were mostly (oriented) northwest/southeast.  (See the dialog at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta1.html#1235633" target="new" target="alsj">123:56:33</a>.) It looked as if the regolith was loosely compacted and the particles were standing up and the lineations were formed by the Sun shining on these particles - creating little, slight shadows.  I think that's really what those little lineations are.  I took some pictures of that, (AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17806" target="new" target="alsj">17806</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17807" target="new" target="alsj">17807</a>).  I hope it'll show.  That was the feeling I got.  If you just kick dust over it, it'd mask it and be gone.  I think maybe those things up on the mountains were the same kind of feature, but on a more gross scale.&quot;]
124:28:40|Young|tech|On Hadley Rille (Meaning Mt. Hadley at the Apollo 15 site), it might have been.&quot;]

124:28:40|Duke|tech|The 500 worked great.  It was a little bit more difficult to stabilize it than I thought.  I used the ring sight and fired off the pictures.  We could see into Stubby and we could see into the southeast wall of Stubby.  You could not see the apparent flow that is on the (pre-mission) photograph.  It was not apparent to me, looking at it, I thought.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:28:53||alsj|The sensor falls off the tripod but John manages to catch the ribbon cable on his wrist and retrieves the sensor easily.  He finally gets it attached.
124:29:14||alsj|The power switch is on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LPM electronics box</a> which is mounted on the Rover behind the LMP seat.
124:29:20||alsj|A temperature label - or 'tempa-label' - is patch with a series of spots which change from white to black at successively higher temperatures.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.
124:29:26||alsj|John walks sideways as he moves away from the Rover.  The ribbon cable is wound on a double reel (lower right in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photo</a>) - with the sensor end of the cable emerging from one side and the Rover side emerging from the other.  After a few feet, John stops, puts the LPM down, and manipulates the cable, probably getting some twists out.]
124:29:26|Young|tech|Let me say something about the LPM.  The thing that surprised me was that there were no problems reading it in the Sun.  We also anticipated that it would be hard to wind up (based on Ed Mitchell's Apollo 14 experience with the instrument); but it was easy to wind up.  The problem was to unstow it.  After each deployment, it got harder and harder to pull loose and I thought on the last one that the cable might bust before we got it completely unwound.  Just shows, you never know what your problem is going to be up there.  It just got harder and harder to pull free.  But, it was easy to wind up and it's easy to set up and easy to operate and we'd probably have made a few more readings if anybody had been interested.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:29:46||alsj|With the cable now straightened, John moves away from the Rover, going in a northwesterly direction.  Fendell follows and we see the reel bouncing wildly at the middle of the lengthening cable.  As he gets near the end of the cable, he moves sideways toward the south.] </i></blockquote>
124:30:19||alsj|Charlie runs north toward Buster, starting with the foot-to-foot, loping stride and then switching to his distinctive, sideways hop.  He goes off-camera to the right.  John reaches the end of the LPM cable and sets the tripod on the ground.  As can be seen in Figure 6-29 in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, John is about 20 meters WNW of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
124:30:45||alsj|John orients the LPM relative to the Sun and then presses the legs into the surface to level it.
124:31:07||alsj|Fendell pans right to find Charlie.  Buster has a diameter of 90 meters.
124:31:07||alsj|Fendell zooms in on Charlie, who is standing on the south rim of Buster, obviously above the level of the Rover.    John's SCB is upright on the ground next to Charlie.  In the foreground, we can see the inbound Rover tracks; and, in background, a portion of the north rim of Buster.  We know this is the north rim of Buster - rather than the summit of Smoky Mountain, in part because of the visible rocks scattered on it. The Rover tracks indicate that John and Charlie drove nearly to the rim when they were trying to figure out which crater was Spook at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta2.html#1241923" target="new" target="alsj">124:19:23</a>.]</i></blockquote>
124:32:18||alsj|John crosses our field-of-view as he returns to the back of the Rover.  He needs to be well away from the instrument while the measurement is being made.  Consequently, the recording switch is mounted on the Rover.]
124:32:18||alsj|Charlie starts his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17828-36" target="new" target="alsj">left-to-right partial pan</a>, which consists of AS16-109-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17828" target="new" target="alsj">17828</a> to  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17836" target="new" target="alsj">17836</a>.]

124:32:37|Duke|tech|Buster was really an impressive crater.  We had some 3- to 5-meter blocks that covered 70 or 80 percent of the bottom of that crater.  And they trended up to the northeast slope and out the southeast slope of the crater.  There were large, meter-size blocks on the northeast rim.  Around on our side, the southeast side, we didn't have anything greater than half a meter.  I'm not sure Buster was a secondary crater.  If it was a secondary crater, it was really a big (piece of ejecta that hit), 'cause it was a big crater.  It was a primary crater and it had excavated into bedrock down there.
124:32:37||alsj|The following is taken from the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  &quot;Buster Crater appears to be too young to be a secondary from any primary crater in the region, with the possible exception of South Ray Crater.  Its relatively large size, compared to South Ray secondaries, and its long distance from South Ray Crater make a secondary origin for Buster Crater unlikely.  It is therefore interpreted to be a primary crater.&quot;]
124:32:37||alsj|Extensive studies of terrestrial and lunar impact craters - supported by the results of numerical simulations - indicate that the largest pieces of ejecta are derived from deep in the crater - where shock pressures are relatively low - and don't travel far beyond the crater rim.  Pieces flung out at high enough velocity to travel many crater diameters away are generally subject to high pressures and, consequently, tend to be smaller. Although the EVA-1 sampling area is liberally sprinkled with ejecta from both South Ray and North Ray, none of the pieces are anywhere near big enough to have dug a 90-m crater like Buster.  If Buster is a secondary, the projectile that dug it would have to have come from a far larger crater outside the local area.]</i></blockquote>
124:33:21||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop near the SCB and takes a stereopair of &quot;befores&quot; from the north. These are AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17837" target="new" target="alsj">17837</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17838" target="new" target="alsj">17838</a>.  In frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17838" target="new" target="alsj">17838</a>, note the rock just to the left and beyond the scoop.]
124:33:21|Young|tech|I think Charlie got some rocks from Buster Crater that came from the bottom.&quot;]
124:33:21|Duke|tech|The rocks were very similar to the ones that we saw at North Ray (during EVA-3).  We sampled rocks out of South Ray Crater up on Stone Mountain (during EVA-2), but the rocks down there (at Stone) looked very similar to the rocks up at North Ray and the rocks at Buster.  So, there could be some underlying formation that goes across the whole Cayley Plain.  That might prove to be totally wrong, but at least from a color inference, these black and whitish rocks were everywhere.  They were everywhere, I think.
124:33:21||alsj|&quot;The rock types you could classify as angular to subangular and with very little filleting around them.  There were some rocks from North Ray that had fillets developed, and I think that might be a way to tell one from another (that is, South Ray ejecta from North Ray ejecta).&quot;]
124:33:21|Young|tech|The rock from North Ray was a little more rounded and not as sharp (as one might expect if the North Ray impact pre-dated the South Ray impact).  We had rocks from North Ray and South Ray in the landing site (and you can probably tell them apart) only by the angularity and the (fact that the) old rocks have more zap craters and are rounded off.
124:33:21|Mattingly|tech|You are saying that those are North Ray rocks which had fillets?  That's a hypothesis.&quot;]
124:33:21|Young|tech|Yes.  That's a guess.  But I would say that is the best way to tell them apart.
124:33:21|Duke|tech|I bet you five bucks that's right.&quot;]
124:33:21|Mattingly|tech|I thought maybe you had traced them on the way up there (to North Ray).
124:33:21|Young|tech|Of course, some of them could have been from Buster, too.&quot;]
124:33:21||alsj|As indicated in USGS Professional Paper 1048, &quot;Geology of the Apollo 16 Area, Central Lunar Highlands&quot;, South Ray Crater is believed to be 1 to 4 million years old while North Ray is 30 to 50 million.]</i></blockquote>
124:33:57||alsj|The LPM consists of three fluxgate sensors, each of which is mounted at right angles to the other two.  The X, Y, and Z readouts correspond to the three sensors, respectively.
124:33:57||alsj|Charlie gets a sample bag off his camera.
124:34:06||alsj|John crosses the field-of view, headed back to the LPM to rotate the sensors 180 degrees horizontally.  In the background, Charlie grabs the scoop and raises it.  He doesn't yet have a sample and, hidden by his own shadow, is probably getting the top of the bag open enough to receive the rock he wants to collect.  After a few seconds, he steps his left foot forward, bends the knees, gets the scoop under the rock, and raises it.
124:34:06||alsj|Fendell pans left.
124:34:32||alsj|John lifts the sensor off the tripod and manipulates it.]</i></blockquote>
124:34:54||alsj|These samples are 62230-38.  The big fragment is 62235, a 320-gram piece of igneous rock.  62236 and 37 and 60-gram anorthosites.  Anorthosites are white and give the lunar highlands their light coloration.]
124:34:54||alsj|Charlie's cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; is AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17839" target="new" target="alsj">17839</a>, which shows the rock noted previously in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17838" target="new" target="alsj">17838</a>.  Frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17840" target="new" target="alsj">17840</a> is a &quot;locator&quot;, showing John at the Rover.  Note the Rover tracks in the foreground, the magnetometer at the right, and Spook Crater in the background.]
124:34:54||alsj|John puts the sensor back on the tripod and, because the tripod had moved slightly, re-adjusts the level.
124:35:24||alsj|There is no notation related to John's visor in either the Station 2 checklist pages or on the LPM page, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp071.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-39</a>.  Just before the flight, John may have decided that he needed to have his visor up to be able to accurately read the light-emitting diodes on the LPM display.]</i></blockquote>
124:35:31||alsj|Having rotated the sensor block 180 degrees horizontally, John runs back to the Rover.  After a few start-up steps, he gets into a very long, loping stride.  Although Fendell tries to follow him, the TV moves too slowly to keep up.
124:35:47||alsj|The interval from the start of John's 18-m run to his &quot;Mark&quot; was just under 13 seconds.  The implied average speed is at least 5.0 km/s and, clearly, his sprint speed during the middle of the run was far higher.]</i></blockquote>
124:35:56||alsj|Fendell zooms in on Charlie, who is slightly beyond and below the Buster rim, apparently taking a &quot;before&quot; picture of a second sample.  Note that the SCB is tilted slightly to the right, having been moved when Charlie put in bag 5.  The &quot;before&quot; is AS16-109-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17841" target="new" target="alsj">17841</a> and is similar to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17840" target="new" target="alsj">17840</a>.]
124:35:56|Duke|alsj|In  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17841" target="new" target="alsj">17841</a>, you can see where we were coming east and we turned and went south and parked down near Spook.  And these were the rocks (meaning the samples)...When you uncovered them they were the real friable ones, the white matrix that I called the shock rocks.  Most of the surface is unconsolidated regolith.  It looks real soft but, as you step in it, you don't make too deep a footprint.  There's a footprint in the lower right  that's probably a couple of centimeters deep.  And we just used the shovel to give us sort of scale and a vertical.&quot;]
124:35:56|Jones|alsj|And a shadow as well.
124:36:15||alsj|Off-camera, John takes two &quot;locators&quot;.  The first is AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18433" target="new" target="alsj">18433</a> taken across the back of the Rover.]
124:36:15|Duke|alsj|The gate on the back of the Rover is open and you can see the penetrometer and the two tongs, the rake.  I've got the shovel along with me.  And you can see the wire going out as part of the LPM.  And he's basically looking directly west, there.  And Buster's back off to the right.  We didn't use the tongs too much.&quot;]
124:36:15||alsj|Next, John takes  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18434" target="new" target="alsj">18434</a> across the seats.  Although the picture is out of focus, note the vertical member of the gnomon sticking up out of the stowage pouch behind John's seat.]
124:36:15||alsj|Fendell aims the TV down at the inbound Rover tracks and then moves his aim to the left to image a second section of track.  He then raises his aim as Charlie grabs the scoop to get the next sample.
124:36:20||alsj|Charlie gets a one-handed soil sample and, with the end of the handle in his left hand, raises the scoop, and gets his arms far enough apart that he can pour some of the soil in the bag he is holding in his right hand.  He spills some.
124:36:33||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop and then spins the bag before folding the tabs across the top.]</i></blockquote>
124:36:43||alsj|Charlie steps over the SCB, picks it up by the top, and puts in sample bag 6.  He then sidesteps until he is north of the scoop and takes an out-of-focus &quot;after&quot; of the soil sample, AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17842" target="new" target="alsj">17842</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:37:07||alsj|Charlie sidesteps to his left and puts the SCB down.  Fendell follows to keep him centered and we see John at the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
124:37:27||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop, backs away to the north, and takes a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;befores&quot; of the next sample. These pictures are AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17843" target="new" target="alsj">17843</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17844" target="new" target="alsj">17844</a>. Charlie steps to his right between them.]</i></blockquote>
124:37:58||alsj|Charlie tries to slide the scoop under the sample but only manages to push it along the surface toward the SCB.]</i></blockquote>
124:37:59||alsj|John will now rotate the sensor head 180 degrees vertically.]</i></blockquote>
124:38:03||alsj|John crosses the field-of-view and Fendell follows.  Just before we lose sight of Charlie, he gets the rock on the scoop head and raises it.]</i></blockquote>
124:38:20||alsj|This is sample 62255, a 1.2 kg anorthosite.]</i></blockquote>
124:38:27||alsj|Fendell finds John as he removes the LPM sensor head and turns it.
124:38:30||alsj|John re-seats the sensor head and adjusts the level.]</i></blockquote>
124:38:50||alsj|John runs back to the Rover.  This time, Fendell leads John enough that we see most of the run and, with the help of John's shadow, can time the end of it with reasonable accuracy.  The 18-m run takes 11.5 seconds and John's average speed is 5.6 km/hr.
124:38:50||alsj|Off-camera, Charlie's &quot;befores&quot; of the next sample are AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17845" target="new" target="alsj">17845</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17846" target="new" target="alsj">17846</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:39:06||alsj|Tony is reminding John to give a mark when he starts the next LPM measurement.]</i></blockquote>
124:39:15||alsj|Fendell zooms in on Charlie, who is getting a sample bag off his camera.  He then gets the scoop and uses it to turn over a flat, hand-sized rock.  He gets the scoop under it but, as he tries to lift it, the rock falls off.  After a second failed attempt, he rolls the rock toward the SCB.]</i></blockquote>
124:40:00||alsj|Charlie has been holding the bag in his right hand and the scoop in his left.  He now transfers the bag to his left hand, leans down to get his right hand on the scoop about half way down the shaft and then runs forward as he lifts the rock with the scoop. The rock flies up off the scoop and Charlie runs forward to try to catch it.  He grabs at the rock with his outstretched right hand and manages to bat it up and to his left. He reaches out with his left hand, but his momentum forces him to overshoot and he only manages to bat the rock back to his right.  Once again, he almost catches it in his right hand but, finally, the rock falls off-camera to his right.]
124:40:00||alsj|Fendell pans left and, while John does the readings, Charlie gets the scoop under the rock, raises it, tosses it up, steps forward, grabs at it with his right hand and pulls it in against his shoulder.  Finally, as he clutches the rock, the sample bag in his left hand falls to the ground.]</i></blockquote>
124:40:13||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop, transfers the rock to his left hand, and shakes his right hand vigorously to get the dust off.]</i></blockquote>
124:40:42||alsj|Charlie has the rock in his right hand, again, and has it up close to his faceplate as he examines it.]</i></blockquote>
124:40:42||alsj|Charlie reaches for another bag but pulls the whole dispenser off.  It falls to the ground.]</i></blockquote>
124:40:52||alsj|This sample is 62275, a 0.43 kg anorthosite.
124:40:52||alsj|Fendell pans left to watch John as he goes out to retrieve the LPM.]</i></blockquote>
124:41:09||alsj|John starts toward Charlie.
124:41:09|Duke|alsj|I asked John to come over because I had a rock in my hand and I couldn't lean down and...You know, you just ran out of hands.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:41:16||alsj|Part way out, John slows, reaches back, and  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">adjusts his cooling</a>.]</i></blockquote>
124:41:30||alsj|John slows again as he gets close and, as Charlie backs out of the way, John draws even with the dispenser, leans to his right, sticks his left foot forward, drops to his right knee, grabs the bag, and jumps back up with ease.
124:41:30||alsj|The run out to the sampling site took about 26 seconds.  As can be seen in figure 6-29 in the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the distance is about 14 meters and John's average speed is a very leisurely 1.9 km/hr.]</i></blockquote>
124:41:43||alsj|John hands the dispenser to Charlie and heads back to the LPM.  Fendell follows.
124:41:50||alsj|John slows as he approaches the LPM but the entire trip takes only about 19 seconds.  On this trip, his average speed is about 2.7 km/hr, which is the average speed assumed for walkbacks of more than one hour.]</i></blockquote>
124:42:12||alsj|John gathers the tripod legs in his left hand and runs back to the Rover, letting the cable train along behind.
124:42:15||alsj|John bounds very high as he runs back and, at one point, begins to get off balance.  In mid-air, he sticks his right hand out to the side to stop the rotation.  He then does the rest of the short trip to the Rover at a more sedate pace.  Although it is difficult to estimate how high he gets, it appears that his RCU rises about a half meter on the highest bounds.  During his longest stride, he is airborne for about 1.25 seconds. This figure suggests a maximum height of 0.32 meters and, if his forward speed was 5.5 km/hr or 1.5 m/s, a stride length of 1.9 meters.]</i></blockquote>
124:42:49||alsj|John goes to get the cable reel.
124:42:51||alsj|Without support, John drops to his knees, grabs the cable reel, and then jumps up.  When he retrieved Charlie's bag dispenser, he made a dynamic grab and wasn't motionless for more than a fraction of a second at the bottom.  Here, he stays down long enough that we can see the effort he has to make to keep from being pitched forward by the suit.]</i></blockquote>
124:43:05||alsj|There is a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">crank</a> on one side of the reel and John begins to wind up the LPM cable with his right hand.
124:43:14||alsj|Mitchell operated the LPM during Apollo 14, the only other mission on which it was deployed.
124:43:20||alsj|As the cable lifts off the ground, it jumps and snakes around.]</i></blockquote>
124:43:51||alsj|Once the LPM cable is completely off the ground, John walks toward the back of the Rover, continuing to wind as he goes.  He winds for a total of about 53 seconds.
124:43:51||alsj|In the background, Charlie is bagging a sample.  His &quot;befores&quot; of this sample are AS16-109- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17847" target="new" target="alsj">17847</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17848" target="new" target="alsj">17848</a>.  Readers should note that, because he isn't using the gnomon, he isn't taking any down-Suns, which are designed, primarily, to get the sample and the color/gray scale in the same picture.]</i></blockquote>
124:44:12||alsj|Standing next to the SCB, Charlie leans the scoop against his leg and spins the bag to close it.  This sample is 62295, a 0.25 kg igneous rock.
124:44:19||alsj|Fendell zooms in as Charlie drops bag 10 in the open SCB and grabs his scoop.]</i></blockquote>
124:44:26||alsj|John is probably talking about the LPM cable, rather than the geophone cable.]</i></blockquote>
124:44:35||alsj|Charlie gets a sample bag and collects a quick, left-handed soil sample.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have the sample bag completely open and, during the following exchange between John and Tony, brings his hands together to try to get it open and, in the process, loses the entire sample.
124:45:02||alsj|When John and Charlie first arrived at this station, Houston told them that it was going to be a 19-minute stop.  They have already been here about 24 minutes and, back in Houston, there has been an ongoing discussion about which tasks have to be completed back at the LM before the end of the EVA.]
124:45:02||alsj|Once Charlie gets the bag open, he gets another scoop of soil and bags it easily.]
124:45:02|Jones|alsj|Was the scoop you had the sort that had the little squeeze plates on the side and you could angle it?&quot;]
124:45:02|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh
124:45:02||alsj|Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy46.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">46</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy47.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">47</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Book show the Large, Adjustable-Angle Scoop that was flown on Apollo 16 and 17.  A smaller version was flown on Apollo 15.]
124:45:02|Jones|alsj|It's interesting that Jack had a relatively easy time getting rocks solo and a terrible time getting soil; and you had a relatively easy time getting soil, most of the time.&quot;]
124:45:02|Duke|alsj|It didn't seem like it was any problem.  If I was real slow with it - you know, bringing it up...The problem is that you'd hit it, and the rock would be in there and it'd be hung up a little bit - half buried - and you'd break it loose and it would pop like that and up it would fly (as happened at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1244000" target="new" target="alsj">124:40:00</a>).  And that was really the problem.  But, with soil, you could just pick it up smooth, with one smooth motion.&quot;]
124:45:02|Jones|alsj|Looked to me like you might have the scoop head angled at about the 45-degree position.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:45:11||alsj|Charlie leans the scoop against his leg but decides it won't be stable and pushes it into the ground.  He then spins the bag once and &quot;Z&quot;s the tabs.]</i></blockquote>
124:45:25||alsj|Charlie hops back and drops bag 11 in the SCB]</i></blockquote>
124:45:30||alsj|Charlie grabs the scoop and hops sideway, probably to avoid a small crater hidden by an intervening rise, and heads toward the Rover.  Fendell follows and, as Charlie goes around to the CDR seat, we see John working at the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
124:46:02||alsj|Caliche is a calcium carbonate deposit usually associated with water deposition and, therefore, very unlikely in the dry lunar environment.]</i></blockquote>
124:46:12||alsj|Fendell pans right to follow John as he goes to the front of the Rover to turn the TV off.  Charlie is putting the full SCB under the CDR seat.]</i></blockquote>
124:46:18||alsj|TV off.
124:48:30||alsj|As is indicated in Figure 6-4 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-4.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">648k</a> ) in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 16 Preliminary Science Report</a>, they are about 800 meters west of the LM.

124:48:42||alsj|The traverse photos -  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-17849-62.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">17849 to 17862</a> - are presented as a strip.

124:48:42|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And you can see how it changes the albedo.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:49:01||alsj|Charlie's tone of voice in this transmission is that of someone who has just reached the top of a roller coaster and, on &quot;big crater&quot;, is about to plunge downward.  You can almost hear him grabbing for the handholds.]</i></blockquote>
124:50:19||alsj|Since they both probably have their gold-plated sun visors down, Charlie is probably referring to the hinged, opaque sun visor at the top of the face plate.
124:50:49||alsj|What John is saying is that, if Charlie were to reach for the switch, he would knock John's arm and displace the handcontroller to the left.]</i></blockquote>
124:50:06||alsj|In the following, John maneuvers to avoid a rock or, more likely, a deep, fresh crater.]</i></blockquote>
124:51:50|Jones|alsj|I take it that this was one of those occasions when you'd come up over a little rise and...&quot;]
124:51:50|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And there would be a rock or a boulder there or a crater that was more than we thought we could handle.  So John would have to steer around it.  And what we're describing, I think, is we were really moving - I guess about ten clicks or so - and it really got to bouncing on us.  That's what I was talking about on the 'yahoo!'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:52:18||alsj|The EVA-2 and EVA-3 traverses will take them south and north of the LM, respectively, and they won't have to do much down-Sun or Up-Sun driving.]</i></blockquote>
124:52:19||alsj|See the discussion following  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta1.html#1230243" target="new" target="alsj">123:02:43</a>.] </i></blockquote>
124:52:33||alsj|Charlie will get off the Rover and use the 16-mm camera to photograph John while he drives the Rover through some pre-planned maneuvers.  Details of the Grand Prix are given on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp075.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-36</a>.  Dave Scott drove a Grand Prix on Apollo 15 but, unfortunately, the 16-mm camera malfunctioned and Jim Irwin did not get any usable film.]</i></blockquote>
124:53:15||alsj|Charlie may be referring to the two-meter boulder at the ALSEP site.
124:54:43||alsj|Charlie has taken off his Hasselblad so it won't get in the way while he uses the 16-mm camera. The Data Acquisition Camera (DAC) has a bracket mounted on the back which would allow Charlie to mount the camera on his Remote Control Unit (RCU).  Apollo 13 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a13/ap13-KSC-70PC-18.jpg"  title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-70PC-18</a> shows Fred Haise with a DAC mounted on his RCU.  The character of the 16-mm film that Charlie shot - reasonably steady with John well centered - suggests that Charlie held the camera in his hands.]</i></blockquote>
124:58:05||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-s72-37002.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-37002</a> is a frame from the 16-mm movie.  It shows John driving in an easterly direction, toward the LM, with Smoky Mountain on the horizon on the right side of the picture.  We can see the dust being thrown up by the wheels and can also see that the fenders are effective in keeping that dust from being thrown onto the vehicle.  Not counting the turn John made before coming back on the return leg, John drove about 25 seconds in each direction.  His average speed would ahve been less than 10 km/hr, so the distance he drove in each direction would have been less than 70 meters.
124:59:22||alsj|Each leg of John's second run as also about 25 seconds although, perhaps, his average speed was slower and he didn't go quite as far toward the LM.
124:59:32|Duke|tech|It was, to do that.&quot;]
124:59:32|Young|tech|I was driving around craters and a couple of times I did a breakout there on the turn to show them how it looked.  Driving the Rover, when it breaks out, is no problem. All you have to do is cut back (meaning steer into the slide) like you do in snow when the back-end breaks out.  The trouble is, when you cut back, you overshoot, and you may end up going the other way.  But, at least you're not going; you stop.  You're relatively slow when you break back the other way.  We never did...On a couple of breakouts, when we were in a hurry - and we may have had three (breakouts) during the whole time - the thing changed direction as much as 90 degrees; and then (I) cut back into it (and) we ended going back this (opposite) way 100 degrees.  But (the important thing is that) the thing (meaning the Rover) would be stopped.  I never did have the feeling that we're going to turn over.  Although, one time we had a couple of wheels off the ground and went sideways.  I wasn't too impressed with that.&quot;]
124:59:32||alsj|I believe that what John was trying to say is that, on some of the breakouts, the back end would come around as much as 90 degrees - putting them on a heading at right angles to their original direction of travel - and then, as John steered into the slide, the front end came around through the original heading and overshot.  It is not clear if &quot;going back this way 100 degrees&quot; means they overshot by 10 degrees or 100. John's statement that &quot;you may end up going the other way&quot; suggests that the overshoot was 100 degrees or more.]
124:59:32|Duke|tech|One time I thought I was going to be under the thing.  That was on EVA-3 and we'll talk about that later.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
124:59:57|Duke|tech|I'd left the core tube standing on the little tripod (that is, leaning on the drill stem rack, which he did at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.thumper.html#1223056" target="new" target="alsj">122:30:56</a>).  I picked them up and ran back to the LM.  I didn't bother getting back on the LRV - just put them in the bag.  At first, they were a little bit too long for the bag and I couldn't get the Velcro down on the bag.  But, once we got them inside (the LM) and tamped it in, the snaps snapped and the Velcro Velcroed.  We brought those beauties back as advertised.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:00:23||alsj|Charlie switched to Aux water at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta1.html#1233150" target="new" target="alsj">123:31:50</a>.  See the discussion there.]</i></blockquote>
125:02:05||alsj|This is a reference to a surreptitious sampling stop Dave Scott made during the drive back to the LM at the end of the Apollo 15 EVA-1 traverse.  He told Houston that his seatbelt had come loose but, in reality, he stopped to collect a visually-striking piece of rock, now known as the Seatbelt Basalt.  See the dialog and discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.trvlm1.html#1234211" target="new" target="alsj">123:42:11</a> in the Apollo 15 Lunar Surface Journal.]</i></blockquote>
125:03:45|Young|tech|Arming of the mortar package at the end of EVA-1 was no problem.  That was a one-time item.  I have some misgivings about being able to deploy the mortar package on any amount of slope.  Fortunately, the place where the mortar package was sitting was almost level.  And, it was the only place around there that was.  If it had been touch (meaning consolidated) regolith like it was in a couple of places, we would never have gotten it in the ground.
125:06:44||alsj|To deploy the Solar Wind Collector, Charlie extends the staff and then pulls the collector down like a window shade and hooks it on the staff.  He then points the side of the collector labeled &quot;Sun&quot; at the Sun.]</i></blockquote>
125:07:31||alsj|This close to the spot where John initialized the Nav system, the bearing is meaningless.  The fact that the indicated range is 100 meters is consistent with the small errors they have had throughout the traverse.]</i></blockquote>
125:08:44||alsj|An exchange of e-mail with Tony England, Apollo 16 Geology P.I. Bill Muehlberger, and Apollo geologist George Ulrich produced the following explanation of this cryptic exchange.  Tony was pretty sure that &quot;FS&quot; was a joking reference to a geologic unit on a traverse map.
125:08:44|Ulrich|alsj|I agree with Tony that this is an in-joke about photogeologic labels applied to map units on one of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.html" target="new" target="alsj">field trips</a>.  The crew performed practice EVAs at selected geologic problem sites around the US &amp; Canada using maps made from aerial photos of those sites - maps intended to simulate the mission maps. So the geologists preparing field-trip maps tried to be objective, using mainly descriptive nomenclature - with some interpretation - to guide the crew in their exploration.  Specifically I remember a unit 'FS' that was applied to the Hawaiian traverses (in December 1971). When the crew examined an FS unit on wheels and on foot, they remarked that its symbol, representing 'Flow, Smooth', was not very appropriate.  This was an important lesson demonstrating that the perspective from aerial cameras can be deceiving when applied to the actual surface. From that time on, the term 'FS smooth' became shorthand for 'it isn't what we expected to find here, Houston'.&quot;]
125:08:44|Muehlberger|alsj|I remember that field exercise well because I had been completely fooled by the photo interpretation. It was a traverse along the divide along Mauna Loa (primarily) and Mauna Kea. The FS unit was coal black on the photos and I thought that it must be pahoehoe (a smooth form of lava) which was black when we walked around on it. It turned out to be an incredibly jagged aa flow. The spikes and jagged pieces put much of the flow into shadow - when seen from above - and thus its blackness. It just showed that photo-interpretation by itself is not much use without field checking.  Our pre-mission interpretations for both Apollo 16 and 17 had flaws that the crews corrected.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:08:50||alsj|The Genesis Rock was a piece of large-crystal anorthosite found by the Apollo 15 crew on the flank of Mt. Hadley Delta on Apollo 15.  The large crystal size indicates a rock formed at depth, presumably early in lunar history, which had survived relatively unscathed by subsequent impacts.  Because John and Charlie landed in the lunar highlands and, hence in old terrain, the discovery of at least a few pieces of &quot;crystalline rock&quot; was not unexpected.
125:08:50||alsj|This sample is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LunarSampleCompendium60015.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">60015</a>, a 5.6 kg piece of &quot;cataclastic anorthosite&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
125:10:56||alsj|Charlie's camera is loaded with B&amp;W film and, apparently, he had planned to use John's camera to photograph the Solar Wind with color film.  There is, however, no mention of this on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev129.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-29</a>.]</i></blockquote>

125:12:16||alsj|Various piece of equipment have sets of temeprature sensitive labels attached.  At a particular temperature, some of the labels will be white and the others will have changed to black, thus making a coarsely-graded thermometer.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.
125:13:37||alsj|In Houston, there is an ongoing discussion about putting Charlie's SCB-5 in the rock box instead of John's SCB-1.  Apparently, SCB-1 was &quot;clean&quot; (probably meaning it had flown to the Moon in the rock box and was known to be sterile), while SCB-5 was not.  On the other hand, SCB-5 contains most of the soil samples from this EVA and the Backroom would liked to keep those under vacuum conditions in the rock box.  In the end, Jim Lovell, the spokesman for the Backroom, tells the Flight Director that they want the contents of SCB-5 in the rock box.
125:13:37||alsj|TV on.
125:13:58||alsj|Charlie has been working at the MESA and comes to the Rover carrying SCB-1, which is now empty.
125:14:37||alsj|Charlie turns slightly to present his SCB.  John comes over and goes to his knees to release the fasteners at the bottom.  After a few seconds, he hops up.
125:14:39||alsj|John lifts SCB-5 off Charlie's PLSS and, on the side that was against the PLSS we see a metal band which fit over two upturned metal tabs on side of Charlie's PLSS.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-62.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-62</a> from the Apollo 16 Mission Report.
125:15:03||alsj|John gives SCB-5 to Charlie and goes off-camera to the left.  Charlie heads for the MESA and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pans left.
125:15:10||alsj|The alternative is to put the entire SCB in the rock box and, obviously, that takes up more room.  In addition, by pouring the individual sample bags in, Charlie can fill the corners in the box more effectively.
125:15:10||alsj|John comes into view with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> and starts cleaning the front of the Rover as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp077.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-40</a>.  A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16brush.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC71PC777" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71PC-777</a> shows the dustbrush stowed on the front of the training Rover.] </i></blockquote>
125:15:10||alsj|After cleaning the TCU (Television Control Unit) mirror, John uses the dustbrush on the TV lens.
125:15:52||alsj|John goes off-camera to the left to stow the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> on its bracket on the high-gain antenna.  Fendell resumes his counter-clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
125:17:04|Young|tech|It was just before ingress when we reset the (UV) camera (and) that son-of-a-gun really was hard to turn in azimuth; and I didn't think I was going to be able to turn it.
125:17:04||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.  Although we can see most of the LM shadow, John is probably just off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>
125:18:02|Young|tech|To move the camera in azimuth completely destroyed any leveling.  As the mission went on, to move the camera in azimuth got harder and harder and, finally, it got so hard that, every time you moved it, it would pick the camera up off the ground and destroy the level.  I had to re-level it after every setting and that took a lot of time.  And, in some cases, because we were really in a hurry, I didn't get the level where I would have like to have had it, as far as being perfectly level.  Adjusting the level, using the wheels, just couldn't compensate for both the slope and picking the thing up every time.  From that standpoint, it was pretty bad.
125:18:02||alsj|&quot;There was something wrong with the azimuth; it just got stickier and stickier.  It didn't work at all like on the training model or either qual model.  I don't know what it could have been.  But, I would devote a reasonable amount of time to leveling the camera after each setting.  I think we have probably devoted three to four times as much time as we'd allotted for each setting.  I got behind doing that.&quot;] </i></blockquote>
125:19:04||alsj|There is no mention of the cosmic ray experiment on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev129.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-29</a> and, after the trouble John had with it at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.alsepoff.html#1203845" target="new" target="alsj">120:38:45</a>, he may have left it in the wrong place.]
125:19:04||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie carrying the 16-mm camera from the MESA to the LMP seat.
125:19:30||alsj|The soil samples will be analyzed for volatile content, meaning the type and quantity of constituents that can be driven off with the application of heat and collected as gasses.
125:19:30||alsj|Fendell completes the clockwise pan and, as he looks over the top of the console, we watch Charlie securing the 16-mm camera on his inboard handhold.
125:19:42||alsj|John is doing something with the cosmic ray experiment.  Fendell pans counter-clockwise.
125:19:42|Jones|alsj|It looks like there's quite a bit of rock close to the LM.&quot;]
125:19:42|Duke|alsj|Yeah, scattered around.  (At 119:39:33), I had estimated it, you know, 20 to 30 percent, and it's just not that much.&quot;]
125:19:42|Jones|alsj|But a lot more than there were out, say, at Flag.&quot;]
125:19:42|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I think we were on a ray, here.&quot;]
125:19:42|Jones|alsj|It's striking.  It's dramatically higher concentration than around the 15 or 17 landing sites, because of the ray.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:20:27||alsj|I have been unable to find these cosmic ray procedures in the checklists.
125:20:27||alsj|Fendell stops the pan to look at the U.S. Flag and then pans up and slightly left to find the Rover high-gain antenna.]</i></blockquote>
125:21:20||alsj|Once Fendell finds the high-gain antenna, he pans up along the right edge until he finds Earth.
125:21:43||alsj|Fendell zooms in on Earth and, at maximum zoom, it covers about one quarter of the horizontal width of the field-of-view.  The Earth's angular diameter from the Moon is about 2 degrees and, consequently, the field-of-view is about 8 degrees wide.  A bit more than half of the disk of the Earth is in shadow and, on the sunlit portion, the blue of the oceans can be seen.]</i></blockquote>

125:22:18||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and lowers his aim.
125:22:29||alsj|As Houston realizes in a few moments, Charlie has mis-spoken.  He has been using magazine Golf.]</i></blockquote>
125:22:56||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp079.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-41</a>, John was supposed to load the cameras, magazines, and other gear into the ETB but, because of the UV camera, he is behind schedule.
125:22:56||alsj|After looking at the Solar Wind Collector for a few seconds, Fendell lowers his aim and examines the surface between the SWC and the Rover.  He then pans right, still looking at the surface near the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
125:22:56||alsj|John is taking photos of the UV camera.  The two down-Suns are AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18435" target="new" target="alsj">18435</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18436" target="new" target="alsj">18436</a>.] </i></blockquote>
125:24:08||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit, giving us a view of two empty SCBs in the LMP footpan.
125:24:08||alsj|&quot;Muley&quot; is, of course, sample 61016 ( <a href="http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/curator/lunar/lsc/index.htm" target="new" target="alsj">External Link</a> ) , which Charlie collected on the rim of Plum Crater.
125:24:19||alsj|If John stands too close to the UV camera and directly up-Sun, his shadow will fall on it.
125:24:31||alsj|John takes two down-Suns from 8 feet: AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18437" target="new" target="alsj">18437</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18438" target="new" target="alsj">18438</a>.]
125:24:31||alsj|Next, he takes  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18439" target="new" target="alsj">18439</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18440" target="new" target="alsj">18440</a>, which are interesting cross-Suns from the south, showing Charlie in the background with the Rover and the flag to the left.]
125:24:31||alsj|John's final frame,  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18441" target="new" target="alsj">18441</a>, is a picture toward the northwest across the LM shadow.]
125:24:31||alsj|David Harland has used 18439 to 18441 to create a  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.uvcam_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">mini-pan</a> and Dave Byrne has created an <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-18439-41.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">alternate version</a>.]
125:24:31||alsj|As Fendell raises his aim, Charlie returns to the LRV from the MESA and leans across his seat.  When he straightens up, he is holding Big Muley, sample 61016, which he holds up in sunlight in front of his faceplate and examines.]</i></blockquote>
125:24:31||alsj|Charlie carries the rock around the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
125:25:28||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the U.S. Flag that is painted on the side of the LM above the MESA.
125:25:55||alsj|As Fendell pulls back on the zoom, we see Charlie standing at the MESA with his back to us.  On the right side of the TV picture, a strap flaps around as John moves it out of the way.  This is probably the lanyard John used at the start of the EVA to lower the ETB from the porch.
125:26:24||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev110.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-10</a>, they had planned to take the EVA-1 pallet and the LiOH can up to the cabin after the Rover deployment early in the EVA. Because of the late landing, Houston decided to defer the task to the end of the EVA.  See the discussion and dialog following  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1201517" target="new" target="alsj">120:15:17</a>.  The pallet contains food, replacement batteries for the PLSSs and other gear.  According to the Final LM Stowage List, Apollo 16 carried a 10.5-pound (4.8-kg) 'food assembly' in  the LM ascent stage and two 4.6-pound (2.1-kg) 'food assemblies' in the descent stage.  One of the latter is in Pallet 1 and the other is in Pallet 2, which they will take up to the cabin at the end of EVA-2.]</i></blockquote>
125:26:25||alsj|Charlie peels back the thermal blanket on the right side of the MESA.  As can be seen in the TV, while the top of the blanket is white Beta cloth - like the outer surface of the suits - the bottom is gold-colored Mylar.  We can also see the Velcro strips that hold the blanket closed.
125:26:43||alsj|Charlie pulls the LiOH can out of the MESA and the blanket falls closed, having been disturbed when the MESA moved in response to Charlie's efforts.
125:26:54||alsj|Charlie gives the LiOH can to John.  It is a cylinder about a foot (1/3 meter) long and about a half foot in diameter.]</i></blockquote>
125:26:59||alsj|Although John is blocking our view, as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev129.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-29</a>, Charlie is probably putting the ETB in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> (west) footpad.]</i></blockquote>
125:27:13|Jones|alsj|I don't understand that line about 'can do it over the SRC'.  It sounds like you were a little concerned about getting the ETB in the dust?  Were you saying you were going to put the SRC under it?
125:27:13|Duke|alsj|No, I don't think so.  The SRC, at the time, is on the MESA table and I think I was talking about getting something out over the SRC, from inside the MESA.&quot;]
125:27:13|Jones|alsj|The pallet with the food and PLSS batteries.
125:27:13|Duke|alsj|Probably.  I don't remember.
125:27:13||alsj|I now believe that Charlie is probably talking about checking the pallet contents and looking at indicators - as per  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lmpev110.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-10</a> - to verify that the replacement batteries and LiOH cans for the PLSSs are good.]</i></blockquote>
125:27:17||alsj|Fendell starts to pan counter clockwise.
125:27:47||alsj|Fendell zooms in on Stone Mountain.
125:28:45||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and continues his counter-clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
125:29:50||alsj|In Houston, somebody asks Flight why Fendell isn't watching the crew.  Fendell responds that he wants to take a look at the LCRU mirrors and Flight suggests that, when he is done with that, he return his attention to John and Charlie.
125:29:50||alsj|Once the TV is pointed over the right front wheel, Fendell lowers his aim to look at the mirrors.  John comes into view, going around the left side of the Rover to get the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>.
125:30:12||alsj|The LCRU mirrors are covered.  At the top of the picture, John heads back to Charlie with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>.
125:30:31||alsj|Without raising his aim, Fendell pans clockwise.  At the right side of the picture, the TV's own shadow comes into view against the front of the right front fender.  For the next couple of minutes, Fendell scans back and forth across the LCRU mirror covers.]</i></blockquote>
125:32:16||alsj|Fendell is looking toward the left rear of the Rover and raises his aim to look at John.
125:32:20||alsj|John circles the dustbrush, trying to get in just the right position to bob down on his right knee.  He finally is ready and drops down, but he loses his balance and, for the first time, falls sideways.  As he falls, he gets himself turned so that he ends up on his hands and knees.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new" target="alsj">119:24:37</a>.
125:32:35||alsj|Charlie steps in to help John get up.  John pushes back with his hands and rotates his upper body backwards until he is balanced on his knees.  Charlie holds out his hand and John takes it as he stands.
125:32:45||alsj|John did manage to get the brush while he was down and now, after wiping it against his left hand, brushes his right leg.  He then starts brushing Charlie's right arm.
125:32:55||alsj|John taps the dustbrush with his hand, and then shakes the brush, in an effort to get it clean.
125:33:02||alsj|John brushes his own left forearm.  Charlie laughs when he hears Tony.
125:33:19||alsj|Charlie takes the brush and works on John's left hip.]</i></blockquote>
125:33:21||alsj|Here, Charlie is saying that John's strap-on thigh pocket is relatively clean.]
125:33:21||alsj|My thanks to Journal Contributor George Giusti, who successfully transcribed Charlie's &quot;I promise not to drop  it.&quot;  I had been unable to get more than &quot;I promise not to (garbled).&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:33:29||alsj|Charlie brushes John's stomach and then moves around to his right side.  John turns to accommodate him.
125:33:29|Jones|alsj|Can you say anything about the kind of force you could exert with the brush?
125:33:29|Duke|alsj|Not very much (force).  It tended to rotate in your hand.  You had a tough time getting a good grip on it.  And we found out, I think, later - I just went up there and pounded my arms on the ladder - or on the strut - and more fell off than any...It seemed like to me all we were doing was just dusting the dust into the pores of the suit.  We went through the motions; but you can see we didn't get much off.  And it took a lot of effort.  Holding anything real tight like that for long a time was really tiring.&quot;]
125:33:29|Jones|alsj|On the forearm, mostly?
125:33:29|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
125:33:38||alsj|Here, John is taking the opportunity to give Houston is overall impression of the site.  There has been pre-mission speculation that the landing site had been subject to relatively-recent volcanism and John's observation, plus the fact that virtually all of the rocks that they've seen have been breccias, is a clear indication that there hasn't been any recent volcanism around the LM or along the EVA-1 traverse route.
125:33:38||alsj|While John was talking, Charlie started working on the back of John's PLSS, starting at the top.
125:34:12||alsj|With the PLSS out of the way, Charlie brushes John's buttocks.]</i></blockquote>
125:34:21||alsj|Charlie holds the dustbrush up, offering it to John.
125:34:26||alsj|John brushes the back of Charlie's right arm.
125:34:27||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right.  John turns the brush so that the handle is up and goes off-camera to the right to stow it at the front of the Rover.  Fendell pans right.
125:34:58||alsj|Fendell finds John at the right front of the Rover.  The LCRU probably got dusty when John fell.
125:34:58||alsj|John uses the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> to clean the TV lens and then moves off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>
125:35:33||alsj|Fendell is looking at the SWC and the U.S. Flag, not having moved the TV camera since John cleaned the lens.
125:35:58||alsj|John moves into view and stands in front of the TV while he dusts the LCRU.
125:36:11||alsj|While John dusts, we get a good view of the flag windows on the top of his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a>.  See, also, training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC72PC140" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-72PC-140</a>.
125:36:39||alsj|John points the TV down-Sun and then tilts it down to look at the left front of the Rover.
125:36:54||alsj|John stows the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> on the LCRU and then kneels to turn the LCRU off.
125:37:14||alsj|TV off.
125:38:36||alsj|John is stowing Charlie's OPS antenna.
125:39:43|Duke|tech|During the ingress, I didn't feel stable enough to jump up on the ladder with the pallet in my hand.  I jumped up to the first rung and John handed it up to me and then I felt stable enough to go on up with that big pallet.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:40:41||alsj|We can hear Charlie's breathing as he gets in the LM.]</i></blockquote>
125:41:48|Duke|tech|You could stick the pallet inside and put it over against John's left-hand stowage area and I still had plenty of room to get in and take all the gear off of it and had the pallet back out.
125:41:48|Jones|alsj|What can you tell me about getting in?  If you had put stuff on the engine cover, would that have hindered either of you getting in?
125:41:48|Duke|alsj|No.  Uh-uh.  There was the ascent engine cover and there was a shelf (usually called the '<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new" target="alsj">midstep</a>').  The hatch was out here and you came in and you really bumped into the shelf and then the engine cover was back in here.  So you wiggled your way in and started (hand) walking up that little step.  And then you could use the Ascent engine cover to help you get on up.  But you never leaned back over the engine cover.  You were sort of wedged between the DSKY and the perch (midstep) or whatever it was called.
125:42:23|Young|tech|When we opened the battery covers, the dirt just flew up in the air and came right back down on the batteries.  We had to dust the batteries.  I could see why they got dusty.  There's hardly any way to avoid it.  That was on the first EVA, before we lost any fenders.  We were relatively free of dust in the front of the vehicle other than what we accumulated on the front of it as we drove.
125:42:23||alsj|Journal Contributor David Woods writes &quot;I had to smile at John Young's comment: 'When we opened the battery covers, the dirt just flew up in the air'. AIR! The conspiracy nuts will be using this as proof that Apollo was a fake. For myself, it just made me smile. :-) &quot;
125:42:23||alsj|Don McMillan has provided an animation ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../VLRV-covers.mov" target="new" target="alsj">0.8 Mb</a> ) of the battery covers on a his Virtual Rover being opened.
125:42:57|Jones|alsj|Can you tell me anything at all about those green pins.
125:42:57|Duke|alsj|It was something to do with whether they were any good or not.  Green was go and, if it was sitting on another color, you couldn't use 'em for some reason.
125:42:57||alsj|Charlie then looked in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a> summary.
125:42:57||alsj|Duke - (Reading) &quot;The primary had 5.2 pounds of LiOH and half a pound of activated charcoal and it was 41 man-hours at 520 Btu's per man-hour.  And the secondary canister had 3 pounds LiOH, 0.3 pounds of activated charcoal, and 18 man-hours at 520 Btu per man-hour.&quot;
125:42:57|Jones|alsj|And the secondaries - I think I remember - were the same cans that were used in the PLSS.&quot;]
125:42:57|Duke|alsj|Yeah; you're right.  Uh-huh.  It doesn't say anything about the pins.&quot;]
125:42:57||alsj|Charlie then found a description of the PLSS LiOH cans on page EMU-1 of the Apollo 16 &amp; 17 LM Systems Data Book.
125:42:57|Duke|alsj|This is a good schematics.  It describes the canister, here.  It's 3.12 to 3.38 pounds of LiOH; 9.4 hours at 1050 Btu/hr.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:43:08||alsj|It is not clear whether Charlie is talking about the food packages in the pallet or ones that were already in the LM.]
125:43:08|Duke|alsj|It looked like it wasn't (completely) vacuum packed.  You know, like a bag of peanuts on an airliner?  It was the same way.  The bags were just bulged.  Which means that they really weren't vacuum packed.&quot;]
125:43:08||alsj|David Woods writes, &quot;A small comment about the vacuum packed foods. I find it hard to imagine anything being packed on Earth that when exposed to the hard vacuum of the Moon wouldn't appear blown. At the very least, I would expect the food itself to begin outgassing in its container once its surroundings are depressurized.&quot;
125:43:08||alsj|See the dialog at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.debrief1.html#1284720" target="new" target="alsj">128:47:20</a> when Tony asks Charlie about the food packages, and Charlie replies that it was the overbag that had expanded.  The individual food packages had retained vacuum.
125:43:08||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-19887.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-19887</a> shows Apollo dietician Rita Rapp posing with some of the Apollo 16 food packages.  The package in the center foreground is labeled 'Day 4, Meal A'.  Details for that meal can be found in  the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM11Menu.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LM Menu</a> given in the Apollo 16 Press Kit ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_PressKit.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">5.6 Mb</a>  PDF ).
125:43:30|Jones|alsj|I was just noticing through here - as I've noticed in other places and in the other missions - that, when you're talking to each other, it's at one volume level and, when you're talking to Houston, you're talking louder.
125:43:30|Duke|alsj|That's typical.  You think you've got to shout to make them hear you.  No reason for that; that's just the way you do.&quot;]
125:43:30||alsj|Jones- &quot;It certainly makes it easy to understand who's being talked to.&quot;]
125:43:30|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
125:44:58||alsj|The UV camera is only 2 meters southwest of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> (ladder) footpad.]</i></blockquote>
125:45:20||alsj|John's statement may seem a bit ironic if one considers where he is and what he's doing.  Nonetheless, it underlines the fact that none of the Apollo astronauts took unnecessary risks.  When risk could be reduced by a cautious testing of the waters, the astronauts did so.  Then, once they were confident in what they were doing - whether it was landing the LM or climbing the ladder - they went ahead and did it.
125:45:20|Duke|tech|John looked real stable to me coming up the ladder with the bags in his hand - the rock bags and the SRCs.
125:45:20|Young|tech|The technique I used (is), I'd stand at the bottom of the ladder and bend down and spring and I could get up to the second rung of the ladder with either the SRC or an SCB in my hand.  That is really the way to fly.  You feel like Superman jumping up off the ground like that.
125:46:06|Duke|alsj|He was coming up one-handed with the SRC in one hand and you could rock off to one side.  So I was just telling him to be careful.
125:46:06|Young|tech|The way I would do it (meaning the equipment transfer) is, I'd put a bag on the LEC down at the end of the ladder, take the (other) bag in my hand and leap up the ladder, hand one of the bags to Charlie, and then pull up the LEC and hand the other bag to him.  That saved me a trip back down the ladder.  It was real easy to pull up the LEC.  You just lean against the ladder, do like this, and the thing would come up and then you'd grab it down a little further and you could pull it up in 3- or 4-foot grabs, even though the actual weight of something like the ETB was probably a good 30 (terrestrial) pounds with all the cameras and everything in it.&quot;]
125:46:06||alsj|John's description suggests that, at the top of the ladder, he took hold of the LEC with his left hand, pulled it up sharply and, then, as the LEC and the attached bag rose in the weak lunar gravity and reached the top of their trajectories, grabbed the LEC farther down.]
125:46:06|Young|tech|It was real easy and I'm glad we went to that LEC because, once we got (the length) adjusted, we never got any dirt in the cockpit from it - although we got so much other dirt, I don't know if it made a lot of difference.&quot;]
125:46:06||alsj|The early crews used a version of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-lec.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEC</a> which Neil Armstrong described as a &quot;Brooklyn clothesline&quot;.  The Commander would attach a bag or rock box to the LEC and move out from the bottom of the ladder to put tension on it.  Then, he or the LMP would reel the bag up into the cabin.  The trouble with the clothesline LEC was that it tended to pick up dirt and, as the crew pulled on it, the dust would fly off and coat both the Commander and the inside of the cabin.  On Apollo 14, Ed Mitchell carried some of the gear up the ladder by hand and, on Apollo 15, Dave Scott and Jim Irwin made minimal use of their clothesline LEC.  Pre-flight, John and Charlie decided that they would rather fly with a simple lanyard which, regrettably, retained the LEC designation.]
125:46:06|Young|tech|I guess the recommendation of the LEC is to put the (length) adjustment strap down at the bottom of it instead of at the top.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:46:38||alsj|John is asking Charlie if he can bend down far enough to get hold of the SRC.]
125:46:38|Jones|alsj|I gather you couldn't get your hand out to the porch, and  he'd have to put the rock box in through the hatch for you.  Is that right?&quot;]
125:46:38|Duke|alsj|I could reach down a little bit; and I think I was on John's side at this time.  So, yeah, I could lean down and reach out a little.&quot;]
125:46:38|Jones|alsj|So, if he stood it up on the porch...
125:46:38|Duke|alsj|I don't think I could reach all the way out to the porch.  No.  But he sort of shoved it in the hatch.&quot;]
125:46:38|Jones|alsj|Partway in the hatch.
125:46:38||alsj|The rock box was about 48 x 27 x 20 cm (18.9 x 10.6 x 7.9 inches).  If John slid the box in with the long-dimension parallel to the floor, Charlie would have to reach down to mid-calf.  If John pushed it in fully upright, the top of the box would be at about knee height.]</i></blockquote>
125:48:44||alsj|This is another reference to the comic book character, Superman.
125:50:32|Duke|alsj|They were bags for the bags; but I don't remember them.

125:50:46||alsj|John notices that, because the pallet and rock box have been removed from the MESA, the bottom of it is no longer touching the ground.
125:51:06||alsj|The longest EVA up to this point in Apollo is the second Apollo 15 EVA, which lasted 7 hours 12 minutes.  However, John and Charlie were out longer than the 6 hour 33 minute duration of the first Apollo 15 EVA.]</i></blockquote>
125:52:51||alsj|The MESA stowage diagram ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp025.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">145k</a> doesn't provide an immediate identification of the 'flag for the old whatchacallit'.
125:53:25||alsj|The UV camera decal, Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp448.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">5.3-1</a> in the Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, indicates that the planned target for the next sixteen hours is a cluster of galaxies known as NGC 134 at an azimuth of 230 degrees and an elevation of 53 degrees.  At  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1251633" target="new" target="alsj">125:16:33</a>, shortly after John arrived back at the LM, Houston had him point the UV camera at a target with an azimuth of 204 and an elevation of 26.  Readers should note that, unlike the Rover Nav system which uses north as zero azimuth, the UV camera uses west as zero azimuth. This can be confirmed by a comparison of the UV camera decal, Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp448.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">5.3-1</a> in the Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, with Table 2.3-1 in the same volume.  In the table, the Sun's azimuth is listed as 87-plus degrees at the originally planned start time for EVA-1; and, because the Sun is low in the eastern sky, this table uses north as zero azimuth.  In that same table, Earth is listed at an azimuth of about -41 and elevation of about 78.  That is, Earth is not far from the zenith and down from it to the northwest.  On the decal, Earth is listed at an azimuth of 54 degrees and an elevation of 77 degrees, and the difference in azimuth in the two sources is easily explained if the UV camera settings assume zero azimuth is west.]</i></blockquote>
125:53:58||alsj|Note that this is not the target (No. 4) indicated on the checklist.  Because the late landing, necessitated deploying the UV camera closer to the LM, the target list is being changed in real time.]</i></blockquote>
125:55:25||alsj|The LM is 7 meters tall and the horizontal distance from the footpad to the point on the ground directly under the front of the top surface is about 4.0 meters.  Consequently, if the UV camera were pointed directly at the LM, any target at an elevation of less than about 60 degrees would be blocked by the spacecraft.  However, because (1) the footpad is 4.7 meters from the spacecraft, (2) the UV camera is 2 meters southwest of the footpad, and (3) the horizontal radius of the Descent stage is about 2.2 meters, the LM blocks targets with azimuths roughly between 146 to 187 degrees - where zero azimuth is west in UV camera parlance.  Any target outside that range should be visible.]</i></blockquote>
125:55:48||alsj|Readers should note that an azimuth of 134 would leave the camera pointing in the general direction of the LMP window on the north side of the LM, confirming our conjecture that, with regard to UV camera settings only, zero azimuth is west.
125:57:42||alsj|AZ258 and EL64 do not correspond to any of the targets listed on the UV camera decal.  Because the lunar surface is so bright, he is probably not able to see any stars and, therefore, would not be commenting on his aim relative to the constellations.]
125:57:42|Young|tech|There's something else I don't really understand about the Far UV camera setup and the alignment that we're doing in real time.  Except for the geo-corona and the Earth (Target No. 2 on the decal), we changed every target in real time.  I don't understand that.  After doing it (in training) for months, we changed every target in real time.  There were at least two targets that they called up and we got the alignment with the tough azimuth change (because of a sticking rotation mechanism) and they were pointed right at the Lunar Module.  And, you know, when I turned the thing around, I was taking a nice picture of Charlie looking out the window.  In my opinion, that's an inexcusable waste of time on the Moon - doing that kind of thing, but we did it anyway.  I just can't believe we're doing that.  There was one setting, when we turned that son-of-a-gun around, and it wasn't even clearing the ladder good.  I don't understand that.  I'll never understand that; but that's what we did.  Golly!  Changed every setting after we practiced these things for months and we specifically reviewed them.  When we started all this business back about a year ago, about one out of four would be pointing at the Lunar Module and we'd say 'go back and research this, as we don't want to be taking pictures of the Lunar Module, surely'.  So they had them all changed; and I figured that, before we launched, we had them all down in real time and, by golly, if we didn't change every target.  I can't imagine that 6 hours (landing delay) could do that to you.
125:57:42||alsj|In fact, the film was not damaged and the experiment yielded useful data.]
125:57:42|Jones|alsj|Could you see stars out in the shadow?
125:57:42|Duke|alsj|No.  The only thing that was visible was the Sun and the Earth.  The UV camera was just looking up into the heavens all the time, to me; and I don't know what they were looking at.  We didn't take the time to dark adapt.
125:57:42||alsj|A related question is whether or not stellar images could have been captured in any of the lunar surface photography.  All of the photos taken out on the surface were taken at an exposure of 1/250th of a second at f/8 or f/11.  The two film types were SO 368 Ektachrome MS color-reversal film ASA 64 and 2485 black and white film, ASA 6000.  Sky and Telescope Senior Editor Dennis di Cicco states, &quot;Sirius and a few other bright stars might actually be bright enough to have recorded on the exposures, but the images would be impossibly small and hard to find on the original negatives. Furthermore, when such a negative was printed to show the foreground properly, it certainly would not have shown the star(s)&quot;  di Cicco notes that it would be easy to perform such an experiment on Earth.  &quot;Go out at night with a similar setup used for the lunar photos  and take a similar exposure of bright stars. Develop the film and see if you can find any star images. Then, have the negative printed with an exposure that would be proper for a normally exposed daylight negative. I am confident that you'll never, ever see a star on the print!&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:58:17||alsj|Although Charlie has gotten a warning tone indicating that he is just about out of cooling water, he will end the EVA with about a half pound left out of the original twelve pounds.  He is not working very hard at the moment and, if need be, could get hooked up to the LM system relatively quickly.
125:58:37||alsj|The Los Angeles Lakers professional basketball team was a top-ranked team of the time.
125:58:47||alsj|Charlie is standing behind the hatch and John is still out on the porch.
125:58:47|Jones|alsj|After you got everything in, you had to get over behind the hatch to let John in.
125:58:47|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And I was on the right (LMP) side at this point and I swing the hatch open so that he could get in, and that trapped me behind the hatch, and you couldn't bend down; and, at this point, John's still shoving stuff in.  I think he's got some sort of bags.  I forgot what it was - whether it was the ETB or whatever it is...But, anyway, something that's coming in with him; and I couldn't reach down and get it with the hatch fully open, so I had to open up so I could sort of lean over the hatch a little bit and bend at the knees to get down.  And, when I did that, I sort of closed the door.  John didn't mention anything but I just said, you know, 'I'm not closing you out'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
125:59:59||alsj|John has probably draped the LEC over the porch railing.]</i></blockquote>
126:01:15||alsj|After John crawled into the cabin and got his PLSS past the DSKY, he came upright on his knees, facing the left rear of the crew area.]</i></blockquote>
126:01:31|Jones|alsj|The way I understand it is that the sublimator wouldn't work if the hatch was closed.  On Apollo 12, Al Bean accidentally swung the door closed and there was enough of a pressure buildup from the water vapor coming off the sublimator that the sublimator quit working - although it certainly wasn't enough pressure to keep him from opening the hatch.&quot;]
126:01:31|Duke|alsj|The sublimator needed a vacuum.  We'd have to go on through here and look at the checklist.  (Pause)  We had to close our water before we shut the hatch...It had something to do with the sublimator problem or, like I said here, getting the water condensing inside.  Anyway, the whole object was to close the primary H2O on the PLSS and then close and lock the hatch.  Both <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../DumpValve.html" target="new" target="alsj">dump valves</a> in Auto, and then we'd hit cabin Repress, Auto.  Boy, you could hear it coming on, too, when that happened.   And I think we're going to comment about that later on.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:02:27||alsj|The feedwater shut-off valve is one of the three valves on the lower right rear corner of the PLSS.  Charlie is probably turning to his left to swing it around so John can reach it.]</i></blockquote>
126:02:49||alsj|As he did during the Depress, Charlie is using the overhead valve and probably can't see what John is doing with the hatch.  Charlie is left-handed, so it is relatively easy for him to reach up to get the valve, which is near the center of the ceiling.]</i></blockquote>
126:03:19||alsj|Once the cabin pressure goes above a few tenths of a psi, the hatch will seat itself.  After they depressurize the suits, they will be able to bend over much more easily to reach the latch.  The latch is really rather superfluous because, at 4.5 psi, the forward hatch would be impossible to open.
126:03:46||alsj|Charlie needs to turn around so he can get the valve on the front of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a> cabinet and then the circuit breaker on the panel on the right bulkhead.
126:03:50|Jones|alsj|You've got the Snoopy cap on inside the helmet.  Repress is pretty loud in the mike, although not terribly.  Could you hear it?
126:03:50|Duke|alsj|You could hear this, but it wasn't bad.
126:04:33||alsj|John is referring to the line 'PLSS O2 - OFF @ Cabin > 2.5 Psia', fourn lines above 109:25 in the righthand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a>.
126:05:19||alsj|The Caution and Warning System is telling them that the ECS is not properly configured - and that the warning system is working.
126:05:54||alsj|They have reached 109:25 in the righthand column of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 1</a>.
126:06:03||alsj|They are checking the circuit breakers to make sure none were bumped open or closed as they moved around with the PLSSs on.  As indicated on  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf1-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1-4 and 1-5</a>, they have four circuit breakers open which would be closed were they not trying to conserve power because of the late landing.  These open breakers are the S-Band Antenna near the left end of the top row on CB11, Mission Timer near the middle of the second row, LGC DSKY near the right end of the fourth row, and Inverter 2 near the middle of the bottom row on CB16.
126:06:44||alsj|It is a lot easier to get down to lock the hatch with the suits depressurized.
126:07:10|Jones|alsj|Do you remember anything about where the helmets were at various times?  The 17 guys had some sort of a web bag they put the helmets in.
126:07:10|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we did, too.  We had the helmet bags.  It was like a flying-helmet bag.  And then there was a webbing that we had.  And, I think, it was generally behind the ascent engine cover.
126:07:29||alsj|John's deflated suit may be pinching him.
126:08:34||alsj|NASA Public Affairs mentions to the media that Ken Mattingly is currently passing over the landing site.
126:08:34||alsj|Readers should note that the times used at this point in the Journal differ from the GET being used in Houston because of an 11 minute 48 second update made to the clocks in Houston at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.] </i></blockquote>
126:09:35|Young|tech|It was after EVA-1 that we noticed the wrist rings were getting clogged with dust.  There should be some way to cover those wrist rings - the things that snap in and out - to keep them from getting full of dust, because it (meaning the dust) makes them practically impossible to work.
126:09:39||alsj|Now that they have the gloves off, they will doff the helmets.
126:09:39|Young|tech|After EVA-1, we experienced a little stickiness with the helmets.  Not a great deal, so we didn't pay any attention to it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:10:46|Jones|alsj|This is the first time I've heard anybody comment on taste, rather than on smell.&quot;]
126:10:46|Duke|alsj|It was a little of both.  To me, it was more of a smell. It had that gunpowder odor to me.  I thought it might have been the ECS, you know, just coming up - with that oxygen in the lines.  But I think it really was the lunar dust.  It had to me a greasy (feel)...It really magnified your skin oils.  As you got it on, it felt like it was a real greasy feeling.  Oily dust.  But what I think it was, it was picking up your skin oils - because there is no moisture in the stuff.  And it did have that taste - to me, gunpowder - and a smell of gunpowder.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:11:12||alsj|They are now at the top of the lefthand column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 2</a>.
126:12:47||alsj|Charlie may be asking John if he got anything from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bag</a> during the EVA.
126:13:34|Jones|alsj|I had been visualizing just a bare pin falling out on the surface and was amazed that you saw it.  But the fact that's it's got that Red Apple on there means it was real easy to see.
126:13:34|Duke|alsj|And it was real easy to get to in an emergency.  Just pull the apple.  It was a biggie.  That's the only reason I saw it: because of the apple.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:14:01||alsj|John has probably gotten his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink valve</a> back into reach and has finally gotten a drink from it.
126:14:01||alsj|They may have dropped something.
126:15:14||alsj|Charlie is wondering why they have to connect the LM O2 and H2O hoses when, in about an hour and a half, they will doff the suits.  The only explanation that comes to mind is that there is a concern about them overheating while they do the PLSS O2 recharge, the PLSS/OPS doffing, and other tasks on the remainder of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 2</a>
126:15:45||alsj|Readers should note that the times used at this point in the Journal differ from the GET being used in Houston because of an 11 minute 48 second update made to the clocks in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.  Note also, that there seems to be an inconsistency in the times on either side of this long pause.]</i></blockquote>
126:18:03||alsj|John mis-read the instruction and should have said &quot;Audio: Commander and LMP; VHF A, Receive&quot;.] </i></blockquote>
126:18:28||alsj|To save power, they are not transmitting biomed data.]</i></blockquote>
126:18:35||alsj|Next, they will do a PLSS O2 recharge, starting with Charlie's PLSS. They are at the top of the middle column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 2</a>, PLSS O2 Recharge.]</i></blockquote>
126:19:18||alsj|APS is Ascent Propulsion System, which they will use for the return to orbit.]
126:19:18||alsj|I mentioned to Charlie that it was very unusual for the crew to be transmitting during this part of the mission.  He noted that, in the next to last paragraph in the lefthand column of They are at the top of the middle column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16EVA1Card2Side2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Card 2 Side 2</a>, they should have gone to &quot;Mode - ICS/PTT&quot;.  John did, indeed read that step out at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1261814" target="new" target="alsj">126:18:14</a>.]
126:19:18|Duke|alsj|ICS:PTT.  That meant, to transmit, you had to use the trigger, but we could talk between ourselves in that position.  Like you could have an intercom.  So, maybe we had the tape recorder running.  I don't know how this got out, actually.&quot;]
126:19:18|Jones|alsj|Well, Ed comes on here in a little bit and says you are hot-miked.&quot;]
126:19:18|Duke|alsj|Well, then John didn't put the switch where it was supposed to be - or I didn't.&quot;]
126:19:18|Jones|alsj|I was also curious about the 'cards' comment here at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1261920" target="new" target="alsj">126:19:20</a>.
126:19:18|Duke|alsj|Oh.  Well, he was going through this folder here.&quot;]
126:19:18||alsj|Charlie had a bag with him at the 1992 mission review; it was made of the same Beta-cloth material as the SCBs.
126:19:18|Duke|alsj|This is the one we had on board, and we had all our cards in here; and, so, he was going through 'em and one of 'em he just happened to pull out was the APS Card.  He was looking for something else.  See, here comes all the checklists and cards and he pulled out one, 'Okay, we're going to need that one.'  And that might have been the APS Burn card and that was something we were going to use later.&quot;]
126:19:18|Jones|alsj|Would you have put the Lunar Surface Checklist in there?&quot;]
126:19:18|Duke|alsj|I don't remember.  Could have.
126:19:18|Jones|alsj|And that bag was just basically to keep everything together and out of the way.&quot;]
126:19:18|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And it was a transfer bag.  We brought everything over (into the LM); this was all in the Command Module.  So we brought all that stuff over and, then, we Velcroed up what we needed.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:20:14|Jones|alsj|You were in down-voice backup because of the lack of steerable (antenna) and that wasn't push-to-talk.  Is that right?&quot;]
126:20:14|Duke|alsj|Right.  It gave you a hot-mike.
126:20:14||alsj|Charlie then looked at the 2 Comm diagram in the Apollo 16 &amp; 17 LM Systems Data Book.]
126:20:14|Duke|alsj|Looks like it goes right...(pause, looking at system diagrams)  It goes to the speech processor and right on out to the amplifiers.&quot;]
126:20:14|Jones|alsj|Without going through the triggers.
126:20:14|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
126:20:14|Jones|alsj|Although there are other instances of down-voice backup in other missions and I imagine that I'll find they are not push-to-talk either.  That'd be easy enough to check.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:20:15||alsj|Ed Mitchell, the Apollo 14 Lunar Module Pilot, takes over as CapCom.  Tony England is probably conferring with people in the Backroom and returns as CapCom at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1271036" target="new" target="alsj">127:10:36</a>.]</i></blockquote>
126:20:58||alsj|They will fill each of the PLSSs for four minutes.
126:22:53||alsj|Apollo 16 was launched at 17:54 hours Greenwich Mean Time, April 16, 1972; and it is currently 00:17 hours GMT, April 22.  It is just about sunset in Houston and communications from the LM and Command Module are being received through the NASA station at Goldstone California.  There are both 85-foot and 210-foot antennas available at Goldstone and John is speculating that the 210-foot dish is in use.
126:22:53|Duke|alsj|We had three 210s.  There was one at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid</a> and one in Australia, too.&quot;]
126:22:53||alsj|Charlie is mistaken.  Each of he three stations - Goldstone, Honeysuckle, and Madrid - each had an 85-foot-diameter antenna.  Goldstone also had a 210-foot dish and, if needed, A 210-foot dish was available at the Parkes radio astronomy facility in Australia.  The latter was used on Apollo 11 and during the Apollo 13 emergency.</i></blockquote>
126:23:44||alsj|The following exchange between John and Ed is probably a private joke.
126:24:41||alsj|Houston can be heard easily because there are large dishes and plenty of power available at the three tracking sites:  Goldstone, Honeysuckle Creek, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid</a>.  Conversely, the LM has only a modest amount of energy available and, because of the LM high-gain antenna malfunction, only the omni antennas are usable.
126:25:21||alsj|'Sock it to me' was a long running gag on the TV program, Laugh In, which was very popular at the time.
126:26:49||alsj|By switching the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> Mode switch to AR, Charlie will be able to read his oxygen quantity.
126:27:00||alsj|As indicated in the checklist, the expected reading after this first fill is 85 percent.]</i></blockquote>
126:27:19||alsj|Now, they have to do John's PLSS recharge.
126:27:19|Jones|alsj|Do you remember why you filled the PLSS while you're still wearing them?&quot;]
126:27:19|Duke|alsj|I think because we wanted to keep them hooked up with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> so we could tell what the gauges were (reading).  I think that was the reason; so we could read what was going in.  I'm not sure we did the water...No, we didn't do the water.  I think we had a little water gauge (at the back of the PLSS) we could see.  But you had to get that from behind.  But the O2, I think we checked the quantity.  So that was the reason.  And then we topped it off later on.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:27:46||alsj|John wants a drink of water.
126:28:36||alsj|Charlie is probably talking about his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bag</a>.

126:36:11|Jones|alsj|I don't think I understand what you meant here at 126:36:03.&quot;]
126:36:11|Duke|alsj|(When) you fall on your stomach with the camera on...&quot;]
126:36:11|Jones|alsj|Ah!
126:36:11|Duke|alsj|It sticks out there six/seven inches or so and you couldn't get down close enough (to the ground) to push off hard with your hands.  And I'd fallen down and there was a little crater behind me and what I did was just back up and got my feet down in it which gave me enough angle up that I could push;  and then I was up.  And then I just hopped out of the crater.&quot;]
126:36:11||alsj|There is TV coverage of Jack Schmitt performing a similar maneuver at the Apollo 17 Station 4 stop at Shorty Crater at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.sta4.html#1452839" target="new" target="alsj">145:28:39</a>.]</i></blockquote>
126:36:54||alsj|They will stow the RCUs in the bag that held the Liquid Cooled garments.
126:37:30|Duke|tech|You know all that Velcro on the floor; it just gets caked with dirt.  You can't stand on the floor.  I guess it didn't hurt anything; but I know, when we donned the suit, we had our <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jettison bag</a> down to stand on like everybody said; but our feet and hands and our arms were all full of dust when we put the suit on.  So it was all going into the suit.  And it didn't seem to bother anything.&quot;]
126:37:30||alsj|As John indicates here, the concern is that some of the dust could be picked up by the oxygen stream flowing back in to the PLSS and, possibly, could damage something.
126:37:30|Duke|tech|You don't know how much it's going to bother.  You don't have a feel for whether it's going to give you a problem or not.  There's just no way to avoid it.  The second EVA, we had in place (demonstrating) that much dirt and dust on the floor; and that's after cleaning each other real good (at the end of the first EVA).&quot;]
126:37:30|Young|tech|The place where most of the dirt came from - the place you can't clean - was the strap-on pockets we had.&quot;]
126:37:30|Duke|tech|We got smart after EVA-1 and, before we got in (on EVA-2 and EVA-3), we closed the (pocket) flap.  But, the first time, I got in with that flap open; and my pocket caught on the hatch sill and when I came in with that right leg, the dust just flopped out.  You had a pocket full.  You had a contingency sample right in your pocket.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:38:49||alsj|They are probably using a damp cloth to clean the connectors.]</i></blockquote>
126:39:22|Duke|alsj|You were jammed into the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a> so that you'd have dexterity at the end of your fingers.  And, if your fingernails were long, it would tend to hook up and it would tear 'em loose and you'd get blood blisters underneath your fingernails.  So, by cutting 'em back, it would eliminate that tendency to hang up and snag.  But it didn't seem to have any effect, because we ended up black and blue at the end of the finger tips; and I think it was just pressing hard against the suit and working against the suit that caused it.
126:39:45||alsj|Charlie probably has his back to John, who takes hold of the PLSS as Charlie frees it.
126:44:30||alsj|John has had a momentary mental block and didn't understand the instruction about the 'electrical dust cap'
126:45:42||alsj|They are taking PLSS battery No. 1 out of John's PLSS and are replacing it with No. 3, which they just brought up from the MESA.
126:45:02|Jones|alsj|Was the PLSS battery hot to the touch?&quot;]
126:45:02|Duke|alsj|You know, it's like any battery.  You use it and it gets hot.  I just felt it in my hand.&quot;]
126:45:02|Jones|alsj|Did you notice anything - like the RCU, maybe - being warm from having been out in the Sun?&quot;]
126:45:02|Duke|alsj|Uh-uh.  No.  The only thing I could feel was at the end of the last EVA, the cosmic ray detector.  We had to get it out of it's frame; and I held the frame while John pulled and I could feel the heat of that thing in my hands.&quot;]
126:45:02|Jones|alsj|And that had been out in the Sun through three EVAs.&quot;]
126:45:02|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And it was probably 250 degrees - or hotter.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

126:49:13|Duke|alsj|Yeah, you could do it standing up, by bending over just a little bit.  I remember the LiOH thing was down in the bottom section of the PLSS but, leaning it on the step, you could do it.
126:49:13|Jones|alsj|Which raises a curiosity question.  Down here on Earth, if you bend over something long enough and try to straighten  up, you can feel it.
126:49:13|Duke|alsj|Didn't have a problem up there in the one-sixth gravity.  And, of course, you could really hold the PLSS up or put it on the Ascent Engine cover if you wanted to.  I don't remember it being a problem to change that out.  We had to get this tool harness thing out of the way, first, so we could open the cover and get at it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
126:49:29||alsj|&quot;Agua&quot; is Spanish for &quot;water&quot;, and John probably wants Charlie to turn on the LM LCG pump for a moment so they can get some cooling.
126:51:24||alsj|On the audio tape, we can hear the sound of equipment being manipulated as they replace John's PLSS LiOH canister.  Readers should note that Apollo 16 is the only mission during which we get to hear substantial portions of the crew conversations during these post-EVA activities.
126:51:24|Jones|alsj|As I said previously, this is the first time I've ever heard anybody go through this part of the procedures; and you two sound very relaxed, comfortable, confident.  Is that the way it was?&quot;]
126:51:24|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  We'd gone through it a jillion times, it seems like, and we were just going through the checklists.  And, then, we're making comments about other stuff, here, while we're getting the work done.  Yeah, we're winding down.  Just real loose.

126:54:37|Jones|alsj|Tell me a little bit about getting John's PLSS up on the wall.&quot;]
126:54:37|Duke|alsj|It was hard to get the pins in right.
126:54:37|Jones|alsj|There were hard point attachments?
126:54:37|Duke|alsj|Yeah; three or four.  And they were on the PLSS frame, plus the hard points that had to go into the wall.  And I don't remember which was the male and the female; but you had to get it all lined up and all four had to be in.  And you were doing it blind and you couldn't look around and see into the side.  So it was tough to do.  And we'd had problems in training and we knew we were going to have problems; and that's why we commented on it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

126:54:53|Young|tech|One of the toughest things we did was stow the PLSS with the tool harness on it in the Commander's station and get it to lock.  There's no way to guide that thing in there.  There should be some way to guide it into the stow position.  You do not have any idea (how difficult that was).  It's a blind connector into that pin.  It's just by hit-and-miss that you get it in there and stow it.  What should be a minute job, if you could see what you're doing, takes 5 to 10 minutes.  It's necessary because you want to get that thing up and out of the way and make sure it's secured. The Apollo 15 crewmen were continually turning around and knocking it off the bulkhead, and that's no good.&quot;]

126:54:53||alsj|John is still trying to secure his PLSS.
126:58:20||alsj|Readers should note that they are both still wearing their suits.
126:58:59|Jones|alsj|Is this one of the things that would have been a lot easier with a little bit more elbow room in the cabin?&quot;]
126:58:59|Duke|alsj|No.  It was just that the design was bad.  You know, the hoses stayed real flat when it was initially stowed; but then, when you get the connectors in and re-connect it, it was just looser.  And it just didn't have any play in there and you really had to push it to get it on.  I remember all that now; and it was terrible.

127:14:28||alsj|John is joking that much of the weight must be the dust on the SCB.

The combined weight of the SCB and the sample is 6.1 kg or 13.5 pounds.  Because the scale is marked in 5-pound increments, this weight is indistinguishable from the 14 pounds Charlie read out to Houston.  Sample 60015 is a cataclastic anorthosite (cataclastic means that the rock has been deformed under pressure.  On Earth, cataclastic rocks are ususally associated with fault zones. In this case, impact stresses are the likely cause.  All surfaces except the bottom are thickly coated with glass.  The overall cosmic ray exposure age of the rock is about 2 million years, suggesting that the rock was ejected in the South Ray impact.  The glass coatings have a micrometeorite-exposure age of about 100,000 years, suggesting that, for most of the time since ejection, only the bottom surface was been exposed. Micrometeorite impacts cleaned much of the glass off that surface before the rock turned over - presumably by a small, local impact - about 100,000 years ago.]</i></blockquote>

In 1996, I asked Tony if, prior to the mission, Bill Muehlberger was known as &quot;Muley&quot; and, if not, whether the double meaning of &quot;Muley&quot;  - referring to Muehlberger and to the size of the rock - was obvious at the time.]
127:16:05|England, from a 1996 letter|alsj|I never heard anyone call Bill M. 'Muley', but I was aware that it referred to him.  Charlie played with words a lot so he probably invented the association with the rock on the spot.  We would have all understood it.  Bill is not only big, but he is a little stubborn.  The 'Muley' played on his name, his size, and, just a little, on his being stubborn.  Of course, I'd never say that when I was within Bill's reach.&quot;]
127:16:05|Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter|alsj|My nickname in college was 'Mully' - short version of Mull-(as it is pronounced)-berger. There were times when 'Mule-y' was also used!

127:26:06|Jones|alsj|Did you do very many vacuum chamber tests?
127:26:06|Duke|alsj|Yeah; we did two or three, if I remember.
127:26:06|Jones|alsj|Full up?
127:26:06|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we had our suits on a couple of times.  We did one or two at the Cape and, if I remember, one up at (Grumman, Bethpage) before they shipped it (meaning the LM) down (to the Cape).
127:26:06|Jones|alsj|How much of the operation did you do?
127:26:06|Duke|alsj|It was cabin operation.  We didn't do any of this stuff. We just sat there and flipped switches.  They had test procedures that we followed, so you just flipped switches as you listened to the test director.  They had various things they wanted to do in the loops.  So we got on board just to get familiar with the machine and how it works in a vacuum.&quot;]
127:26:06|Jones|alsj|So, other than yourselves and the suits, you didn't have much in there.  Did you go through a number of other types of tests with the LM fully equipped where you went through these routines?&quot;]
127:26:06|Duke|alsj|Not in the chamber, nor in the actual spacecraft.  We did it in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">simulator</a>.  We had a simulator - which was not the real simulator that we flew in to learn the flight procedures - but let's call it an EVA procedures simulator.  It was just a mock-up.  It had an oxygen system and it had a little comm, I think, and then the stowage was right.  And so we'd go through the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new" target="alsj">donning and doffing</a> exercises in real time.  I don't now how many times we did it, but a bunch.  Most of these procedures we had committed to memory, but we followed the checklist.  We'd done it a lot of times.&quot;]
127:26:06|Jones|alsj|Those would be the training exercises where the PLSSs were heavier...
127:26:06|Duke|alsj|They were lightweight ones but they were still heavy.  I think they were maybe like ninety pounds, or maybe it was lighter than that; but it was still heavy compared to what we had up on the Moon.  And it was in our regular training suits.  So it was an actual spacesuit and there were gloves and all that stuff.  And the connectors were real connectors.  I guess they had a lighter weight PLSS; they didn't have all the stuff in it.  And we would change out batteries and LiOH canisters and charge 'em - or simulate charging them.  It was real good training.
127:26:06|Jones|alsj|Was it a Comedy of Errors the first few times through it?
127:26:06|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  You know, just rattling around in there like a bull in a china shop.  And, you know, it never got any fun...I mean, we got better at it, of course.  But it was always a pain in the rear; you just hated doing it because it was so hard, and you got hot and cooling wasn't right.  But we knew we had to do it to learn it.  So we did it.
127:26:06|Young|tech|Every time we took the suit off...It's real handy that the thing (meaning the suit) is standing up by itself in one-sixth gravity.  It's really handy for you to close the zipper up to lube the pressure zipper and get those connectors (clean) before you put the thing away for the night  On the second and third EVA, because everything was really getting dirty - and I don't know whether it's a real problem of not, or an imaginary problem - we were really getting concerned about whether we were going to be able to do things like fasten the connectors.  So we were taking special care to lube everything and, therefore, we ran out of lube.&quot;]
127:26:06|Duke|tech|We had one (container of lube) left for the zipper on EVA-3.
127:26:06|Young|tech|I think you should have some more lube in case you do get to a situation where, as you're doing your last donning, something is not working right and you need to go back and lube it again to make sure.&quot;]
127:26:06|Duke|tech|Not only did we use the lube, but we used water and the towels to wipe around the outside of the connectors.  And the wrist rings.  It wasn't the O-ring part that was so stiff; it was the mating surface between the suit and the sliding ring.
127:26:06|Young|tech|Yes.  That's been remarked on before.  Somebody said they taped their wrist ring; but that seems to be like a kluge.  I think they should come up with something that keeps the dust out of the wrist ring.  Maybe an overflap that you Velcro on the other side of it to keep the dust out of there, because I just don't think you should have a problem donning and doffing.  We really got a lot of dust; and I don't see really any way out of it when you're holding a (sample) bag and Charlie's dumping dirt in there.  The dust goes all over the place and it's just as easy for it to go down your shirtsleeve as not.  The fact is, we had both dirt and rocks underneath the flap that you raise to get the glove open.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

127:26:06||alsj|John's next transmission comes when he reaches the bottom of the second paragraph at the top of Surface 3-5.  Because NASA Public Affairs was using the CSM feed, the tape used to compile audio for the ALSJ does not include this brief exchange.  Except for the first few seconds of the following clip does not contain any comm.
127:45:59|Jones|alsj|Jack had a bad allergic reaction to the dust, at least after their first EVA.  Did you?&quot;]
127:45:59|Duke|alsj|No. Uh-uh.  I read your comment here on the next page, 'Sounds like clogged sinuses.'  That's true.  Sinuses just don't drain well, up there, because of the low gravity.  And, in zero-gravity, it seemed like you didn't drain at all.  Plus, the low pressure gave you this nasally sound in your voice, (you see)?  And it felt like, a lot of times...You know, the sinuses were all full.  Then I think I had a little twang in my voice from the five-and-a-half psi versus the fourteen-and-a-half we're speaking at now.  So, occasionally you'd feel like you had a squeaky voice.
127:45:59|Young|tech|As we said before, we lubricated the zipper when we got the PGA off; and then fastened the zipper and pulled the seals down tight.  When we took the suits off, they were all covered with dust, up to our knees, even though we kicked our boots off (that is, stamped them on the ladder to knock dust off) as we came up the ladder.  We took the suits off and put them into a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jettison bag</a>, pulled the jettison bag up over the legs, and laid them on the couch (meaning the ascent engine cover) like everybody else has done.  We put a bag down on the floor to stand on, but that did not keep us from getting dust all over the place.  One of the problems was that we had dust on the bottom of the PLSSs even though we wiped them off, and dust on the side of the OPSs for some reason.  They were lying on the floor.  As a result, when we got into our LCGs (John probably means CWG - Constant Wear Garment - rather than LCG), we were sort of standing around...Like, I had one foot on an OPS and one foot on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new" target="alsj">midstep</a> and was sort of leaning back against the shelf on my side.  Charlie was sort of standing with his foot on the ETB and one foot on the midstep, and we were up out of the dirt.  Our hands were black when we started taking each other's wrist rings off.  We got our hands dirty and I didn't get the dirt off my hands until after we'd landed (on Earth at the end of the mission).  Washed them up good.  I don't think Charlie did (get his hands clean), either.  We managed to get dirt on the bottom of the LCGs, on our sleeves, and on our hands (and all of) that got into the suits.  It was just a little dust.  I don't know what problem it entailed, but it sure looked like it might become a problem.  The only thing I can say is we stayed out of the dirt as best we could.  It was all over the floor.  Just (not) hardly any way to get out of it.  We even had some on the midstep where we'd laid the ETB up there.  It was dust covered, too, from dropping in the dirt because the LEC was too long to keep it off the ground.&quot;]
127:45:59|Duke|tech|Another eight ounces on the stowage list in the form of a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jett bag</a> would be an outstanding addition to the LM stowage.
128:13:34|Jones|alsj|I gather that there was a (specific) sequence to go through to make sure there was still power in things as you were switching batteries?
128:13:34|Duke|alsj|There must have been something like that that they wanted me to do.  If you turn batteries 3 and 4 off before you turn batteries 1 and 2 on, you were going to be without any power.  Anyway, I followed the procedure because I knew I didn't want to drop power.  So that was a concern.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
128:13:34||alsj|NASA Public Affairs announces the start of a change-of-shift press briefing.  The first two lines of the next exchange between Charlie and Tony were not captured on the PAO tape.

128:14:06||alsj|Charlie then read the procedures on Surface 3-3 and looked at the Descent Electrical Power drawing, DES (Descent Electrical System) 2, in the Apollo 16 &amp; 17 LM Systems Data Book.  I looked for the switches in Figure 3-2 in the LM Operations Handbook.
128:14:06|Duke|alsj|There was a battery 1 and 2, and then there was a battery 3 and 4; and the 1 and 2 batteries were on the LMP's bus and the 3 and 4 were the Commander's batteries.  Then the Lunar Battery you could put on either bus.&quot;]
128:14:06|Jones|alsj|I haven't found the switch yet.
128:14:06|Duke|alsj|It's on panel 14 (on Charlie's side of the cabin). (Pause)  It has Descent Power/Lunar Batt (at the middle of the panel)&quot;]
128:14:06|Jones|alsj|Oh, there's 14.  I've got it.
128:14:06|Duke|alsj|You had a Commander's position or you had an LMP's position.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
128:19:09||alsj|The Apollo 15 crew experienced heart beat irregularities which, post-flight, were determined to have been caused by a potassium deficiency.  In an effort to eliminate the problem, the Apollo 16 crew was given large quantities of potassium-fortified fruit drinks.
128:21:16||alsj|Basalts are fine-grained rocks formed from molten lava on the surface and, hence at low pressure.  The fine-grained texture is a product of rapid cooling.  Virtually no pieces of basalt - other than small, incidental fragments in the regolith - were collected at the Apollo 16 site.]
128:21:16|Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter|alsj|We weren't expecting to find basalt at this landing site.  The light color of the region precluded the presence of dark (basaltic) rocks such as those we landed on in Apollo missions 11, 12, and 15.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
128:24:34||alsj|Because of the dust coating, Charlie is being appropriately cautious in his description of Big Muley ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-41550.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">175k</a> ).
128:24:34|Jones|alsj|Did you spend any time with the geologists and the samples after you got back?&quot;]
128:24:34|Duke|alsj|No.  And that's a mistake.  We didn't.  We went over to the Lunar Receiving Lab (LRL) to look at them as they unboxed them.  We touched a few of them - a day or so we spent, I guess.  But then we started going on those PR trips and then we went right back into training (as the Apollo 17 backup crew).  So we didn't do that, and that was a mistake.  I never figured out what Muley was.
128:24:34||alsj|In the 1981 compendium, &quot;Geology of the Apollo 16 Area, Central Lunar Highlands&quot;, which is U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1048, edited by G.E. Ulrich, C.A.

Muehlberger, Big Muley ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-41550.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">175k</a> ) is described as a dark-matrix breccia with light-colored clasts.

128:25:21|Muehlberger, from a 1997 e-mail message|alsj|Clearly, the questions were to confirm whether volcanic rocks or impact breccias were the common rocks; and whether the area was covered with material from South Ray Crater.
128:33:04||alsj|During the second EVA, John and Charlie noted the absence of bright-white soil at Station 4  (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta4.html#1445923" target="new" target="alsj">144:59:23</a>), Station 5 (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta5.html#1452011" target="new" target="alsj">145:20:11</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta5.html#1452726" target="new" target="alsj">145:27:26</a>), and Station 6 (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta6.html#1461656" target="new" target="alsj">146:16:56</a>).]</i></blockquote>
128:33:28||alsj|Benches or ledges on the inner walls of craters can be indicators of the base of the regolith, showing where the strength of the materials changes as the impactor goes from regolith to bedrock.]</i></blockquote>
128:35:23||alsj|It is currently about 02:30 hours Greenwich Mean Time (GMT/UTC) on April 22, 1972.  The Sun's elevation is about 27.1 degrees.  Charlie made his examination of Buster starting at about 124:31 - about 22:25 GMT/UTC on April 21 - and, at that time, the Sun's elevation was about 25.1 degrees.  At the lunar equator, the Sun rises about 0.5 degrees per hour.]
128:35:23|Jones|alsj|Certainly, in orbital pictures, Buster looks nice and round.  So it was just the distribution of rocks in there that (led to the supposition that Buster was a secondary)...&quot;]
128:35:23|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  I think that's the reason.  I don't think you can tell...It seems to me we learned (that), if it was a primary crater, you wouldn't have any rocks in there.  It hit and it all vaporized.  But there was plenty of blocks there, so that's why we thought it was secondary. And, looking at it from the side, you'd probably say it was maybe oblong; but when you take a top view of it - from the photographs - it obviously wasn't.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
128:36:05||alsj|Apollo 12 and 14 crews carried a 100-foot tether - which Tony is calling a &quot;rescue lanyard&quot; - which could be used if one member of a crew got down into a crater and couldn't get out without help.  However, the early crews discovered that it was easy to decide whether or not it was safe to venture into a given crater and the tether was not flown on the J missions.  See, for example, the Apollo 12 dialog and discussion at Bench Crater at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/a12.head_bench.html#1324345" target="new" target="alsj">132:43:45</a> and following.] </i></blockquote>
128:36:16||alsj|Charlie fell at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.thumper.html#1224042" target="new" target="alsj">122:40:42</a>.  Fendell was doing a TV pan at the time, and there is no TV record of Charlie's recovery.
128:36:16||alsj|The astronauts discovered that, by getting their feet into a small crater, it was easier to rock back to get their center-of-mass far enough back that they could stand.  There is video of Jack Schmitt doing this at Apollo 17 Station 4.
128:36:33||alsj|A typical crater ten meters in diameter will be about 2-3 meters  deep.
128:38:31||alsj|John is repeating the question in hopes that it will trigger a memory.]</i></blockquote>
128:41:43||alsj|As the sun rises 0.5 degrees per hour, the LM shadow gets shorter and things near the edge of the shadow will be sunlit relatively soon.  With the Sun currently at an elevation of about 26.5 degrees, the shadow of the 7-meter-tall LM is about 14 meters long and is shortening by about 0.3 m per hour.  When John first deployed the UV camera at about 119:40 - about 17:34 hours GMT on April 21 - the Sun was about 23 degrees above the horizon and the LM shadow was about 17 meters long.  By the end of EVA-3 at 171:11 - about 21:05 hours GMT on April 23 - the Sun will be 48 degrees above the horizon and the LM shadow will only be 6.3 meters long.  Readers should note that, according to the original Flight Plan, EVA-3 was to have ended about 16 hours earlier, when the Sun was at an elevation of 40 degrees.
128:44:16|Jones|alsj|I get the impression that both of you took to the geology.  Did John like the geology?
128:44:16|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we liked the geology.  They were a bunch of nice guys, the geologists we worked with - not only from Flagstaff, but <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lee_silver.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lee Silver</a> and the Caltech guys and Bill Muehlberger and his team up at UT (University of Texas at Austin).  And those guys we had at Houston - Dave Carrier and Fred H&ouml;rz.  So we had a good time in geology and we enjoyed it.  It was always good break to get out doing geology.&quot;]

128:44:32||alsj|The late Dale Jackson was a volcanologist who, according to Tony England, worked with the crew during their field exercises in Hawaii.  Lee Silver is a geologist at Caltech who played a major role in training the J-mission crews, and Bill Muehlberger, a geologist at the University of Texas, was the Apollo 16 Principal Investigator for Geology.

128:44:47||alsj|The following is an earlier conversation between Ken Mattingly and the CSM CapCom, Hank Hartsfield, starting at 126:10:38.]
128:44:47|Young|tech|(With regard to) the EVA-1 Debriefing, I thought that the questions were pretty good, with the exception of the kind of questions where they ask you  'what rock did you pick up at what station?'  Nobody can ever remember the answer to that. After you've gone through eight stations, all the rocks look the same.  You can't remember which rock you picked up at which station.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
128:46:06|Young|tech|On three or four different occasions on the first EVA, we pulled the purge valve off - either fastening or unfastening the seatbelt pulled the purge valve pin out.  I didn't know how it was happening.  Charlie never saw how it was happening.  We never experienced it before.  What we did on the second EVA (Prep at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2prep.html#1421255" target="new" target="alsj">142:12:55</a>) was to turn the purge valve around so that the plug came out this side.  I found during the (EVA-2) suit integrity check, when we pressurized the suit prior to egress, I could pull it that way.  So I said, 'Let's do that and get it out of the way', and that's probably the best way to take care of that problem in real time.  The ground was going to suggest that we tie the purge valve with a piece of string, and that would have just been something else to pull loose and get in the way.  We really had too much stuff to do.
128:46:06|Duke|tech|Yes.
128:46:06|Young|tech|It was just catching on something.  I don't know what.&quot;]
128:46:06|Duke|tech|I think it was your seatbelt, John.  It happened when you dismounted.&quot;]
128:46:06|Young|tech|Yes.  It must have happened when we dismounted, because we found it lying beside the Rover.&quot;]
128:46:06|Mattingly|tech|That's surprising.
128:46:06|Duke|tech|He did it three times.&quot;]
128:46:06|Young|tech|I did it three times on EVA-1 and had everybody nervous.  I didn't know what was going on.&quot;]
128:46:06|The following is taken from the Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|On three occasions during the first EVA, the pin assembly - red apple - on the Commander's purge valve was accidentally removed while ingressing or egressing the Lunar Roving Vehicle.  Each time, the assembly was found and re-inserted.  During subsequent EVAs, the crew wore their purge valves rotated from the recommended position to prevent the pin from being pulled out.  Testing indicates that the Lunar Rover lap-belt buckle could be the cause of the purge valve pin being accidentally removed.  A modification has been made to eliminate the barrel actuator spring in the purge valve and to shorten and stiffen the pin assembly lanyard.  This modification will require manual pull-out of the purge valve barrel, and will prove less chance of the red apple and lanyard being snagged.&quot;]

They had planned to arrive at Station 1 at about 4 hours 15 minutes into the EVA (123:08) but, because of the poor down-Sun visibility and the confusion at Halfway Crater, they arrived fifteen minutes late at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta1.html#1232354" target="new" target="alsj">123:23:54</a>.

The drive to Station 2 took only two minutes longer than expected - mostly because of the time they took to make sure they were at the right place, and they parked at Station 2 at 5 hours 28 minutes (124:21).  At this point they were about 26 minutes behind schedule.  Station 2 had been planned as a 56-minute stop but, because of the late departure from Station 1, Houston told the crew at the start of the drive from Station 1 that the stop would be cut to 19 minutes.  In reality, John and Charlie spent 27 minutes at Station 2 and left at 5 hours 55 minutes (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvlm1.html#1244820" target="new" target="alsj">124:48:20</a>).

128:50:45||alsj|Journal Contributor Doug Van Dorn offers the following in reference to John's comment about 'another 12  days'.  &quot;This is a typical, John Young minor mis-speak.  Apollo 16 was scheduled for a duration of 12 days.  Even though they were five days into the mission, and were looking at the likelihood of a somewhat shortened mission due to the CSM's MTVC problem (it ended up being a 10-day mission), in talking about when he'd be free to deep-six orange-flavored *anything* from his diet, John used the mission duration - 'another 12 days' - rather than 'when we get back'.&quot;

130:05:33|Jones|alsj|About chin level.  Would the pictures have shown anything about stroking the gears?&quot;]
130:05:33|Duke|alsj|I don't think we did.  I think Deke is right.  Somewhere, there is a report;  they looked at the pictures and I don't think we had any stroke.&quot;]

You know, we had a few of those little problems; but it was what we all expected and we were just used to 'em.  I guess, if you were going through it for the first time and you had all those problems, you'd really have been frustrated.  But we had been through it in training so much and had all those same problems that we just didn't get flustered.  We were really excited and looking forward to the next day.&quot;]
130:42:51|Jones|alsj|Similar kinds of problems but different sets.  But there'd always be something that'd...&quot;]
130:42:51|Duke|alsj|Well, I think that's the value of training, Eric.  That's why you need to train over and over again for these kind of missions, because it's the little things that bite you.  You just really need to be as familiar as you can with all your procedures and all your equipment.  And thank God John and I...Most of the crews understood that and they just went over and over and over again - in the suit...I mean, you got to train exactly like you're going to wear it and exactly like it's going to be.  You need good, high-fidelity training equipment; (and) not only on the spacecraft and the simulator, but also on this EVA stuff.  You know, going back to the Moon again or to Mars, you've got to have high-fidelity training.  Stuff's got to work like it's supposed to work.  Well, the experiment doesn't have to work but it's got to deploy right and you've got to know how to work it.  The same way it works for real, it's got to work that way in training, or you just get hopelessly lost.  Frustrated.  So it's really important to train.  Those guys going out 30 days on Mars are going to really need to be well trained.  I don't now how you're going to train for that, really.  It would be a lot of repetition, I'm sure.  That's probably the saving grace of it all, because you just keep repeating things.  It's critical to know your gear and to have training gear that matches the flight gear.&quot;]
130:42:51|Jones|alsj|Were there problems, early on in training, with things appearing late?  I mean, Pete said at one point, when he folded down the MESA, something like 'Gee, everything I've seen before'.&quot;]
130:42:51|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  We were in pretty good shape.  We kept pushing them for the L&amp;A, the landing model.  But they got that in plenty of time for us.  Prior to that, we'd been using the 15 one - our procedures, but their model.  But I don't remember anything else being a problem.  You know, we modified a few things based on 15; but they were minor and, so, they caught up and we had a chance to train with them.  Like <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new" target="alsj">seatbelts</a> on the Rover and things like that.
130:42:51|Jones|alsj|So it was getting fairly mature by the time you flew 16.&quot;]
130:42:51|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  The system pipeline was full...You know, Neil and them, they trained, I think, about three or four months; and we trained two years, really.  It doesn't take that long to get ready; but you had to reach a level peak and just try to hold that level in your training on out to your launch.&quot;]
130:42:51|Jones|alsj|I don't know if you've ever thought about it, but I engaged in a little idle speculation a few months ago that, if there was still money, if things had continued and NASA had had a go ahead for a base camp and a go ahead to start engineering on an unmanned, cargo-only LM....Take the Ascent Stage off, put a cargo module on, set it down some place, send a crew, and get started on a base camp.  (See, for example, Donald A. Beattie's </i>Taking Science to the Moon<i>.)  Was the program mature enough by the time of 16 or 17 to have had people start trying out procedures for that eventuality?  Try out some construction things and what have you?&quot;]
130:42:51|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah; they'd have been able to do it.  Yeah, we could have done that.  To me it was a real sophisticated program; everybody knew their job and the training guys we refer to in here were always a great help and they always knew the systems and you could always turn to them for an answer and they knew it.  We were real mature.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

Stu Roosa flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 14 and is the Backup CMP on Apollo 16 and is not very familiar with the LM systems.

131:22:24||alsj|The current time is 06:52 UTC  on 22 April 1972.  The Sun's elevation is 29 degrees; azimuth 85 degrees.

The centers of the 60-degree fields-of-view of detents 4 (right rear) and 6 (left rear) are offset by 60 degrees from the minus-Z axis.  Neither field-of-view would show the Sun.
131:22:24||alsj|Comm on the following clip starts at about the 2-minute mark.
131:23:57|Duke|alsj|Sun was shining in the AOT and then just coming down and just reflecting into the spacecraft.  It was like a reverse telescope, you see, and it was shining in and lighting up the whole cockpit.&quot;]
131:23:57|Jones|alsj|And shining up on John's hammock?  Would it have been at about AOT level?
131:23:57|Duke|alsj|No, it wasn't that high; but it was enough to diffuse into the whole spacecraft.  So you turn the AOT, on the outside, away from the Sun and it helped solve the problem.&quot;]
131:23:57|Jones|alsj|The 11 crew and the 12 crew complained about noise in the spacecraft.  And I think the 14 guys used earplugs or something like that but I don't remember any of the J-mission crews talking about noise.
131:23:57|Duke|alsj|I don't remember any.
131:23:57|Jones|alsj|No ECS whirs or anything like that?
131:23:57|Duke|alsj|Oh, there was some hum and the separator's going and converters and stuff...Well, I guess we had AC power down at this point, even.  So we didn't even have any inverters.  It might have been the inverters (that bothered 11 and 12) or it might have been the IMU and all that stuff.  We powered all that stuff down and all the J missions did.
131:23:57|Jones|alsj|Whereas the earlier...
131:23:57|Duke|alsj|They kept all that powered up, as far as I remember.  So it could have been some of that.  So the only thing I had...My mind's going - racing - so the second night, again, I took a Seconal.
131:23:57|Jones|alsj|Was it cold?
131:23:57|Duke|alsj|I slept in my LCG.  I don't remember (but) John might have taken his LCG off.  I slept in mine; and I left the urine collection device on.  John, I think, maybe took his off.  Any way, we'd slept...I remember sleeping in my LCG and I think that what John did, too.  It was very comfortable in it.&quot;]

139:23:53|Duke|alsj|We had a little knitted thing that looked like cheesecloth, really, but it had wider pattern on it.  We had 'em on the Command Module and the Lunar Module.  You just climb into it and zip it up.  It didn't look like it'd help you much, but it did.  I was surprised, because it had a pretty wide weave to it.  You could hold it up and see through it real easy.  It might be called a Sleep Restraint.

As indicated on the map, John and Charlie plan to travel along the ridge crest during the outbound traverse.  The appearance of Survey Ridge on the map is a bit deceiving in that the photographs used to construct the map was taken with the Sun low in the east and, consequently, a ridge should be darker on its west flank and brighter on its east flank - a shadow pattern opposite the one in the craters.  In fact, the west side of Survey Ridge is brighter than the east side and I suspect this is due to the presence of South Ray ejecta.
139:38:52||alsj|It is not easy to understand John's transmission because of the static and the fact that he has changed subjects.  Somebody else in Houston apparently understood what John said and told Tony.
139:39:17||alsj|As we will discover in a moment, the LM crew is no longer able to hear Tony because of a problem with the communications link between Houston and the receiving station in Australia.
139:39:41||alsj|The speaker is the Operations Manager at NASA's Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra, Mr. John Saxon, an Australian.  My thanks to Dean Davidson who located this information in the August 24, 1972 editions of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times.

139:45:29||alsj|During a lunch break, Charlie told me that, when he and John got home after the mission, they found that generous supplies of Swan had been delivered to their homes.
139:46:33||alsj|In an 2000 exchange of e-mail, Saxon reported &quot;I sat on the M &amp; O (main) console at Honeysuckle Creek Apollo station through all the Apollo and Skylab missions, and then moved into Deep Space support at Honeysuckle and then Tidbinbilla station, also here in the ACT (Australian Capital Territory).  Then a couple of years consulting with JPL - finally retiring in 1997. A wonderful 31 years for NASA - really privileged to have taken part in 'the golden years'. One of my jobs was to talk to the Astronauts if communications were lost.  I was about 1 sec away from talking to the Apollo-8 crew when they came out from behind the moon for the first time....but that's another story. :-)&quot;
139:46:33||alsj|&quot; (Prior to Apollo 16) I was beginning to think I'd never talk to the Astronauts on Apollo.  Of course, I could have left the system in a big way by congratulating Armstrong after 'One small step' - but we were a fairly disciplined if somewhat 'laid back' mob in those days!  One day I'll have to tell you the story of how I finally got to shout John Young a Swan Lager here in Canberra about 23 years later!&quot;]
139:46:33||alsj|Saxon has provided two photos from celebrations in Australia of the 25 anniversary of Apollo 11.

139:46:33||alsj|For our non-Australian/British readers, &quot;shout&quot; means buying a round of drinks, paying for dinner, etc. for others.  It derives from the practice of the person buying the next round calling loud enough to get the barman's attention.
139:49:03||alsj|At Station 9 they will collect a special soil sample by pressing a cloth pad on a patch of pristine soil that is not only out of sight of the LM but is also sheltered by an intervening rock. As can be seen on the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp269-s.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-II, 2 of 2</a>&quot; map, Station 8 is planned for a location in a bright portion of a ray from South Ray and is expected to yield samples of materials dug out by that impact.  Station 9 is planned for a darker-appearing site which, presumably, will be less coverage by South Ray material.  Tony's &quot;we're not at all sure you'll be able to rec(gonize)&quot; may refer to an anticipated difficulty they could have in recognizing when they are on or off a ray.]</i></blockquote>
139:50:15||alsj|John seems to be saying that they are about halfway from the center of the ray toward its eastern edge.  He is noted for the difficulty he sometimes has in expressing himself clearly.  See, however, his second try at 51:03]</i></blockquote>

139:52:47||alsj|John is saying that the pre-flight recommendations on parking orientations were based on the assumption that the Rover would be parked on a level spot.  Any vehicle roll or pitch will change the orientation of the shadows cast by the battery covers and, consequently, will change the degree of cooling the batteries will experience during the rest period.]</i></blockquote>

T-34 is the launch opportunity on the next Command Module pass over the landing site, which is at approximately 142 hours 11 minutes.]</i></blockquote>
139:59:01||alsj|The difference between the Ground Elapsed Time Tony just stated and the current Journal time is due to an 11 minute 48 second addition Houston made at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>, which was during the EVA-1 Prep.  The change has been made to clocks in Mission Control and the CSM but not yet on-board the LM.  The LM clock won't be changed until just before lift-off.  The update was dictated by CSM orbital changes resulting from the three-orbit delay in landing and, consequently, a late circularization burn.  CSM events like LOS, AOS and acquisition of photo targets weren't coming up according to Mattingly's flight plan, hence the change.]</i></blockquote>
139:59:56||alsj|In preparation for my visit to San Antonio, Charlie retrieved from storage various pieces of flight equipment he had kept.]
139:59:56|Jones|alsj|The pliers look like fairly ordinary needle-nose pliers.  It says 'Crescent 25, 4 1/2', and has a white plastic material on the handles.  They are fairly stiff if you try to  get them open past about 30 degrees or so.  They open and close easily closer in than that.  They are about 4 inches in total length, with a fairly wide opening in the back. The handles bow out from the pivot to a maximum opening of about 2 1/2 inches with the jaws closed.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

140:17:50||alsj|Because of the six-hour landing delay, John and Charlie had a rest period before doing the first EVA.  The handwritten notes on Page 3-7 - which are in Charlie's hand - represent procedure changes made prior to that first rest period.  At the bottom of the left-hand column, they had deleted the oxygen top-off after the first rest period because, of course, the PLSSs had not yet been used and still had their pre-flight charges.
140:19:30||alsj|They had planned to finish the eat period 70 minutes after wake-up.  John's first call of the morning was at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2wake.html#1390743" target="new" target="alsj">139:07:43</a> and, consequently, they are virtually on schedule.]
140:21:09||alsj|Three times during EVA-1, the locking pin on John's purge valve pulled out when he climbed out of the Rover and caught the pin, probably on his seat belt.  The Red Apple is simply a red ball attached to the pin by a cord so that the pin is easy to pull in an emergency.  On all three occasions, they found the pin - primarily because the Red Apple was easy to spot on the gray lunar surface - and Charlie re-installed it.

140:21:46||alsj|Although the discussion between John and Charlie is difficult to make out, it is clear they don't think much of the idea.  Based on the conversation Tony had with them during the EVA-1 debreifing and his emphasis, here, that they should do 'whatever you think's necessary, he doesn't think much of the idea, either.]</i></blockquote>

140:27:47||alsj|&quot;Mags&quot; is probably a reference to the ETB stowage on Surface 3-7.  In his second statement, John may be referring to the considerable amount of dust on the LM floor.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1post.html#1263737" target="new" target="alsj">126:37:37</a>.] </i></blockquote>
140:27:47||alsj|Here, John is referring to the fingerless cover gloves - much like a golf glove - they wore over their <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">EVA gloves</a> to protect them from abrasion during the ALSEP deployment.  They had planned to  discard the cover gloves after the first EVA because they add bulk to the hands and reduce finger dexterity.  John is concerned about working on the cosmic ray experiment and/or the heat flow connector without the added protection the cover gloves provide.
140:31:43||alsj|Here, Tony is taking the opportunity to let the crew know they are hot-miked.
140:40:30||alsj|I am not absolutely certain that John said &quot;LCG&quot; in his last transmission.  Charlie will report that they are <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new" target="alsj">donning</a> their suits in just a couple of minutes and it is possible that John is checking his over before donning it.]
140:40:30||alsj|Tony could be taking a toilet break or, more likely, getting the final word on any last minute changes to the checklists or plans for the upcoming EVA.  He returns as CapCom at 140:43:56. </i></blockquote>

141:22:42||alsj|In the following clip, the PAO Commentator discusses the clock update that was done in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.
141:36:39||alsj|They are now on Surface 4-2 and had planned to reach this point 2 hours 30 minutes after wake-up. and they are now about on schedule. As John's next set of transmissions indicate, they haven't quite started the Equipment Prep.
141:40:44||alsj|The x-ray fluorescence experiment uses the intensity and energy distribution of secondary x-rays emitted by the lunar surface as a result of illumination by solar x-rays.  The instrument produces maps of the abundance ratios of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon.
141:40:44||alsj|Journal Contributor David Harland notes &quot;As can be seen in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr-t19-1.jpg" title="table" target="new" target="alsj">table 19-1</a> in the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the highlands are generally rich in aluminum while the mare are rich in magnesium.  This is the lunar equivalent of the terrestrial distinction between the continental crust and the ocean floor.  The continental crust can be thought of as a silicon-aluminum rich scum floating on silicon-magnesium rich silicate mantle.&quot;
141:40:44||alsj|Mare Smythii is on the eastern limb of the Moon.  In Table 19-1 in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the Al/Si  and Mg/Si ratios for the East Smythii highlands are 0.61 and 0.20, respectively, while the values for Mare Foecunditatis are 0.41 and 0.26.
141:40:44||alsj|John's comment about not being able to land in the East Smythii highlands is a reference to the fact that a crew who wanted to land there would have to do so without the benefit of communications and guidance from Earth unless a comm relay satellite was put in lunar orbit in conjunction with the mission.  See the discussion in the Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal about a proposed landing on the lunar Farside.
141:46:43||alsj|They had planned to reach this point in the checklist 2 hours 46 minutes after wake-up and are now about 7 minutes ahead of the timeline.
141:46:43||alsj|Note, the time mentioned by the PAO Commentator  is 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript time because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.
141:46:43|Jones|alsj|Can you describe for me how you get the PLSSs on or off?
141:46:43|Duke|alsj|If I remember what we did, John would hold mine and I'd turn backwards and I could reach back and get the straps and pull them over and hook the two up here, at the sternum, on that little hook that we had up there.  And then I'd take the waist strap and hook it up.  And then, I'd hold John's - I've forgotten who went first - and, in one-sixth gravity, it was real easy to hold them up there.  To get 'em off, first we unbuckled the waist strap.  If I remember, just unbuckle one of the upper straps and then undid the other one and just let it slide off your back.  Then, you know, you could hold it with one strap, easy, and bring it around.  I mean, doing that in 1 g in training was awful.  We struggled and puffed and grunted and cussed; but, up there, it didn't turn out to be any problem.
141:46:43|Jones|alsj|How did the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> hook on?
141:46:43|Duke|alsj|If I remember, it was a clamp and you just pushed it down...It was a spring-loaded clamp, if you will, that fit next to the body of the RCU and you just pushed it over the hook and it forced the clamp open and, when it got over center, then it clicked back again.  And that held it.&quot;]
141:46:43|Jones|alsj|Were there any particular problems because of the lack of room in there?
141:46:43|Duke|alsj|Oh well, yeah.  It was awful.  We had rock boxes out and we had ETBs and we had helmet bags and we had gloves everywhere.  You know, it just got real crowded in there.  And oxygen hoses going everywhere.  Two sets.  If you didn't really watch it, you could lose things, easy.&quot;]
141:46:43|Jones|alsj|Kind of like trying to get dressed in a coat closet.&quot;]
141:46:43|Duke|alsj|Right.
141:46:43||alsj|In the following sequence, Flight Director Pete Frank responds to the call from Orion.
142:01:24|Duke|alsj|Tony must have had to go make a pit stop.
142:01:24|England, from a 1997 e-mail message|alsj|It seems unlikely that this was a pit stop so early in the shift.  It may have been a visit to the science room to get something clarified or to suggest some options that they might want to consider.  Generally, it wasn't a good idea to ask hypothetical questions on the loop.  You tended to get hysterical responses and start 'what-if' examinations that were premature.   I may have been concerned that my idea was dumb and preferred to find out about it quietly.&quot;]
142:01:24||alsj|I asked Tony if it was normal to have someone sitting with him at the CapCom console, because during many of the missions it is clear from the dialog at various points that the backup Commander or someone else was sitting with the CapCom.
142:01:24|England, from a 1997 e-mail message|alsj|As you know there were CSM and LM CapComs (starting with Apollo 14) when the vehicles were separate.  While there were two seats at each station, I remember only one person at each position most of the time.  I am sure that there were pit stops, but there weren't many - and, frankly, I can't remember how we did them.  Generally, I would not have hesitated to let the Flight Director handle comm during EVA prep or post if there were no systems issues being worked.  There would be many people in the MOCR who understood what was going on.  During the EVA, I would have been very reluctant to leave for any reason.  It is possible that this was a precautionary pit stop to lessen the likelihood of having to leave during the EVA.  I am sure that I drank fluids sparingly to reduce the risk.
142:01:24||alsj|My thanks to Journal Contributor Cathy James who suggested that I ask Tony about this procedural issue.
142:01:24||alsj|Now, Deke Slayton takes over as CapCom.
142:04:23||alsj|John has mis-spoken.  He should have read &quot;B Transmitter to Off&quot; instead of &quot;B Receiver to Off&quot;.  He catches his mistake in just a moment.
142:04:28||alsj|Charlie's relaxed tone of voice indicates that he recognized John's verbal mistake when it happened and ignored it.]</i></blockquote>
142:04:30||alsj|Next, they will configure John's audio panel and we next hear John near the bottom of the right-hand column on Surface 4-3.  Charlie is probably reading the steps to John but neither of them is transmitting.
142:05:03||alsj|Here, John is connecting Charlie's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../PLSSComm.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">PLSS comm</a> as per the second line on Surface 4-4.]</i></blockquote>
142:09:20||alsj|Charlie will turn on the LCG pump, briefly, so they can get some cooling.
142:09:58||alsj|Note that the time mentioned by the PAO Commentator in the following clip is 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript time because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.  The PAO Commentator's remarks cover John and Charlie's transmissions prior to 142:11:34.
142:12:19||alsj|John may be reminding Charlie to put the Suit Disconnect valve in Override/Suit Disconnect as per Surface 4-5.]</i></blockquote>
142:12:50||alsj|Charlie is suggesting that they change the orientation of John's purge valve pin and Red Apple to prevent it from pulling out.  This change works very well.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.debrief1.html#1284606" target="new" target="alsj">128:46:06</a>.]
142:12:50|Jones|alsj|Could you put the pin in either way?
142:12:50|Duke|alsj|Yeah, it didn't matter how you put it in.  We just practiced to put in so the thing (meaning the Red Apple) was down.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
142:13:15||alsj|As shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A14EMUHandbookV1FI-23.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">Figure I-23</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A14EMU-v1.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">EMU Handbook</a>, the diverter valve is part of the oxygen inflow connector and gives them the option of directing the  PLSS oxygen flow entirely into the helmet (the vertical position) or partly  into the suit torso (the horizontal position).  Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso.  In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.
142:13:32||alsj|Charlie will connect John's OPS O2 hose before installing John's purge valve, but he wants John to have the purge valve at the ready.]</i></blockquote>
142:13:55||alsj|Charlie has installed John's OPS hose, engaged the lock and the lock-lock, and is putting a dust cover over the connector.
142:13:55|Jones|alsj|Were the hose connectors relatively easy to use?&quot;]
142:13:55|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  The hard ones for me was the gloves.  I had a tough time.  You had to squeeze the locks and then rotate, and I think you had to...And it was hard for me to get my hand around and put enough pressure on it to close the locks.  The suit things, I just used two fingers - one on each of the little locks.  And then you could pull those out and rotate it around and then the hose would pop out.  And the same for the purge valve.&quot;]
142:13:55|Jones|alsj|And you could do that gloved.
142:13:55|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
142:14:00||alsj|While Charlie is installing John's purge valve, John is double checking Charlie's connectors.
142:15:16||alsj|on the metabolic rate, I've committed a million Btu's turning around to get...
142:15:22||alsj|Charlie seems to be saying that he has expended a lot of energy from turning around so often to start and stop the LM LCG pump.
142:16:52||alsj|They planned to start the helmet/glove donning 3 hours 21 minutes after wake-up.  Wake-up was at about  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2wake.html#1390743" target="new" target="alsj">139:07:43</a> and, consequently, they are 3 hours 9 minutes into the day and about 16 minutes ahead of the timeline.]</i></blockquote>
142:18:08||alsj|Charlie is making sure that the thermal cover at the back of the helmet is down and smooth.
142:18:47||alsj|This is probably a reference to the fence-painting scene in Mark Twain's &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;.
142:19:28||alsj|Charlie suspects that part of the thermal covering on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LEVA.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEVA</a> has gotten in the helmet ring lock.
142:20:34|Duke|alsj|The back of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LEVA.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEVA</a> went over the suit to protect the neckring and stuff.  That's what he's referring to.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
142:21:36|Jones|alsj|I assume it was going to be difficult to retrieve the tool harness.
142:21:36|Duke|alsj|Well, I was just amazed it came off.  You know, it wasn't supposed to come off.  And, yeah, it was hard to get up.  We had two PLSSs on and to pick something off the floor was tough.&quot;]
142:21:36|Young|tech|The first thing that happened to us that really slowed us down on EVA-1 was that Charlie's tool harness fell off, and we both had PLSSs on.  It was really tough to get the tool harness up off the floor, or off the side and underneath Charlie and put (it) back on with both PLSSs on.  We should be able to belt that tool harness on so it wouldn't fall off until such time as somebody makes a positive motion to get it off.  That's really a drag, that tool harness.  Not only could we never keep it from falling off, but we could never keep it on once we got it put on.  We could never keep it on in the vehicle; we always had to tighten it down.  We tightened it down repeatedly inside the vehicle.  Once we got outside the vehicle, we'd have to tighten it down for the last time.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
142:22:10||alsj|Charlie will hold one side of the tool harness while John stretches the other side around Charlie's PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
142:23:24||alsj|Charlie was probably facing his circuit breaker panel while John installed the tool harness and, probably, John is suggesting that he turn on the LCG pump for a moment before he turns back around, thereby saving some energy.
142:24:02||alsj|The Purge valve is on the right side of the suit and, in the normal position, the Red Apple is on the left side of the valve, toward the centerline of the chest.  John's Red Apple is now on the outside of the valve, relatively close to his right arm.
142:24:02|Jones|alsj|Let's see.  On this business about operating the apple. How did you do it in the normal position?
142:24:02|Duke|alsj|If I remember, the thing came this way (on the left side of the valve) and you could just reach across and pull it with your left hand.
142:24:02|Jones|alsj|And, with it switched over to the other side?
142:24:02|Duke|alsj|If it was outbound, you had to pull it this way.&quot;]
142:24:02|Jones|alsj|Pull it with your right hand.
142:24:02|Duke|alsj|And it wasn't any big deal.
142:24:02|Jones|alsj|I assume it would have been difficult to get your left hand all the way across there.&quot;]
142:24:02|Duke|alsj|Well, you could reach over there but, when you try to pull, you're pulling 180 (degrees) against the direction you're supposed to go.&quot;]
142:24:02|Jones|alsj|And you certainly couldn't have gotten out, away from the suit (to the right) with the left hand, so it had to be a right hand pull.
142:24:02|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
142:24:14||alsj|Charlie's tool harness may still be loose.
142:25:29||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LMHandbkf1-6.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 1-6 from the LM Operations Handbook</a> shows various cross-sections of the LM cabin.  The inner diameter of the cabin is 92 inches or 2.34 meters.  Directly in front of the hatch, the distance from the floor to the roof is about 2.03 meters and, where Charlie is standing, there is even less headroom.  The astronauts in the figure are each 6 feet 0 inches or 1.83 meters tall.
142:25:29|Jones|alsj|Could you have stood on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new" target="alsj">midstep</a>?
142:25:29|Duke|alsj|No.  I don't know anybody short enough to do that.  You couldn't stand up straight in the normal position, where you stood when you were flying the machine.  Well, you could without the OPS and the PLSS on; but when you put the PLSS on and the OPS, (gesturing) it stuck up here.
142:25:29|Jones|alsj|Three or four inches above your head.
142:25:29|Duke|alsj|Or so.  I don't remember; but it was high.  So you had to move inboard and it put you almost shoulder to shoulder.  When he said 'stand up', you know, I was bumping the top already with the OPS.&quot;]
142:25:29||alsj|Note added in August 2006:  I asked Charlie about standing on the midstep because I didn't properly understand what the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new" target="alsj">midstep</a> was.  I had thought that the flooring on which the astronauts stood was at the same level throughout the cabin and that the midstep was a small step of a few inches on the front of the ascent engine cover.  I didn't understand that there was an eighteen-inch rise from the floor at the front of the cabin up to decking that surrounds the ascent engine cover and extends to the back of the cabin.  The 'midstep' is that eighteen-inch rise.  Even at the centerline of the cabin where the ceiling is about 203 cm above the floor in the front of the cabin, the 18-inch (46 cm) midstep reduces the standing room to 157 cm (5 feet 2 inches).  As Charlie says, none of the astronauts is short enough to be able to stand upright on the midstep, even in street clothes.
142:25:38||alsj|&quot;Copasetic&quot; is a word meaning &quot;very satisfactory&quot; which was a part of popular, coffee-house culture during the early and mid-1950s when Charlie was in high school and at the Naval Academy.
142:27:01||alsj|They will now open the LCG pump circuit breaker as per the line at the middle of the right-hand column on Surface 4-5.]</i></blockquote>
142:27:30||alsj|John has skipped three steps in the checklist.]</i></blockquote>
142:28:20||alsj|Charlie is probably getting John's LM hoses back into the space over the Ascent Engine cover.
142:29:38||alsj|John is about to skip some more steps in the checklist.]</i></blockquote>
142:30:03||alsj|As readers will have noted by now, Charlie frequently engages in verbal play, saying &quot;vizzers&quot; rather than &quot;visors&quot; just for fun.
142:32:51||alsj|Long Pause.  John is going to partly inflate his suit to get it off his body.
142:32:51||alsj|Note that the time mentioned by the PAO Commentator  is 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript time because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.
142:33:55||alsj|The helmet/glove donning was supposed to have taken 12 minutes but, because of the problems they had with Charlie's tool harness, it took about 17 minutes.  They are still about ten minutes ahead of the timeline.
142:35:18||alsj|John has re-positioned his purge valve and is making sure he can still reach the Red Apple.  EVA-3 photo AS16-117-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18825" target="alsj">18825</a> shows it just below his camera handle, peeking out from behind the sample bags hooked to his finger.
142:36:52||alsj|Pig-Pen is a character in the Charles Schulz comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; who is perpetually dirty and walks around in a self-generated dust cloud .
142:37:51|Duke|alsj|What we were seeing was leaks in the suit.  And that was real good.  They were real tight suits.  I forgot the limit we had (0.3 psi in one minute), but we were real pleased with this.  As dirty as those suits were, I thought it was amazing that they were holding pressure.  We'd cleaned them the night before, you know, when we took 'em off.  We had some wet wipes and we wiped out the connectors and all the seals and the neckring and wiped out the ring around the helmet and the gloves.  And we took a wet towel and we cleaned 'em off as much as we could on the outside.  But the lunar dust is so fine it would just get into that fabric, even though the fabric's a real tight weave.  It would just get on the fabric and you couldn't get it off. That's why I was referring to us as Pig-Pen; we were really dirty looking.  But the suits were really good.
142:37:51||alsj|As indicated on Surface checklist page 3-8, they also applied lubricant to the various sealing surfaces during the EVA Preps.]</i></blockquote>
142:39:21||alsj|The EVA starts when they open the valve at 3.5 psi.]
142:39:21||alsj|Note that the time mentioned by the PAO Commentator in the following clip is 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript time because of a clock update.  Crew audio resumes at 142:41:40.
142:40:01|Duke|alsj|The overhead valve made a hissing sound.&quot;]
142:40:01|Jones|alsj|Do you have the impression that opening the overhead valve cleaned any of the dirt out?
142:40:01|Duke|alsj|No, not then.  When we opened the bottom hatch - the door - it took a little bit out.  That comes up later. Most of it was on the floor.  We didn't have any floating around.  It's not like zero-gravity.&quot;]
142:40:01|Jones|alsj|Was there a film of dust on the instruments?
142:40:01|Duke|alsj|No.
142:40:01||alsj|See below, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1424149" target="new" target="alsj">142:41:49</a>.]</i></blockquote>
142:40:03||alsj|As the cabin depressurizes, the relative pressure in the suit increases and the relief valve opens.
142:42:43||alsj|Charlie is trying to turn enough toward the rear of the cabin so John can reach the feedwater switch on the bottom right front corner of Charlie's PLSS.
142:42:43|Duke|alsj|We were almost face-to-face most of this time, 'cause we were helping one another with the connectors and gloves and stuff.  The only time you had to turn around is when...When I was facing John, of course, my circuit breaker panel was behind me and the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a> controls - which faced forward - it was right over here to the right rear; and so you had to turn around.  If you didn't watch it you'd keep wrapping yourself up in the hoses.  I had a lot of hoses over on my side and it was crowded.  But, in this case, I think I'm just turning towards the aft so John can get my water on.
142:44:03||alsj|The sublimator plates are positioned horizontally at the top of the PLSS, just below the OPS.  There is an opening in the PLSS thermal cover just behind the astronaut's neck where the water vapor given off by the sublimator escapes to the lunar vacuum.]</i></blockquote>
||alsj|As John prepares to go out through the hatch, he and Charlie are on cuff checklist pages  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR4-5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-4</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-04.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-4</a>, respectively.]</i></blockquote>
142:44:50||alsj|Charlie is behind the hatch and, apparently, is unable to move enough to open the hatch any farther.
142:45:55||alsj|Charlie probably closes the hatch, moves to John's side of the cabin, re-opens the hatch, and pushes the jett bag out to John, who drops it to the surface.  I am not absolutely certain as to the speaker IDs for the next two lines and it is possible that it is Charlie who speaks next.
142:46:24||alsj|It is possible that Charlie puts the ETB on the floor and pushes it out with his foot.]</i></blockquote>
142:49:36||alsj|Charlie's first task is to set SRC 2 on the MESA table, open it, and seal a control sample consisting of a roll of clean aluminum metal in a sample bag and place it in the SRC.  With regard to Charlie's next transmission, launch was at 11:54 a.m. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html#1052816" target="new" target="alsj">Central Standard Time</a>, 16 April 16 1972.  It is currently 10:44 a.m. on the 22nd and Charlie's transmission confirms that his wristwatch is set to Houston time.  He is probably using the stopwatch function to time the EVA.
142:50:59||alsj|John is asking if Fred Haise or someone else got a suit and backpack on and tried to operate the camera this close to a LM mock-up.
142:53:27||alsj|Charlie has nothing to do until John finishes with the UV camera.  Charlie doesn't have the TV procedures on his checklist and didn't training for them on a regular basis.  He is asking Tony to talk him through the procedures.
142:56:09||alsj|TV on.
142:56:09||alsj|The TV camera is pointed WSW.  Charlie crosses the field-of-view, heading for the back of the Rover where he will attach two SCBs as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-05.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-5</a>.  The TV picture moves slightly as he works  and, after a moment, we get a glimpse of his shadow at the bottom of the TV picture.]</i></blockquote>
142:56:23||alsj|The comm improves dramatically.
142:56:23|Young|tech|Charlie recommended that we put the (TV/HGA) alignment in both (cuff) checklists so that either guy could do it.
142:56:23|Duke|tech|I had to interfere with John's conversation with Houston (at the start of the EVA) to get that going.  But it's a place to save time, because the LMP really doesn't have that much to do on the (LRV) load-up.  Get the cameras configured, and the film stowed, is about all.  So, it's good to have some kind of cross-talk within the checklists so you don't have to interfere with the other guy.  Apollo 17 probably won't have that problem with it since they don't have the UV (camera); but, sure enough, something will be there.  And, so, they really should have those TV and LRV power-up procedures in both checklists.
142:56:23||alsj|Apollo 17 Commander Gene Cernan did not have any time-consuming tasks like the UV camera planned for the early parts of that mission's EVAs and the TV procedures were not included in LMP Jack Schmitt's cuff checklist.
142:56:23|Jones|alsj|During the last few minutes, John was resetting the UV, you were resetting the TV and Tony was trying to give instructions to both of you, simultaneously.  Do you have any comments about this?  In the Apollo context, where seconds and minutes were precious, was ad-libbing a noticeable distraction?
142:56:23|Duke|alsj|Well, it was hard.  We kept stepping on one another, comm-wise, at times.  You had to balance it out.  Normally, you wouldn't want to do that because you just want to stay with your checklist.  But John was supposed to power up the TV and I was supposed to get on with the rock boxes and stuff; but he had this problem with the UV camera.  And, so, I just decided to go turn on the television.  Normally, you wouldn't want to do that, because it is confusing.  Your stepping on one another and the CapCom's trying to talk to both of you and 'what'd you say' - especially when the comm's bad.  It wasn't a good idea all the time; but, in this case, instead of me just standing around twiddling my thumbs, I'm getting something done.  So, it was a balance; you had to make a decision whether to go ahead and do something or just stand there when the other guy has something else he's supposed to be doing that's out of the ordinary.&quot;]
142:56:23|Jones|alsj|With improvements in electronics since then, would it make any sense, in the lunar base era, to have separate comm?  What do they do in the Shuttle?&quot;]
142:56:23|Duke|alsj|I don't know.  They have one CapCom for the major operations, but there might be somebody in the science room.  And I think that's probably a good idea.  You know, you're probably going to have one frequency for the home base and another frequency for some group that's going out west and another group may be going south; so you'd want different comm for them and different people monitoring.  And then, like you do flying airplanes, you'd want some common emergency frequency that you could switch to and talk on that everybody's monitoring but nobody's talking on.  Military comm is like that.  You have a UHF radio that you're talking on one frequency, but you can receive on this emergency frequency or your regular frequency.  But then, to transmit, you've got to turn to the emergency frequency.
142:56:23|Jones|alsj|But, to receive, you don't.
142:56:23|Duke|alsj|No, you don't.  I think something like that would be pretty beneficial.  Of course, it depends on the scope of operations up there; but if you're going to stay for thirty days and have people running all over in different Rovers and stuff like that, you're going to need something.
142:56:23|Jones|alsj|Conceivably, one person back in Houston to talk to each individual, if necessary.
142:56:23|Duke|alsj|Yeah, well, I would probably say it's going to be somebody out on the lunar surface in the home base, maybe, talking.  It would be very expensive to keep Mission Control manned for six months or so, but I don't know.  You know, that's going to be a real big decision area: how are you going to manage this thing?  Are you going to do it all on the lunar surface or are you going to go back to Earth?
142:56:23|Jones|alsj|And you certainly can't run it on a second-by-second basis when you're on the Mars missions.
142:56:56||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> begins a clockwise pan.
142:57:25||alsj|This target is roughly 20 degrees east of north and, because John is south of the ladder, it seems unlikely he will be able to see the target past the LM.
142:57:54||alsj|A tempa-label is a patch with a series of spots which change from white to black at successively higher temperatures.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.
142:58:00||alsj|As Fendell reaches the clockwise stop, we get a glimpse of John working with the UV camera near the ladder.  Charlie is at the back of the Rover and is unfolding an SCB.
142:58:59||alsj|Charlie drops the bag, puts his left hand on the top of the Rover gate and bobs down to retrieve the bag.
142:59:12||alsj|After Charlie attaches the bag to the gate, he puts in two core tubes.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy99.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">99</a> (S88-52671) in Judy Allton's Apollo Toolbook shows an SCB with two core tubes stowed in interior pockets.
142:59:12||alsj|In Houston, the Flight Director is told that the UV experimenters want to change targets.  Quite properly, he decides not to bother John and says that they will &quot;press on&quot; with the mission.]</i></blockquote>
143:00:24||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-05.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-5</a>, Charlie is trying to get either a sample bag dispenser or a core cap dispenser.  He then removes the two core tubes he just placed in the SCB.
143:00:24||alsj|In Houston, the Flight Director tells the UV experimenters that he doesn't want them to select targets where there is any chance that the camera will be pointed at the LM. &quot;We're wasting time, here.&quot;]
143:00:24||alsj|Charlie seems to get a sample bag dispenser out of the SCB and then re-stows the core tube.]</i></blockquote>
143:01:10||alsj|The camera is pointing slightly west of north and not northeast.  If they stay with this pointing, in essence they will be looking at a random piece of sky.]</i></blockquote>
143:01:41||alsj|In Houston, the Flight Director relents and allows the UV experimenters to pick a new target.
143:01:59||alsj|Charlie comes around to the LMP seat and puts something down.  Whatever it is, it is not large enough to be a bag dispenser.]</i></blockquote>
143:02:15||alsj|This target is in the southwest direction.
143:02:15||alsj|Charlie returns to the back of the Rover, gets an SCB and takes it to the LMP seat.  He then examines his checklist and goes to get the ETB, which has been hanging from the front edge of the MESA.  During the following conversation between John and Tony, Charlie takes the ETB to the CDR seat.  Note that, as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR4-5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-5</a>, John was supposed to have unloaded the ETB.  Charlie does not have the details on his checklist (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-05.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-5</a>)but, probably having watched John do it often enough in training, doesn't have to ask Tony for instructions
143:03:16||alsj|John has turned to face east and walks to the cosmic ray experiment, which is out of our view on the south side of the spacecraft.]</i></blockquote>
143:03:19||alsj|Fendell starts panning counter-clockwise.
143:03:28||alsj|Before John and Charlie start the drive to Stone Mountain, one of them takes two pictures of the Cosmic Ray Experiment, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17441" target="new" target="alsj">17441</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17442" target="new" target="alsj">17442</a>.] </i></blockquote>
143:05:24||alsj|Although John is aware that he lost a lot of time because of the UV camera, he sounds relaxed and, obviously, is not in a mood to complain.
143:05:31||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the CDR seat.  He is holding the ETB in his left hand and is reaching in with his right.  He pulls something out - probably a film magazine - and stows it under the CDR seat.
143:05:45||alsj|John comes up behind Charlie from the back of the Rover but, during the following is out of view while he works on the right side of Charlie's PLSS.
143:05:59||alsj|John comes around to the left side of Charlie's PLSS to check that part of the harness.
143:06:26||alsj|Charlie has just withdrawn the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="new" target="alsj">dark slide</a> from a film magazine, installed the magazine in the 500mm camera, and then advanced a frame so that the next picture will be on unexposed film.  As Charlie works at the CDR seat, we get a glimpse of John as he examines his checklist.
143:06:53||alsj|Fendell starts to pan clockwise just as John walks toward the front of the Rover, looking at his checklist as he goes.  One of the raised battery covers is visible in the foreground.
143:06:59||alsj|A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16brush.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC71PC777" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71PC-777</a> shows the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> stowed on the front of the training Rover.
143:07:38||alsj|Tony is warning Charlie that somebody will take the suggestion seriously and design a dustbrush dustbrush for Apollo 17.
143:07:38|Jones|alsj|Were there people in the support rooms listening to this and writing things down that needed to be changed or added.  Is that the implication of this?&quot;]
143:07:38|Duke|alsj|Well, the implication is that somebody might think, 'Oh, yeah, we do need that', and add something else to the stowage list when we were just kidding.  But lot of times (in training), though, things you thought of, like that, would result in a change in the procedures or a change to the equipment, because they always wanted to try to make it work right.  We were just teasing; but some people take those comments sometimes and say, 'Oh, yeah'; and think it's gospel; and we really didn't mean it that way.
143:07:38|Jones|alsj|Did you run into that occasionally?  Cases where 'The Astronaut Speaks' and something happens even though you hadn't thought it through?&quot;]
143:07:38|Duke|alsj|Not without going through the change boards.  But if you had something you wanted to change and you fought for it hard enough, they'd usually do it.  But you'd have to take it all the way up to the change boards.
143:07:38||alsj|Fendell has panned to the left and we have a view of Charlie's torso and legs as he works at the CDR seat.
143:07:56||alsj|Charlie closes John's seat and takes the ETB to the MESA.  Fendell shifts his aim down, giving us a view of the battery mirrors just as John pushes the cover closed.
143:08:00||alsj|A puff of dust flies off the battery cover as it falls shut.  John then presses the cover with his right hand.]</i></blockquote>
143:08:17||alsj|Fendell raises his aim.  John is no longer in sight.
143:08:30||alsj|After John used the LPM at Station 2, he did his best to rewind the ribbon cable that connects the sensor to the gauge mounted on the back of the Rover.  Obviously, he didn't get it wound very neatly.
143:08:32||alsj|Fendell starts a clockwise pan.
143:08:49||alsj|Tony is probably saying that the UV experimenters may not have been on the current target long enough to have good data.
143:09:33||alsj|During our mission review, Charlie told me that, before the Descartes maps were ready for training purposes, he and John used copies of the Apollo 15 maps.  Those, of course, showed Hadley Rille.
143:09:43||alsj|This is a reference to training exercises conducted at the Cape.
143:10:05||alsj|On Apollo 15, Jim Irwin broke his antenna when he and Dave Scott forgot to stow it before he climbed back in the LM.  In Houston, Flight is told that they need the antennas up because, if they bend over, the comm can deteriorate.
143:10:24||alsj|Fendell stops his pan with the MESA on the left side of the frame.  Charlie is in view for a few seconds but then goes off-camera to the right.
143:10:27||alsj|Big Muley, the sample collected near the Rover at Plum crater is a 28x18x16 cm rock weighing 11.7 kilograms.  A &quot;double&quot; Muley is clearly too big for John to collect, especially from under the spacecraft.
143:10:32||alsj|Fendell completes the pan and finds Charlie at the back of the Rover.  John is at the right edge of the picture he is facing Charlie and is bent at the waist to get the top of his OPS into reach.  He has his left hand on the top of the gate for stability.
143:10:43||alsj|Charlie's cryptic comment about his camera is probably a reference to the fact that, with it on, he can't get very close to John.
143:10:43|Young|tech|(During training) it had been easy for us to deploy our antennas when we were on the surface but, once we were in one-sixth gravity, the only way that I could reach up to deploy Charlie's antenna was to have him come over and grab hold of something like the ladder or the Rover and bend over so I could get my hand up to it.  I just couldn't get a hand on it.  That took a little more time because we had to move over to a new position.  I don't think the communications would have been bad if we'd left the antennas stowed.  I ended up breaking one because we forgot to re-stow it (at the end of an EVA).  I'm not sure we shouldn't leave them stowed.&quot;]
143:10:43||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the left and John heads toward the LM ladder.]</i></blockquote>
143:11:15||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds Charlie at the LMP seat, just as he turns his checklist page to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-06.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-6</a>.
143:11:35||alsj|After taking the LMP Hasselblad off his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> bracket, Charlie has run off-camera to the right to swap cameras with John.  Fendell pans right to follow.
143:11:36||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie beyond the Rover console.]</i></blockquote>
143:11:50||alsj|The sequence of tasks had been designed, partly, to ensure that John and Charlie didn't get in each other's way.  Consequently, they are used to working alone during this sequence of tasks and Charlie is amused that they - the only two people on the Moon - have bumped into each other.
143:12:06||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the left, going around the south side of the LM.  John bobs down to pick an object - possibly a dropped bag - off the ground.
143:12:06||alsj|Charlie may be reading a note on his checklist, probably a reference to his intention to leave a medallion on the Moon to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947.  The original flight plan had the start of EVA-2 at about 125 hours into the mission, or about 6 p.m. 21 April 1972, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html#1052816" target="new" target="alsj">Central Standard Time</a>.  Charlie mentions the anniversary during the EVA-3 closeout at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.clsout3.html#1701951" target="new" target="alsj">170:19:51</a>, having placed the medallion on the ground earlier and having taken AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18844" target="new" target="alsj">18844</a> and three other pictures to document it.

As Fendell pans left, Charlie comes into view, using a skipping stride as he goes clockwise around the spacecraft.]</i></blockquote>
143:12:30||alsj|Fendell has panned left until the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">plus-Y</a> (north) and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">minus-Z</a> (east) footpads are at the right side of the TV picture.

Fendell reverses direction.]</i></blockquote>
143:13:36||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and finds John, who is visible beyond the console as he collects samples.  Although most of our view is blocked by the console, it looks like he is just south of the LM shadow.
143:13:46||alsj|Charlie's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1431346.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4 o'clock pan</a> consists of frames AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17419" target="new" target="alsj">17419</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17440" target="new" target="alsj">17440</a>.]

'HBW' is High-Speed Black-and-White and 'HCEX' is High-Speed Color Exterior.
143:13:53||alsj|The Sun has risen about 8 degrees in the sixteen hours since the end of EVA-1.  If the pattern of lineations is a lighting effect, it would be expected to change as the Sun rises.
143:13:53||alsj|John is taking a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;before&quot; photos from the south of sample 60025. These are AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17866" target="new" target="alsj">17866</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17867" target="new" target="alsj">17867</a>.

143:13:53||alsj|Fendell zooms in on John and manages to keep him in view as he bobs down to grab the sample in his right hand.  He has a sample bag in his left hand.   He came toward the sample from the north and, as he rises, he runs forward three or four steps to keep his balance.  In the cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;,  AS16-110-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17868" target="new" target="alsj">17868</a>, the imprints made by John's right knee and his right boot as he bobbed down to grab the sample are probably the ones to the right of center.  The imprint of the sample is just to the left of center.  The imprint John made with his right boot as he ran forward to regain his footing is probably the one at bottom right.
143:14:41||alsj|Tony is suggesting that Charlie wait to describe the lineations during the drive to Station 4.
143:14:53||alsj|John has dropped the individual sample bag he was holding.  During the following description, John is standing with his back to us, facing southwest so that he can get some sunlight on the rock.
143:14:53||alsj|Charlie comes into view briefly as he goes around to the south side of the LM to photograph the Cosmic Ray Experiment.]</i></blockquote>
143:14:53||alsj|This is sample 60025, a 1.8 kg white-matrix breccia.

143:14:53||alsj|Zap craters - also known as zap pits - are small craters dug into the surface or rocks by small, high velocity impacts.  Zap craters are often surrounded by and/or lined with glass created in the impact.
143:15:46||alsj|John takes the sample to the Rover and goes out of view as he goes toward the LMP seat.
143:15:59||alsj|Charlie's pictures are AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17441" target="new" target="alsj">17441</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17442" target="new" target="alsj">17442</a>.

The fuel cask is beyond the strut on the southeast face of the Descent Stage.  Note the various ALSEP and LRV deployment tapes in the area.  Frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17442" target="new" target="alsj">17442</a> is an up-Sun and shows relatively little detail because of the shadows.] </i></blockquote>
143:16:22||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds John as he raises the LMP seat and puts sample 60025 in the seat pan.  Charlie is in the background, beyond the UV camera.
143:16:27||alsj|As he indicates in a moment, Charlie is talking about the ALSEP and LRV off-load cables which litter the area around the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">minus-Y</a> (south) footpad.

143:16:30||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right.
143:16:33||alsj|We get a good view of John as he tries to get the camera off the bracket on the front of the RCU.  It takes him several seconds to get it loose.  At some point, John or Charlie gets an accidental picture of one of the fenders, AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17869" target="new" target="alsj">17869</a>.] </i></blockquote>
143:17:00||alsj|John finally gets the camera free and hands it across the Rover seats to Charlie, who is out of view next to the CDR seat.]</i></blockquote>
143:17:10||alsj|Previously, Charlie had put sample bag dispensers on both seats and he will put one on John's camera while John puts one on Charlie's camera.
143:17:33||alsj|John goes around to the back of the Rover, carrying the SCB.  Fendell follows and we watch John put the SCB on the left side of Charlie's PLSS.  Because the TV is looking back across the seats and tool carrier, we don't seen much of what John's doing.]</i></blockquote>
143:17:36||alsj|The Special Environmental Sample Container is a vacuum sealed can they will use to bring a selected soil sample back to Earth for analysis of volatile components.]</i></blockquote>
143:18:20||alsj|Charlie bends at the waist about 30 degrees.  John needs to fasten the bottom of the bag to the PLSS.
143:18:55||alsj|The only problem with Charlie's hypothesis is that disturbed soil is darker only near the LM.  As shown in photos taken from the Command Module, the soil around the LM is lighter than the normal surface.  Although the precise mechanism that causes the surface to be more reflective isn't known, it is undoubtedly caused by the Descent Engine plume during the landing.  When the astronauts disturb the surface near the LM, it returns to its normal color.  Down-Sun photos taken on various missions show darkened soil in that direction.  See, for example, AS17-140<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/images17.html#21355" target="new" target="alsj">21355</a>.]</i></blockquote>
143:19:01||alsj|Charlie is struggling to open the latch that is holding an SCB on the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
143:19:13||alsj|Charlie is saying that he had trouble closing the SCB latch at the start of the EVA.
143:19:18||alsj|Charlie frees the SCB.
143:19:19||alsj|Charlie goes to the right side of John's PLSS and John bends his knees slightly so Charlie can have an easier time getting the top of the bag attached.]</i></blockquote>
143:20:03||alsj|John turns 30 or 40 degrees to his left.  Charlie is working on the bottom SCB attachments.]</i></blockquote>
143:21:06||alsj|As he reported at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2prep.html#1420932" target="new" target="alsj">142:09:32</a>, John started the EVA with 92 percent oxygen. Charlie started with 94 percent.

Extrapolation of that use rate would imply a 7 hour 40 minute capability.  According to the Apollo 16 Mission Report, John started the EVA with 1.81 pounds of oxygen and consumed 1.22 pounds in 444 minutes and, in a typical 40 minutes, he used 11 percent of his initial charge.  Consequently, he could be expected to have 89 percent of 92 percent - that is, 82 percent - remaining.  Given uncertainties in gauge performance and expected variations in use rate with work load, his present reading of 84 is entirely reasonable.]</i></blockquote>
143:21:28||alsj|Charlie finishes attaching John's SCB and John goes off-camera to the right.  Charlie tilts his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> with his right hand to get a better look at the flags and gauges on the top.]

143:21:46||alsj|Charlie goes to the LMP seat.
143:21:59||alsj|Charlie gets the LMP camera off his seat and puts it on his RCU.
143:22:16||alsj|Charlie leans in so he can see the film advance indicator and briefly switches on the 16-mm camera.]</i></blockquote>
143:22:25||alsj|Charlie tightens the map holder and then raises the LMP seat, probably so he can stow a spare SCB in the seat pan as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-06.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-6</a>.]</i></blockquote>
143:22:50||alsj|Charlie picks up sample 60025, the 1.8-kg rock John collected a few minutes earlier, and examines it.  In the background, John goes to the UV camera.
143:22:50||alsj|Readers should note that zero azimuth on the UV camera is west, rather than north.  Consequently, the new azimuth is just slightly west of south.]</i></blockquote>
143:22:50||alsj|Charlie taps the rock several times against his seat back to knock some of the dust off so he can get a better look at the minerals.
143:23:47||alsj|Before the flight, some of the geologists believed that Stone Mountain was a volcanic construct and, here, the UV camera is being pointed in the general direction of the Mountain to look for telltale emissions.  As indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf13-3.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">13-3</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the field-of-view is about 20 degrees across.
143:23:47||alsj|Charlie puts the rock back in the LMP seat pan and closes the seat.  He then adjusts the 16-mm camera.
143:23:47|Jones|alsj|I'm a little surprised that you didn't say anything about that rock.&quot;]
143:23:47|Duke|alsj|I think there was probably just too much going on, and I just didn't want to take time to describe it.
143:24:04||alsj|John decides not to wait for an answer and returns to the Rover.  Charlie turns to face the TV camera.
143:24:19||alsj|Charlie consults his checklist one last time to make sure all the tasks have been done.
143:24:39||alsj|As indicated in his transmission at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1432457" target="new" target="alsj">143:24:57</a>, John probably now understands Charlie's cryptic &quot;Happy birthday&quot; at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1431212" target="new" target="alsj">143:12:12</a>.
143:24:52||alsj|TV off.  They had planned to reach this point in the checklist at 46 minutes into the EVA.  The EVA started at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2prep.html#1424000" target="new" target="alsj">142:40:00</a> and, consequently, they are on schedule.]</i></blockquote>
143:24:52||alsj|John is asking if there are any revisions to the bearing and range targets for Station 4.  The planned traverse is shown on maps <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-I, III; 1 of 3</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp268-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-II; 1 of 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp269-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-II; 2 of 2</a>.  As Charlie mentions in a comment after <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1433116" target="new" target="alsj">143:31:16</a>, the map he actually used during the traverse was a larger-scale <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a> showing the entire traverse.  As indicated on that map, the first segment of the traverse was to have been a drive of 1.3 km on a heading of 173.  Note that a zero Rover heading is north.  In Tony's next transmission, Tony gives John an initial heading of 162 because they landed near CB.1/80.6 and not at CA.0/81.0 as planned.]</i></blockquote>
143:25:34||alsj|Because the Rover Nav system worked superbly during EVA-1, John is proposing to skip the Nav alignment procedures on the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp302.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Decal</a>.]</i></blockquote>
143:30:39|Duke|alsj|My PLSS antenna was getting tangled up in the high-gain antenna.
143:31:01|Jones|alsj|So you had a pencil - or a pen - in the suit?&quot;]
143:31:01|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Right up here (on the left sleeve).
143:31:01|Jones|alsj|What sorts of things  did they imagine you writing down?&quot;]
143:31:01|Duke|alsj|I don't remember.  (Laughing)  Probably things like changes in the maps and those kind of things.  You know, we'd write on the maps  That's the only thing I can think of;  but we had a pencil with us.&quot;]
143:31:01|Jones|alsj|I don't </i>ever<i> remember anybody using one.&quot;]
143:31:01|Duke|alsj|No.   We didn't.
143:31:01|Jones|alsj|Do you remember using one during training - marking maps and whatever?&quot;]
143:31:01|Duke|alsj|Nope
143:31:01||alsj|It was much easier to ask CapCom to take a note for later reference than to get the pencil out and write something down.
143:31:08|Duke|tech|The map holder is worthless.  You get in there with a 16-mm camera, your Hasselblad, and your knee.  By the time you get in, you're pushing the map holder out of the way.  It's sitting up there and you can't see the maps. What I ended up doing was taking one with the headings and topography on it - the 1/25,000 (for example, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 3.6.2-2</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume) - and I wedged it between the 16-mm camera and the staff.  That's a great place for the map because you can look up at it and see it.  You can reach up and pull it out if you have to and just push it right back and wedge it in place.  Unfortunately, our maps and photographs didn't look anything like the topography.&quot;]
143:31:08|Young|tech|No resemblance to where we were.&quot;]
143:31:08|Duke|tech|The Rover Nav as working so good; and we could see our landmarks.  So, we had no trouble navigating.  We really didn't need the maps; but, where they were stowed, they were useless.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
||alsj|Activities during the traverse from the LM to Station 4 are detailed in Brian McInall's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_EVA_2_LM_to_STA_4_Traverse_Map-LROC_M175179080LR_Apr_2018.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Planimetric Map</a>.
143:31:21|Jones|alsj|How hard was it to reach forward to get the DAC?
143:31:21|Duke|alsj|It wasn't so far.  It was just up here - left arm up - and
143:31:21|Jones|alsj|So you didn't have to lean forward and pull your PLSS off of the seat.
143:31:21|Duke|alsj|Not that I remember.
143:31:31||alsj|As indicated on the EVA-II <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a>, which will be Charlie's primary reference during the traverse, the first segment of the drive had been planned to be 1.3 km on a heading on 173.  Because John landed farther north and west than planned, Tony gave them a new heading of 162 at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2prelim.html#1432520" target="new" target="alsj">143:25:20</a>, which Charlie seems to have mis-remembered.  Over a distance of a kilometer, the difference is a trivial 35 meters.
143:31:31||alsj|Brian McInall has created a map (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM-toStation4TraverseMapLROC-M175179080LR_May2016.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">11 Mb</a>) of the traverse from the LM to Station 4, using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) image M175179080LR as the base and adding Rover locations derived from the Hasselblad and Data Acquisition Camera (DAC; 16-mm motion picture) images taken during the drive, and from occasional segments of Rover tracks visible in the LROC image.
143:31:31||alsj|The complete DAC footage for the drive to Station 4 is available on the Apollo 16 DVD set available from Spacecraft films and from a 31 minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STvUNSoIlsg" target="new" target="alsj">YouTube clip</a> prepared by Diego Trystero.
143:31:55||alsj|Charlie's photos for the first part of the traverse are AS16-110-
143:31:55||alsj|See, also, a detail from Brian McInall's traverse map that includes the 17870-9 camera stations (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LMtoStation4_17870-9.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1.3 Mb</a>.
143:32:32||alsj|Charlie has mis-spoken.  The range to the LM is 0.1 km.
143:32:40||alsj|&quot;Cobbles&quot; are pieces of rock between about 6.4 cm to 25.6 cm.
143:32:40||alsj|&quot;Secondaries&quot; are craters formed by ejecta from other impacts; and an &quot;indurated secondary&quot; is a secondary which produced ejecta in the form of fragments of compressed regolith.
143:32:40|Jones|alsj|Do you have any recollection of how Survey looked.  I gather it was well up off the local terrain.
143:32:40|Duke|alsj|Well, it was visible.  We were sort of going downslope and it was just a big ridge up there.  You know, it looked like we were going to have to go up like a rolling hill.
143:32:40|Jones|alsj|Similar size to the ones around the LM?
143:32:40|Duke|alsj|Survey was bigger, taller.
143:32:40||alsj|We then looked at Figure 6-4 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-4.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">648k</a> ) in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  The climb

143:33:25||alsj|Charlie probably reaches up to the DAC and, in process,
143:34:10||alsj|Phantom Crater is east of the outbound track at
143:34:32||alsj|John landed near CB.1/80.5 and a LM bearing/range of 350/0.3 would put them near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BZ.6/80.8</a>.  They are probably passing northern Double Spot, rather than WC.  The latter is at BX.8/79.9.  Charlie's next picture is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17876" target="new" target="alsj">AS16-110-17876</a>.  The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LMtoStation4_17870-9.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">relevant portion of the traverse map</a> includes the locations of 17870-79.
143:35:32||alsj|As indicated on the
143:36:06||alsj|The back end of the Rover may have broken out as the result of a turn to avoid a crater.  McInall indates that the skid occured at about BY.7/81.2. Charlie's next picture is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17877" target="new" target="alsj">AS16-110-17877</a>.
143:36:06||alsj|With regard to the skid and the <a href="a16_1433553GreatBigSkid.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">accompanying LRV Visible Tracks inset</a>, McInall writes &quot;The yellow traverse track through this area (as with all areas of the traverse) was created in reference to the 16mm DAC footage. The version of the footage that I have (from the Spacecraft Films Apollo 16 DVD set, but also available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STvUNSoIlsg" target="new" target="alsj">YouTube</a>) has the audio nicely synched up for the most part. At the moment of the great big skid, you can visually see that the rover rotated counter clockwise to face more eastward. Unfortunately we don't see the tracks reflecting this. &quot;
143:36:06||alsj|On the audio track, Charlie's &quot;Yeow!&quot; comes at 4:51 while, in the DAC sequence, there is a sudden discontinuity in the Rover heading at 4:56.
143:36:06||alsj|McInall &quot;The width of a rover wheel track is right at the limit of resolution in the LROC imagery (0.4 meters /pix). That and lighting angle along with surface slope etc. probably all play a role in how and where we can see the tracks. Added to this, I believe that in places where we do see the tracks, it's either because for some reason the wheels were digging in and kicking up dust and there by lowering the albedo, resulting in dark “tracks”, or in other circumstances the wheels were packing down the surface in the right area such that with the right lighting angle was causing those tracks to reflect a higher albedo resulting in the appearance of light tracks. The traverse to Station 1 is (or will be) a good example of light (high albedo) tracks. Almost all of the traverse to Station 1 and back is visible in the LROC imagery, yet for EVA 2 this whole southern traverse barely shows any rack visibility.&quot;
143:36:06||alsj|&quot;In regards to the great big skid then, I think what we can see is that the dark patch just to the right of the bottom white arrow in the LROC inset, represents the spray of dust that might have darkened or lowered the albedo in that immediate vicinity. In other words we don't see the tracks but we do see the effect of the skid in terms of the dust that was sprayed out.&quot;
143:36:06||alsj|&quot;That being said, this particular LROC inset is probably one of the poorest example of visible tracks. However the first LROC inset south of Survey Ridge is a good example of both low and high albedo tracks which occur together over a distance of just 75 meters. There was no skid at this point but if memory serves John Young was reacting in a humorous way to the driving conditions at this point (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1435425" target="new" target="alsj">143:54:25</a>). To which Charlie says &quot;I love it...&quot; Anyway this is mostly speculation but partially based on the many hours spent staring at this wonderful imagery.&quot;
143:36:07||alsj|This is another reference to race car driver <a
143:36:29||alsj|As shown in Figure
143:36:30||alsj|Angular rocks are probably fresh ejecta, possibly from South Ray, while the rounded rocks are older and have been subject to more &quot;weathering&quot; due to micrometeorite impacts.  Charlie's observation that the dust-covered rocks are the rounded ones suggest that the dust covering may also have been due to the South Ray event.
143:37:25||alsj|They are near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BX.2/81.3</a>.

143:40:40|Jones|alsj|When did you get sprayed with dust?  When John made a sharp turn or when the back end broke out?
143:40:40|Duke|alsj|I don't remember.  But the dust came from the front wheel - just flipped up.
143:40:49||alsj|An example of a secondary crater - the product of a low-velocity impact by ejecta from an impact some distance away - is the crater just below the TV sunshade on the left side of AS16-110-

143:45:24||alsj|As was the case with the EVA-1 traverse, there are scarps
143:46:07||alsj|The indicated location is roughly 50 meters from the track Brian McInall determined from the Hasselblad images and the DAC film.  This is the largest difference seen on this traverse.  One possible explanation is that Charlie's report of the coordinates was wrong.
143:46:40||alsj|Brian McInall identifies this boulder as one visible in his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LMtoStation4_17889-907.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">planimetric map</a> at BT.0/81.6, just beyond the plotted location of 17903.  John's laugh and tone of voice suggests that he isn't impressed by the size of the split boulder and, perhaps, wonders why Charlie would think it worth mentioning.
143:47:12||alsj|As shown on the
143:47:50|Jones|alsj|Did John have to pick his way around rocks?
143:47:50|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we had to pick our way through it.  It was a
143:47:50|Jones|alsj|Let me get an estimate of the average speed on this trip.  I don't imagine it was terribly quick through here.
143:47:50|Duke|alsj|Well, no; it wasn't.  You could compare...Let's see.  Just look at the times here.  At 46:07 we're 1.7/352 and at 48:35 we're coming up on 2.0/355.  So that's 0.3 km in (2 minutes 28 seconds)...That's pretty good. (7.3 km/hr).
143:47:50||alsj|They haven't been driving directly away from the LM and, making allowances for the changing azimuth, the average straight-line speed in this part of the traverse is 7.7 km/hr.  As indicated at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1435223" target="new" target="alsj">143:52:23</a>, their average speed over a longer portion of the drive on Survey Ridge is 7.1 km/hr.

143:50:21||alsj|John is adding to his comments back at 143:47:39.  He is probably referring to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../SchoonerCrater.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Schooner Crater</a>, which was produced by 31-kiloton nuclear explosive buried at a depth of 108 meters in layered volcanic rock.  The depth of burial was chosen to maximize the size of the resulting crater, 260 meters diameter and 63 m apparent depth.  The ejecta blanket has a very high concentration of blocks.  Schooner has long been recognized as an analog for lunar craters. As detailed in Phinney's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../PhinneySP-2015-626.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">document on astronaut geology training</a>, The Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17 crews all visited Schooner at various time between September 1970 and August 1972.

143:50:47||alsj|On the audio track track in Diego Trystero's  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STvUNSoIlsg" target="new" target="alsj">YouTube clip</a>, John's 'baddie' is heard at 19:39. In the video at that same point in the Trystero clip, a pair of nearly-identical craters can be seen at just inside the right edge of the DAC frame.  Brian McInall has identified this <a href="A16ThatWasABaddie.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">crater pair</a> in the traverse map.  Note that the time counter in Brian's screen grab reads 19:41, compared with 19:39 for exactly the same frame when watching the clip on YouTube with my iMac. Seven seconds later, at 19:46, the center of the image drops by about half the frame height compared with the adjacent frames, indicating that front of the Rover went into a crater, possibly at 143:50:47.
143:52:09||alsj|Although &quot;clicks&quot; is usually used as shorthand for &quot;kilometers per hour&quot;, here Charlie means two clicks of the range indicator or 0.2 kilometers.

143:52:09||alsj|They are near the location where Charlie took AS16-110-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17912" target="new" target="alsj">17920</a>

143:52:37||alsj|During their second EVA, the Apollo 17 crew crossed a contact between a dark mare surface and the fringe of an avalanche outflow.  From orbit, the albedo change is dramatic but, on the ground, the change is very subtle and shows up, primarily, in the brightness of the inner walls of small, fresh craters.
143:54:45||alsj|They are about midway between the AS16-110-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17926" target="new" target="alsj">17926</a> and 17927 locations. On the way back down the mountain, they will do Station 6 about 200 meters west of 17927, at about BL.8/80.8.
143:54:45|Jones|alsj|Did you spend a fair amount of time in the air because of the bumps?
143:54:45|Duke|alsj|It was like you were in slow motion as it bounced, because of the one-sixth gravity.  I mean, we didn't spend a lot of time in the air, but you had that springy feeling that was more a slow motion (and) slower frequency because of the light gravity.  And I think the suspension system was, probably, lighter than you would have down here.  We called it bouncing, but we really weren't bouncing.  Occasionally, the wheels would come off; but we'd just oscillate, really.
143:54:45||alsj|The 16-mm movies Charlie took of John's Grand Prix drive give an indication of the ride, albeit at larger amplitude because Charlie wasn't on board.
143:55:30||alsj|John grew up near Orlando, Florida - long before Walt Disney World made the area a tourist mecca.  The highest natural elevation in Florida is only 345 feet (105 meters).  In the Orlando area, there are no natural elevations anywhere near that high.

143:56:26|Duke|tech|Going upslope, the pitch meter needle was working and it was pegged at the top.
143:56:26||alsj|This indicates they were climbing more than a 20-degree slope.
143:56:26|Young|tech|Charlie said it was pegged and I said, 'Oh, Charlie'.  I didn't believe this.  I didn't feel as if I had a sensation that it had been pegged.

143:57:54||alsj|The planned Station 5 location is at a range/bearing of 3.3/358 relative to the planned landing site at CA.0/81.0,  so the planned Station 5 location was BK.5/81.6.  However, Charlie seems to be ignoring the fact that they actually landed at CB.1/80.5.  John and Charlie know that the decision about exactly where they stop to do Station 5 will be theirs to make on the trip back down the mountain.

144:05:54|Duke|alsj|(Looking at the picture) Looks like we've just driven up the thing and just turned around.  I remember that, up on the side of Stone Mountain.  We came up and made a turn - really impressive - and then started back down a little bit.  We were trying to find a bench that we could work on.  And then we ended up pointing the Rover almost like northwest.

144:06:56||alsj|The idea is to overturn and collect some of the soil that was underneath it.  Presumably, that soil has been shielded from cosmic rays and the solar wind for as long as the rock has been in place and a comparison with nearby surface soil would yield information of soil/solar wind interactions.
144:06:56||alsj|At about this point, Charlie takes his last traverse photo, AS16-110-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17946" target="new" target="alsj">17946</a>.  Note the large number of blocks and the Rover tracks coming uphill.  Charlie's pan taken at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta4.html#1445625" target="new" target="alsj">144:56:25</a> shows the tracks John is making as he drives downhill to the place where he will park the Rover.
144:07:26||alsj|Jones - Does this mean that John's getting the wheels up on...&quot;
144:07:26|Duke|alsj|Up on some of the blocks, yeah.  If I remember, they were more subdued blocks, though.  I mean, it wasn't a boulder sticking up a meter, but the width and breadth of the block was a meter.  It wasn't any problem.  That car just really moved over all that kind of surface.  I think we were probably ten or twelve inches off the surface - that's how much clearance we had.  Maybe a little bit more than that.
144:07:26|Jones|alsj|14 inches is the number that sticks in my mind.
144:07:26|Duke|alsj|Yeah, maybe.  So the rock couldn't stick up more than 14 inches or we'd drag the bottom - like we did a couple of times.
144:07:26||alsj|A bearing and range of 354/4.1 corresponds to a map location of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp269.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BG.8/82.7</a>, which is a position near the west rim of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Cinco 'b'</a>.  Analysis presented in the 1981 USGS Apollo 16 Proessional Paper, such as <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/SouthboundToStation4LROC - M175179080LR.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">McInall's map of the approach to Station 4</a>,  shows that they actually parked about 80 meters west of the center of Cinco 'a', or at about BF.9/82.5.  The difference between the indicated and actual locations is about 185 meters.  Note that they have driven about 5.2 kilometers in order to achieve a range to the LM of 4.1.  This is a higher ratio - or 'wander factor' - than many other Apollo Rover traverses and is due, in part, to the Survey Ridge excursion.
144:08:19||alsj|As is shown in
144:08:19|The following is taken from the Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|During the second EVA, the crew reported that the LRV pitch-attitude-indicator scale had fallen off.  The indicator provides a vehicle pitch reference between plus and minus 20 degrees.  The loose pitch scale did not impact the mission because the pointer for the indicator continued to work properly and the crew could adequately estimate the vehicle pitch from the pointer position.  The pitch-attitude-indicator scale is bonded to a bracket (Fig. 14-81) which is attached to the indicator case.  The scale is constructed of 2024T3 aluminum and the bracket is 6/6 nylon.  A comparison of the coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials indicate approximately a 4-to-1 ratio for nylon-to-aluminum.  With this expansion ratio, stress factors of safety for an ideal bond are 3 and 4 and temperatures of minus 100-degrees F and plus 250 degrees F, respectively.  Although a review of the bonding procedures did not reveal any problems, a flaw most probably existed in the bond, and this allowed stress buildup which caused the scale to become unbonded.  The crew experienced no difficulty in estimating the pitch angle after the scale became unbonded.  The back of the meter case must be machined off to gain access to the scale, and special handling permits must be obtained before working on the meter because of the radioactive materials within the case.  For these reasons, no hardware changes will be made for Apollo 17.
144:08:19||alsj|No problems were experienced with the Apollo 17 indicator.
144:08:26||alsj|As shown in Figure
144:09:24||alsj|During the second Apollo 15 EVA, Dave Scott and Jim Irwin stopped at a boulder at Station 6a on the flank of Mt. Hadley Delta but, because the boulder was on a slope of about 15 degrees and was resting on a very soft surface, they felt they were in a precarious position and only spent a few minutes before moving downslope to Spur Crater where they were able to park the Rover on a level spot on the downslope rim.
144:09:24|Jones|alsj|Did you have discussions with the 15 guys about working on slopes and parking the Rover.
144:09:24|Duke|alsj|I don't remember specific discussions; but I'm sure we did.  Those discussions probably influenced us about where to park.  We didn't want to park with the Rover on a steep slope because it's so hard to get out and to walk.  So we wanted to get a bench - a fairly level place to work.  If you're on a fairly level place, you can work pretty good.

144:12:39||alsj|TV on.
144:12:48||alsj|The TV camera is pointing more or less over the right front fender.  John is reading his checklist and Charlie is just off-camera to the left getting the 500-mm camera.  Some inbound Rover tracks are visible.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pans left.
144:13:02||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right to take his 500-mm shots.  Evidently, John decides not to dust the Rover.  Either that or he did the dusting while Charlie was aiming the high-gain.
144:13:06||alsj|Charlie does not take pictures of Stubby to start but, rather, starts with some pictures of  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16_lpi_trvrsmap.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">South Ray Crater</a>.  As can be seen in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Stubby pictures</a> described below, there are few shadows and, hence, little visible detail in the crater.]
144:13:06|Duke|tech|Stubby was a very old, subdued, tired-looking crater and it wasn't much but regolith.  I got pictures of Stubby, but there was no lineation, no evidence of outcrop, no evidence of anything except old, tired-looking things.
144:13:06|Young|tech|I got the feeling from looking at Stubby that it was there (meaning it was formed) after Descartes was because of the way the slope was off the mountain around Stubby.  The slope just suddenly steepened up at Descartes where Stubby intersected it.  That could be erroneous, but that's the only reasonable conclusion that I could come to.  The rim of Stubby bisected - or cut off - some of Stone Mountain.
144:13:06||alsj|One pre-mission hypothesis about Stone Mountain was that the mountain was a relatively recent volcanic construct.  If, however, an old crater like Stubby cuts into the mountain, the mountain must be very old.  The astronauts all received a great deal of training in the principle of &quot;superposition&quot; - what's on top of what - a key to determining the relative ages of geologic features.
144:13:06||alsj|John gets the gnomon from behind his seat and turns his back to us as he looks for an appropriate place to start sampling.  We get a glimpse of the opening in the thermal layer that allows water vapor to escape the sublimator.
144:13:06|Jones|alsj|The sublimator (opening) looks like it's covered.  With gauze or something so you don't get a lot of dirt in there.
144:13:06|Duke|alsj|That bottom one is a strap and you can see, right above that, there's a little line and that's just a light covering over it, I think.  See that line?
144:13:06|Jones|alsj|Maybe three or four inches below the top of the PLSS and two inches or so above the strap.
144:13:06||alsj|There is another opening in the thermal cover on the front of the PLSS behind the astronaut's neck.

144:14:24|Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message|alsj|You ask about the Backroom. I suspect my predecessor as P.I. for Apollo Field Geology, Gordon Swann, was the major hand in the design of the team that I inherited for Apollo 16-17.  He was also involved in the early Apollo Missions besides being P.I. for Apollo 14-15.  My team consisted of individuals who had done the same jobs on prior missions, so I had a well-trained team to start.  What an asset!!!
144:14:24||alsj|&quot;I sat at a table facing Jim Lovell - who was in charge of the Science Backroom - with Dale Jackson and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lee_silver.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lee Silver</a> - both brilliant geologists - on either side of me as my brain trust, who would offer advise as needed.  Behind me was Bob Sutton, who was generating a card file concerning each sample collected (material he used later in his work to orient as many samples as possible into their original lunar positions).  These cards were useful to me for quick review of what had been collected to that point - i.e. were there types of rocks that were being shorted in the sampling?  Off to the left was George Ulrich at a big table covered with the map of the landing site.  On it he kept track of the crew's position, list of tasks to be done at a given station, the times for when they arrived at the station and when they were supposed to leave for the next station.  All of this info was transmitted to the main mission control and put up on the big screens at the front of mission control.  Ours was the leftmost screen and thus was never seen on public TV.&quot;
144:14:24||alsj|&quot;When we wanted to send a message to the crew, we first had to convince Jim Lovell that it was important, then he would initial our note that was then placed under the TV that was over our map so that the CapCom could see it.&quot;
144:14:24||alsj|&quot;When Lovell called the Flight Director and he approved it, Flight then OK'd the CapCom to insert the message into the ongoing conversation whenever he felt that it wouldn't break a chain of thought.  Off to my right in front of an overhead projector was Tim Hait who kept notes in chronological order that were projected onto the wall so that, if we got involved in something and lost track of what was happening, we could look at the wall and see the time the note was taken and what was the geological subject.  There were also representatives of the lunar sample community behind who were people always pushing for their special requirements on sampling.&quot;
144:14:24||alsj|&quot;In another room we had a photogrammetry team who were involved with compiling Polaroid pictures from the lunar TV camera panoramas, annotating them for interesting rocks or geological features, placing these pans in front of me within minutes of when they had been taken, pointed out the features and we then tried to have the camera study these rocks when it wasn't deemed necessary to watch the crew.&quot;
144:14:24||alsj|&quot;We also had a team of court reporters who took the entire EVA transcripts, and furnished us with the printouts for use. They were available within days whereas the NASA transcript was months away.&quot;
144:14:24||alsj|&quot;In another room, we had a team of geologists whose only job was to watch the TV, listen to what was happening, phone us if they had any brilliant ideas that had escaped us, write up a summary of the EVA that was distributed throughout Mission Control before the crew had gone to sleep, and modify the pre-planned EVA coming up to fill in the sampling, photography, etc., that had been missed the first time. On Apollo 16, Dallas Peck - later to become Director, U.S. Geological Survey - and that team wrote a position paper on why EVA-3 could NOT be canceled and that the MAIN purpose of the landing was to get to North Ray crater because it gave us a deep hole into the Descartes that could not be gotten anywhere else in the landing site.  The position paper was successful and we got a shortened but acceptable quick run traverse to North Ray.&quot;
144:14:24||alsj|&quot;So, that describes the main aspects of my team during the missions. A great bunch, all willing to work as long as needed to make sure that the job was done well.  I can never thank them enough; after all, the boss gets the credit, but its the team that did the job.&quot;

144:14:24||alsj|Fendell has continued his clockwise pan and we have a good view of the bright-white South Ray ejecta blanket.  The TV picture is not good enough, however, to show the dark streaks that John discusses in his next transmission.
144:14:52||alsj|John is probably referring to  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 3.6.2-3</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  John's hypothesis is probably not correct.  Analyses described in USGS Professional Paper 1048, &quot;Geology of the Apollo 16 Area, Central Lunar Highlands&quot; indicate that the bright rays are characterized by significantly higher concentrations of blocks (larger than about 2 cm) than the dark, inter-ray areas.  In addition, there are indications that very little of the ray material is in the form of fine particles.  Apparently, the dark, inter-ray areas are relatively devoid of South Ray ejecta.]</i></blockquote>

Fendell stops his pan every once in a while so that, as Bill Muehlberger described above, Polaroid pictures can be taken for use by the geology team in the Backroom.

144:16:50||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit.  Charlie has just put the 500-mm camera under the CDR seat.  John is in the background, probably taking the &quot;locator&quot; photos for his first sample.  He has already taken a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17443" target="new" target="alsj">17443</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17444" target="new" target="alsj">17444</a>, stepping to his right between frames.  He will collect the rock which is casting a shadow on the gray-scale gnomon leg.]

144:17:05||alsj|Charlie goes to the back of the Rover to get the rake.  John is getting a sample bag off his camera.
144:17:21||alsj|The Rover moves as Charlie tries to free the rake.  John bobs down onto his right knee to grab the sample.  He doesn't quite make it.  Fendell pans left.
144:17:38||alsj|In Houston, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new" target="alsj">Ed Fendell</a> agrees with Charlie's assessment.
144:17:58||alsj|Charlie goes around the back of the Rover to get the lens brush, probably from under the CDR seat.  Fendell stops his counter-clockwise pan and reverses direction.
144:18:16||alsj|Charlie rotates the TV camera counter-clockwise and dusts the lens.
144:18:50||alsj|This is sample 64435, a 1.08 kg breccia.
144:19:01||alsj|Fendell pans counter-clockwise.  As he goes by Ravine Crater, we can easily see the improved picture quality.]

144:20:10||alsj|As Fendell pans past the high-gain antenna mast, we get a good upslope view toward the rim of a 25-meter crater where John and Charlie will do some sampling before they leave Station 4.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-33.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-33</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> and Figures 3 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpapD4f3.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">82k</a> ) and 4 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpapD4f4.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">55k</a> ) from the Stone Mountain chapter ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/D4-Stone Mountain.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">5.7 Mb PDF</a> ) in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">USGS Professional Paper 1048</a>.

144:20:18|Duke|alsj|It doesn't look so steep, but it's steep!&quot;]
144:20:18||alsj|Charlie may be using a two-footed hop, although it seems more likely that he is using a variant of his skipping stride, leading with one foot as he hops up the slope.
144:20:18||alsj|Fendell stops the counter-clockwise pan a bit short of the limit and reverses direction.
144:20:18||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun 'before' is AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17947" target="new" target="alsj">17947</a>.  John's shadow is to the left, and he is taking a cross-Sun stereopair: AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17448" target="new" target="alsj">17448</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17449" target="new" target="alsj">17449</a>.] </i></blockquote>
144:20:55||alsj|Charlie's &quot;locator&quot; for the rake site is AS16-110-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17948" target="new" target="alsj">17948</a>.  Note that the right-rear Rover wheel is off the ground.
144:21:37||alsj|That is, they are breccias with a dark matrix and light-colored clasts.]</i></blockquote>
144:22:34||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and finds John and Charlie working about 10 meters behind the Rover.
144:22:55||alsj|John backs away to get a cross-Sun 'after', AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17450" target="new" target="alsj">17450</a>.  Charlie seals the sample bag  and then gets ready to collect a soil sample with the rake.]</i></blockquote>
144:23:08||alsj|John gets a sample bag ready and Charlie lifts a load of soil with the rake.  The bag is backlit and as, Charlie pours, we can see the soil tumble into the bag.
144:23:08||alsj|In Houston, Flight Director Pete Frank is told that John has been in Minimum cooling for a long time and needs to increase his cooling rate.]</i></blockquote>
144:23:22||alsj|Charlie gets and pours another load of soil.  This is an excellent TV picture of soil pouring.]</i></blockquote>
144:23:45||alsj|John seals the bag while Charlie stows the rake on the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
144:23:58||alsj|John joins Charlie at the back of the Rover.  Normally, Charlie would have been standing by so John could put the sealed bag in his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
144:24:10||alsj|Charlie turns and presents his SCB.
144:24:18||alsj|John puts the rake-soil sample in Charlie's SCB.]</i></blockquote>
144:24:36||alsj|John will now collect samples while Charlie uses a device called the penetrometer to determine various mechanical properties of the soil.  The instrument is shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-1</a> in the Preliminary Science Report and consists of a reference plate which Charlie presses on the ground and then pushes a rod through the plate into the soil.  The rod can be fitted with cone-shaped tips of various sizes and, as he pushes, the force he has to use is recorded on a drum.  Charlie's next transmission suggests that he was supposed to make measurements on one of benches seen in pre-mission overhead photos of Stone Mountain and then on the slopes on either side of the bench.]</i></blockquote>
144:25:20||alsj|John gets the gnomon from the rake site and goes off-camera to the right.  Charlie is at the back of the Rover and is probably assembling the penetrometer.]</i></blockquote>
144:25:37||alsj|John takes a series of four &quot;before&quot; pictures of the sample.  Frames AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17451" target="new" target="alsj">17451</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17452" target="new" target="alsj">17452</a> are a cross-Sun stereopair while <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17453" target="new" target="alsj">17453</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17454" target="new" target="alsj">17454</a> are a down-Sun stereopair.]</i></blockquote>
144:26:24||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the left so he can put his camera on the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>
144:26:33||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds Charlie; but Charlie promptly goes off-camera to the right.  Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>
144:26:41||alsj|Pre-mission thinking about the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp009.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 16 site</a> suggested that the Stone Mountain bedrock was different from the rock underlying the Cayley Plains.  As mentioned previously, there were expectations that John and Charlie would find volcanic rocks on the mountain and what Houston is looking for, here, is a fresh crater large enough to have dug down into that bedrock.  Although it was not known beforehand whether or not there would be significant amounts of South Ray ejecta on the mountain side, John and Charlie have been unequivocal in their statements that there are, indeed, many pieces of South Ray ejecta present.]
144:26:41||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the back of the Rover, still assembling the penetrometer.]</i></blockquote>
144:27:07||alsj|Charlie slides the reference plate toward the tip of the penetrometer rod.]</i></blockquote>
144:27:19||alsj|John approaches the back of the Rover.
144:28:24||alsj|Charlie gets the other set of tongs off the back of the Rover.  The area where he dropped the penetrometer cone is hidden from view by the Rover, but we can see that he uses the tongs to get the cone and then raises the tongs high enough that John can grab the cone.]
144:28:24|Jones|alsj|This is the first time that either of you has used the tongs.  Did your start to use them here because of the slope or the number of rocks?  You'll use them pretty regularly from now on.&quot;]
144:28:24|Duke|alsj|I guess it was just time (to start using them).  And I dropped that penetrometer head on to the ground and tongs were perfect to pick that up; so we broke those out.  And John was over sampling by himself and so he decided he needed a set.  So we started using them at this point.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
144:28:59||alsj|Charlie circles behind John and goes to the CDR seat where, at some point, he had put the penetrometer.
144:29:16||alsj|John and Charlie are near the left rear fender as they work on the penetrometer.  John was facing north while he described the glass splatter.
144:29:41||alsj|John's cross-Sun 'befores' of the glass splatter are AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17455" target="new" target="alsj">17455</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17456" target="new" target="alsj">17456</a>.  Note that he has planted his tongs while he takes the picture and gets a sample bag ready.  He is working at the back of the Rover near the right rear wheel.]
144:29:41||alsj|Charlie re-positions the reference plate on the penetrometer and goes off-camera to the right.
144:30:00||alsj|This is sample <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16samp64455.html" target="new" target="alsj">64455</a> a 57 gram &quot;glass-coated metaclastic&quot; rock.]
144:30:00||alsj|Fendell starts panning counter-clockwise.
144:30:05||alsj|As shown in Figure 18 from  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">USGS Professional Paper 1048</a>, the South Ray impact may have penetrated, first, a 10 to 15 meter layer of regolith, then a 50 to 60 meter layer of dark breccia, and, finally, a layer of light-colored rock, possibly an old layer of impact melt.]</i></blockquote>
144:31:22||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie south of the Rover.  He is well above the Rover and, apparently, has just started running downslope on the way back from his first measurement site.  He moves easily using his skipping stride.]
144:31:22|Jones|alsj|Did you feel that you had good stability?
144:31:22|Duke|alsj|Yeah; that was the most comfortable (stride) for me.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
144:31:40||alsj|Fendell pans to follow Charlie but stops when John comes into view.  John is using the tongs to collect a number of small rocks. Although he has his back to us, it is evident that he has a sample bag in his left hand and is having no trouble putting the rocks in with the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
144:32:04||alsj|During the preceding conversation between Charlie and Tony, John used to tongs to tip a hand-sized rock upright so he could get the tongs around a narrow dimension of the rock.  He then raised it without difficulty.]
144:32:04||alsj|The Rover moves, probably because Charlie is changing tips on the penetrometer.]
144:32:04||alsj|John takes a couple of steps backward as he seals the sample bag.  This suggests a high level of confidence in his ability to move around this rock-strewn area.]</i></blockquote>
144:32:24||alsj|Frame AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17457" target="new" target="alsj">17457</a> may be an &quot;after&quot; of this sample site.  The samples are 64475 to 64478, of which 64475 is the largest, a 1.03 kg breccia.  As shown in Figures 41b and 41c from USGS Professional Paper 1048, these samples have been identified in AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17453" target="new" target="alsj">17453</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17454" target="new" target="alsj">17454</a>, which are the down-Sun 'befores' John took of the angular rock he collected at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1442557" target="new" target="alsj">144:25:57</a>.]
144:32:24||alsj|Charlie comes into view with the penetrometer and John heads for the LMP's side of the Rover.
144:32:48||alsj|Charlie is suggesting that craters with significant numbers of surface rocks on this part of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Stone Mountain</a> have been dug by South Ray ejecta and that they want to find a crater without rocks in hope that the South Ray contamination will be less.]
144:32:48||alsj|During the mission review, Charlie commented on the fact that the Apollo crews visited only six sites of the Moon and that none of the crews had time to do a definitive of even those small areas.]
144:32:48|Duke|alsj|Trying to figure out the Moon with what we're doing in Apollo is like having one drop of water to study out of the whole Pacific Ocean, really.&quot;]
144:32:48|Jones|alsj|Just a few clues and hints to the general picture.
144:32:48||alsj|Charlie turns his back to the Rover and, as Fendell gets him centered, he pushes the penetrometer into the ground with his left hand.  Gradually, he sinks to his knees and then bounds forward to regain his balance.  Only the recording drum is above the surface.]</i></blockquote>
144:33:16||alsj|Charlie bobs down onto his right knee, holds his position long enough to get the recording drum with his right hand, and pulls the penetrometer out of the ground as he rises and runs forward.]</i></blockquote>
144:33:22||alsj|Charlie pulls the reference plate down to the end of the rod.]</i></blockquote>
144:33:41||alsj|Charlie adjusts the recording drum.
144:33:51||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right and Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>
144:34:15||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie as he gives the penetrometer a final push.  About a half-meter of the rod is sticking out of the ground.  The southern part of the South Ray ejecta blanket is in the background.]</i></blockquote>
144:34:28||alsj|Charlie pulls the penetrometer out of the ground and shakes some dust off.]</i></blockquote>
144:34:42||alsj|Charlie resets the reference plate and the recording drum and moves off-camera to the right.  Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>
144:35:02||alsj|The size of ejecta fragments are largest near the rim of a crater and become smaller with distance.  The blocks at this site which seem to be South Ray ejecta are of a certain size and Charlie is speculating that a crater showing only blocks of a noticeably smaller size might not be contaminated.]
144:35:02||alsj|As mentioned following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta4.html#1440729" target="new" target="alsj">144:07:29</a>, they are about 80 meters west of  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Cinco 'a'</a>.]
144:35:02||alsj|As Charlie moves below the Rover, he angles across slope toward the northwest.  Fendell is only able to keep Charlie's PLSS in view.  He stops and Fendell is able to get him centered.]</i></blockquote>
144:35:24||alsj|Charlie is facing up slope, with the penetrometer slightly above him.  He leans forward and presses on the recording drum and, after encountering some resistance, he gets it in a few inches before it stops. He presses on the drum two more times, getting about half the rod into the ground in the process.  He then gives a final push and the rod sinks all the way into the ground.]</i></blockquote>
144:35:43||alsj|John is thinking that, as with the white soil they <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta1.html#1235059" target="new" target="alsj">uncovered with their boots</a> on the rim of Plum Crater, shocked/shattered soil may have been throw up onto Stone Mountain by the South Ray impact. By digging a trench, he might reveal a white layer or, at least, signs of layering underneath the surface layer.
144:35:43||alsj|As the penetrometer sinks into the ground on Charlie's final push,  he ends up balanced on his toes and his left hand, which is resting on the top of the drum.  He tries to run uphill to get his feet under him but, after vigorously treading regolith for a few seconds, he gives up and falls forward onto his hands.
144:35:51||alsj|Charlie pushes himself back and, once his torso is over his knees, he rises without difficulty.
144:36:10||alsj|While facing upslope, Charlie bobs down to his right knee and retrieves the penetrometer.
144:36:44||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of his trench, AS16-107-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17458" target="new" target="alsj">17458</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17459" target="new" target="alsj">17459</a>.]
144:36:44||alsj|Charlie moves upslope toward the back of the Rover and uses a slow, hopping sidestep.  He advances the recording drum and then taps the penetrometer several times to loosen the dust he kicked onto it.  Fendell follows.
144:36:44|Duke|alsj|I wasn't sinking in too far.
144:36:44|Jones|alsj|No.  The toe on the uphill side isn't penetrating not more than an inch and a half.
144:37:06||alsj|As Charlie pushes the penetrometer into its stowage slot at the back of the Rover, we see the whole vehicle move and, in particular, get a demonstration that the right rear wheel - the one behind the LMP seat - is off the ground.]</i></blockquote>
144:38:01||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of 'afters' of his trench, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17460" target="new" target="alsj">17460</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17461" target="new" target="alsj">17461</a>.  He then takes a down-Sun 'after', <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17462" target="new" target="alsj">17462</a>.]
144:38:01||alsj|Charlie takes the rake off of the extension handle and puts the rake down on the back of the Rover.  He will attach the extension handle to the upper core tube so he can drive the double core into the ground without leaning over too far.
144:38:24||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right to join John.  Fendell follows but reaches the clockwise pan limit before he finds them.]</i></blockquote>
144:38:35||alsj|Charlie will get the core sections out of John's SCB.]</i></blockquote>
144:38:35||alsj|John is referring to the extra SCB he got from under the LMP seat.  It also contains a couple of core tubes.  The rigidity they provide may be the reason the bag stands up nicely when John places it on the ground.]</i></blockquote>
144:38:35||alsj|The lower core tube sections have hardened bits so they can be hammered into the ground.]</i></blockquote>
144:39:20||alsj|Fendell begins to pan counter-clockwise.
144:39:20||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s72_38435.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-38435</a> shows Tony watching the action from the CapCom console.  The digital MET readout above and just to the right of his video monitor reads 144:39:17.  Deke Slayton is standing behind Tony; and Fred Haise, the backup Commander, is sitting just beyond Deke.]</i></blockquote>
144:39:52||alsj|The TV picture moves slightly throughout Fendell's pan, an indication that Charlie is working at the Rover.
144:40:59||alsj|Fendell finds John as he <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16v.1443918.mpg" target="new" target="alsj">makes his way upslope</a> out of the highly-eroded crater next to the spot where he parked the Rover. A screen grab shows John as he gets hear the upslope, southern rim at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16JohnClimbsCrater Wall.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">144:41:07</a>, which is about 1 min 49 seconds after the start of the TV clip.  David Harland has assembled a portion of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.1445716_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Station 4 pan Charlie</a> will take just before they leave for Station 5. This portion of the pan shows most of the highly-eroded crater, including Rover tracks made after John continued upslope before looping back to park where he did.  The tracks John made as he walked across the crater from the Rover and then climbed up to the southern rim are clearly visible. A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16McInallJohnsClimb.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">labeled version</a> of Brian McInall's Station 4 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_EVA_2_STA_4_Planimetric_Map-LROC_M175179080LR_Feb_2018.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Planimetric map</a> shows the approximate point where John reach the rim and, then, continued on the 25-m crater where he planned to do some sampling.  
144:40:59||alsj|Charlie crosses the TV picture from left to right with the core tube while, in the distance, John approaches the rim of the 25-meter crater south of the Rover.  As indicated in Figure 4 from the Stone Mountain chapter of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">USGS Professional Paper 1048</a>, he will stop about 75 meters from the Rover.
144:42:04||alsj|Houston is looking for Stone Mountain bedrock and not South Ray ejecta.  A secondary crater, dug by relatively-low-velocity South Ray ejecta, is unlikely to show much bedrock, if any.]</i></blockquote>
144:42:34||alsj|Fendell zooms in on John and follows him as he turns to his right and moves in a westerly direction.]
144:42:34||alsj|John is saying that the rocks on the side of the crater opposite South Ray are likely to be the South Ray ejecta while the rocks on the side toward South Ray might not be.  In a few minutes, he will take a  pan from the rim of the crater.  Frames AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17473" target="new" target="alsj">17473</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17485" target="new" target="alsj">17485</a> show the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta4crater_pan.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">crater</a> and a pile of blocks on the inner, northeast wall.  This wall is on the side directly opposite South Ray and the blocks are probably South Ray ejecta which came in at a relatively low angle.]</i></blockquote>
144:42:47||alsj|A primary impact is one by a high-velocity projectile coming in from elsewhere in the solar system.  A typical impact velocity would be 20 to 30 km/s, rather than 1 to 2 km/sec in the case of a secondary impact.  In a primary impact, the projectile is usually vaporized and, if the crater is large enough, blocks on the rim are likely to have been dug up out of the bedrock.  The nearest large crater that is likely to be a primary is probably <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.site-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Crown</a>.
144:42:47||alsj|The core sections are each 42 cm long.  See Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">15</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy16.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">16</a> in Judy Allton's Apollo Toolbook.

Note that he is hitting the core with the flat of the hammer.  Note, also, that a member of the support team is standing behind him, holding a hose carrying chilled water to circulate through Charlie's Liquid-Cooled Garment (LCG).]</i></blockquote>
144:43:31||alsj|John stops and puts the gnomon down.  He is well above the Rover and makes a striking silhouette against the black sky.]</i></blockquote>
144:43:47||alsj|Charlie's &quot;before&quot; photos are a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17949" target="new" target="alsj">17949</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17950" target="new" target="alsj">17950</a>, and a 'locator', <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17951" target="new" target="alsj">17951</a>.]
144:43:47||alsj|As indicated in the dialog at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1445201" target="new" target="alsj">144:52:01</a>, John has the scoop with him.  He plants it and then puts the spare SCB down as well.  Fendell pans right, probably looking for Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
144:44:27||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie.  He is standing north of the double core and is hitting the top of the extension handle left-handed.  He is looking southwest in the general direction of South Ray.  He stops hammering.]</i></blockquote>
144:44:56||alsj|Charlie steps in close to the extension handle, nearly straddling it, and pulls the core out with both hands.  It sticks for a moment and then comes out easily.  During John's next transmission, Charlie inverts the core tube so the soil won't run out and then sidesteps slowly up the slope toward the Rover.  Fendell follows.
144:44:56||alsj|At some point, John takes a down-Sun stereopair of the gnomon and the area where he will collect a soil sample.  These photos are AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17463" target="new" target="alsj">17463</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17464" target="new" target="alsj">17464</a>.  In the latter frame, note the core tubes which are stowed in pockets in the extra SCB that John has placed on the ground to receive individual sample bags.  At various times during the mission, both John and Charlie commented on the need for a handle on the SCB that would stick up, as on some grocery sacks, and make it easier to manipulate.]</i></blockquote>
144:45:02||alsj|John is suggesting that he climb down into the crater and scrape soil off part of the wall to try to find bedrock.  If the crater depth is greater than the regolith depth, there would be a bench partway down the inner wall that would mark the regolith/bedrock boundary.]
144:45:02||alsj|Once he gets to the Rover, Charlie lays the core across the back of the Rover, takes his camera off so he can put it on the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>
144:46:03||alsj|Charlie is now at the back of the Rover and Fendell starts a counter-clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
144:47:16||alsj|John's assumption is that, while the area is liberally sprinkled with fragmental ejecta from South Ray, there is little fines material from that source.  Analyses in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">USGS Professional Paper 1048</a> supports this hypothesis.  He takes a down-Sun &quot;before&quot; stereopair, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17463" target="new" target="alsj">17463</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17464" target="new" target="alsj">17464</a>.]
144:47:16||alsj|Fendell finds John at about the same place he was when we last saw him.  Fendell zooms in.]</i></blockquote>
144:47:42||alsj|John drops sample bag 400 in the extra SCB.]</i></blockquote>
144:47:51||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of 'afters', AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17465" target="new" target="alsj">17465</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17466" target="new" target="alsj">17466</a>.  Not surprisingly, the scoop is not in the same position as in the 'befores'.]</i></blockquote>
144:47:59||alsj|John turns to face down-Sun.
144:47:59||alsj|John starts his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1444800.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Station 4 pan</a>.  By the time he starts his next transmission, he is facing the Rover.  In taking most of the pictures, he bends his knees, arches his back, and gets up on his toes so he can aim the camera at the horizon.  The best TV sequence of an astronaut taking a pan is probably the one showing Jack Schmitt taking a pan at Apollo 17's Station 3.]
144:47:59||alsj|This first portion of John's pan includes frames AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17467" target="new" target="alsj">17467</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17472" target="new" target="alsj">17472</a>. ]

144:47:59||alsj|In frame  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17472" target="new" target="alsj">17472</a>, Ravine Crater is the large impact feature on the lower slopes of Smoky Mountain.]
144:47:59||alsj|David Harland has assembled the portion showing  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.1444800_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Smoky Mountain, North Ray Crater, the Rover, and the SCB</a>.]</i></blockquote>
144:48:30||alsj|John has completed about 3/4 of the pan, including all of the crater.  These pictures are AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17473" target="new" target="alsj">17473</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17479" target="new" target="alsj">17479</a>.]
144:48:30||alsj|Frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17473" target="new" target="alsj">17473</a> shows Charlie working on the core at the back of the Rover.
144:48:30||alsj|In frame  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17474" target="new" target="alsj">17474</a>, the Rover is at the left side.  The SCB that John brought with him to hold individual sample bags is in the foreground. Charlie is at the back of the Rover.  Note the footprints that John made as he made his way up to the Station 4 crater.]
144:48:30||alsj|Frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17477" target="new" target="alsj">17477</a> shows a large amount of debris uphill of John's sampling location at the Station 4 crater.
144:48:30||alsj|Frames <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17478" target="new" target="alsj">17478</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17479" target="new" target="alsj">17479</a> show the central portion of the 25-m crater.  Note that there is very little debris on the western (right) side of the crater.
144:48:30||alsj|As John just noted, this crater was almost certainly formed by a large piece of highly-shocked ejecta from South Ray Crater which plowed into the side of Stone Mountain at relatively low velocity and came apart.  Hence, this is a secondary crater.]
144:48:30||alsj|Next, John breaks the sequence of pan frames to get more complete coverage of the debris mound, possibly changing f-stops in the process.  In taking frame AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17480" target="new" target="alsj">17480</a>, John aims his camera down to show the mound of debris in the bottom of the crater. Then he turns to his left to get more complete coverage of the debris mound.]

144:49:06||alsj|John turns to his right, although not quite as far around as where he interrupted the pan, and adjusts the f-stop.  The final frames are AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17483" target="new" target="alsj">17483</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17489" target="new" target="alsj">17489</a>.] </i></blockquote>
144:49:12||alsj|Fred Haise is the Apollo 16 backup Commander.  The Apollo rake was developed by Caltech geologist Lee Silver.]
144:49:12|Duke|tech|Fredo gets a great big case of beer for thinking of that way to stow that rake on the back (of the Rover).
144:49:12||alsj|John finishes his pan and looks over the Rover toward the plains.]</i></blockquote>
144:49:39||alsj|Charlie is off-camera to the left, but we can see the shadow and he makes his way uphill to join John.
144:49:39||alsj|The Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center is 525 feet (160 meters) tall.  As shown in Figure 23 in the Stone Mountain chapter of  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">USGS Professional Paper 1048</a>, the elevation of Station 4 above the lunar reference surface is 7975 meters while Stations 8 and 9, which are at the base of the mountain, are at about 7800 meters.  As shown in Figure 3 in the Central Region chapter, the LM is at an elevation of about 7845.  Consequently, the altitude difference between Station 4 and the base of the mountain is about 175 meters - greater than the height of the VAB - while the LM-Station 4 difference is only 130 meters.
144:49:39||alsj|With regard to John's comment at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta4.html#1435531" target="new" target="alsj">143:55:31</a> about Florida being flat, the VAB is 180 feet taller than the highest hill in the entire state.
144:50:12||alsj|As can be seen in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">traverse map</a>, the planned landing spot was CA.0/81.0.  On the other hand, a point &quot;200 meters north of Double Spot&quot; would be near CA.6/80.6. Pan Camera frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4623</a> shows the actual landing spot 300 meters due north of Double Spot at CB.1/80.6  These difference are too small to be of operational significance, but it is interesting - and not surprising - that John knows the craters around the planned landing site well enough to make this determination from a distance of 4 kilometers and an elevation angle of only 1.9 degrees and without reference to a map.  The one thing that makes the identification possible is the fact that the surface near the LM slopes down to the south, dropping 50 meters in about 700 meters on a north-south line through the LM.  This increases John's apparent viewing angle from 1.9 degrees to about 6 degrees.  All of the Apollo commanders who intended to land at specific spots - this excludes only Armstrong - showed great professional interest in figuring out exactly where they landed.]</i></blockquote>
144:50:39||alsj|Charlie comes into view, carrying the rake.  He is hopping slowly up the slope, leading with his left foot.]</i></blockquote>
144:50:48||alsj|Charlie stops about two meters below John.]</i></blockquote>
144:51:01||alsj|Charlie wants to rake where he is, below the rim on the outer slope.]</i></blockquote>
144:51:05||alsj|John is standing on the rim and points to his feet to emphasize the point.  Generally, ejecta from the deepest part of an impact crater will land on the rim.  Charlie starts climbing again.]</i></blockquote>
144:51:10||alsj|John usually defers to Charlie with regard to sampling but in this case - probably because he has already spent several minutes looking at the crater and thinking about it - he is insistent.]</i></blockquote>
144:51:17||alsj|Charlie points at a small secondary with the rake.]</i></blockquote>
144:51:27|Duke|alsj|I think Moore was one of our geologists.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
144:51:48||alsj|John starts raking just inside the apparent rim.]</i></blockquote>
144:51:53||alsj|Charlie is apologizing for his coarse language, using &quot;mutha&quot;, meaning &quot;mother&quot; and short for &quot;motherf...er&quot;.
144:51:53|Duke|alsj|It was real steep.  I mean, it was real tough walking up there.  And right over that (rim), there's this crater on the other side that's real deep.  That's what we keep talking about; 'Don't fall in there.'  You can't see it in the TV, because the TV's below and you're looking sort of up at the rim.  But, on the other side, it was really steep.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
144:51:59||alsj|Charlie turns to his right, gets the scoop, turns back to face John, and plants the scoop to his left.  He then gets a sample bag off his camera.  Meanwhile, John is slowly dragging the scoop through the regolith.]</i></blockquote>
144:52:14||alsj|John holds the rake vertically and shakes the soil out.]</i></blockquote>
144:52:41||alsj|John starts a second swath.
144:52:54||alsj|John shakes the dirt out of the rake while Charlie examines the fragments they have already collected.]</i></blockquote>
144:53:38||alsj|According to USGS Professional Paper 1048, this rake sample contains 13 fragments - some of which are metaclastic rocks made of compacted regolith while others are breccias.]
144:53:38||alsj|After shaking the soil out, John raises the rake to make the third pour.]</i></blockquote>
144:53:44||alsj|Charlie seals the bag.
144:54:18||alsj|Charlie drops the sealed bag in the extra SCB, which is standing on the ground near his left foot.]</i></blockquote>
144:54:18||alsj|John's stereopair is AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17490" target="new" target="alsj">17490</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17491" target="new" target="alsj">17491</a>.  Note that neither the gnomon nor the extra SCB has moved since John took his pan.]</i></blockquote>
144:55:02||alsj|Charlie's &quot;All these blocks we see here&quot; seems to have made Tony think that Charlie was proposing to go down to the Rover to get the padded bags and then bring them back up to the crater rim.  As becomes clear in a moment, he meant &quot;here&quot; to mean Station 4 as a whole.]
144:55:02||alsj|In Houston, Flight Director Pete Frank and Backroom spokesman Jim Lovell are discussing strategy for <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp248.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Station 5</a>.]
144:55:02||alsj|Charlie leans on the scoop and reaches down to get the extra SCB.]</i></blockquote>
144:55:24||alsj|Charlie has started downslope, going directly toward the Rover.  He is on a cross-slope path and is using his skipping stride.  Every once in a while, he dislodges a fist-size rock, which then rolls two or three meters downhill before coming to rest in a depression.  John has gone toward the left, staying on the crater rim for a while before starting down.  When he does start downhill, he uses the loping, foot-to-foot stride.
144:55:51||alsj|Charlie has stopped to examine a half-meter, angular boulder, standing downslope of it to get a good look.
144:56:23||alsj|Charlie turns to look off-camera to the right toward  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16_lpi_trvrsmap.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">South Ray</a>.
144:56:38||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop, pushing it several times to make sure it is secure, and then hangs the extra SCB from the handle before starting the pan.  This action suggests that a standard part of the geology tool kit ought to be a stake with a hook at the top so that the stake could be planted at a sampling site with a bag hanging in easy reach.
144:57:15||alsj|Charlie has just taken the pan frame centered on the Rover.

144:57:21||alsj|As Charlie faces upslope, he has to get up on his toes, flex his knees, and lean way back.
144:58:02||alsj|The complete <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1445649.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Station 4 pan</a> has been assembled by Dave Byrne.  By starting the assembly with the down-Sun frame and ending with another, the effects of Charlie's change in position while taking the pan are minimized.
144:58:02||alsj|Charlie pulls the scoop out of the ground and gets the SCB off the handle.  However, in the process of transferring the SCB to his right hand, he drops it.  Fortunately, none of the sample bags fall out.]</i></blockquote>
144:58:14||alsj|Charlie moves downslope of the bag so he can grab it without having to get to his knees.  This is a graphic illustration of the steep slope.
144:58:20||alsj|As Charlie skips off-camera to the left, Fendell starts a clockwise pan.
144:58:20|Jones|alsj|You didn't seem to have any trouble adapting to the hillside.&quot;]
144:58:20|Duke|alsj|That was tough.  That was a tough stop.  But, I mean, you just do it.
144:58:20|Jones|alsj|There's a great deal of inventiveness here in getting things done.
144:58:20|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Well, you know, it's simple physics, really. 'I'd better get downslope for this one.'  Those kind of things.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
144:58:23||alsj|Fendell zooms in on South Ray Crater and, although the resolution is poor compared to  Hasselblad images such as <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18245" target="new" target="alsj">18245</a>, we can make out the rim crest all the way around and see the inner walls on the south and west sides.]</i></blockquote>
144:59:05||alsj|sic that we didn't run across any white soil may be significant around here. (Pause)
145:00:22||alsj|Fendell is panning slowly north along the South Ray ejecta blanket, stopping every half frame width so that people in the Backroom can take pictures of the video monitor.]</i></blockquote>
145:01:03||alsj|Fendell is now looking at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Baby Ray Crater</a>, still at maximum zoom.]</i></blockquote>
145:01:29||alsj|TV off.
145:01:48||alsj|As Charlie mentioned at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta4.html#1435859" target="new" target="alsj">143:58:59</a> as they passed the crater on the way to Station 4, the crater was at a bearing and range of 354/3.4.  Station 4 is at a bearing and range of 354/4.1.
145:03:10||alsj|Charlie is afraid that any blocky-rimmed crater will be showing South Ray blocks whereas the Backroom is hoping that John and Charlie will be able to find a blocky-rimmed crater that has brought up Stone Mountain bedrock (the Descartes formation), much like Spur Crater brought up bedrock on the flank of Mt.

145:05:33|Young|tech|Travel to Station 5 was downhill all the way with the brake on.  Driving downhill, I did it with idle power and sometimes put on the brakes.  That's all we had to use.  I wasn't going too fast, maybe 4 or 5 kilometers (per hour).  On a straight stretch (meaning 'level'), (we) might get up to 10.  But coming up to a ridge, I'd slow back down 'cause I had no idea what kind of slope was on the other side of that ridge.  You sure can tell that, if you let that rascal loose, she'd go down that hill in a big hurry.
145:05:33||alsj|&quot;When you got the Rover up to about 10 clicks going down a hill, it's just like riding a sled on ice.  No matter which way you turn the wheel, the thing's going straight.  I mean, it'd be sideways, but still going in a straight line downhill.  Lot of mass there.&quot;
145:05:33||alsj|During the drive to Station 5, Charlie takes AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17975" target="new" target="alsj">17975</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17990" target="new" target="alsj">17990</a>.

145:07:43||alsj|This is a reference to a pre-flight dream of Charlie's in which he and John encountered vehicle tracks during the drive to North Ray Crater.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.landing.html#1042708" target="new" target="alsj">104:27:08</a>.
145:08:18||alsj|As can be determined from <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ppD4f23.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 23</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">USGS Professional Paper 1048</a>, John and Charlie are not going straight downhill but, even so, they drop in elevation about 100 meters over a distance of 600 meters.  This corresponds to an average descent slope of 9.5 degrees.  Parts of the traverse are, of course, steeper than this average.  In comparison, the average downhill slope of Stone Mountain in this area is 12.3 degrees.
145:10:08||alsj|Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ProfPaperD4f13-14.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">13 and 44</a> from <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16PP-D4-StoneMountain.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">chapter D4 from the USGS Apollo 16 Professional Paper</a> show the location of the Station relative to local craters (fig. 13) and a planimetric map of the Station (fig. 44).
145:10:08||alsj|Brian McInall has revised and elaborated the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_EVA_2_STA_5_Planimetric_Map-LROC_M175179080LR_Feb_2018.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Planimetric Map</a> using LROC image M175179080LR and the Hasselblad images taken at Station 5.  Note that the initial LRV paking place is indicated by a black rectangle.  In just a moment, they will decide to pick up the Rover and move it about its own width farther east  to the location indicated by the LVR icon.
145:11:03||alsj|The bearing to the LM of 353 and the range of 3.5 puts them near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp269.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BH.7/82.7</a>.  As indicated above, I believe they are 500 meters north of Station 4 and near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BJ.4/82.3</a>.  The difference is about 160 meters.  Figure 1 in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">USGS Professional Paper</a> shows a Station 5 location about 750 meters north of Station 4 and I believe that this is an error.  My main reason for this conclusion is the simple fact that the range to the LM indicated by the LRV Nav System has only decreased by 0.5 km and, although there are clearly errors in the bearing and range, there are no indications of changes this large over so short a distance during any of the Rover missions.  If my conjecture is correct, then the Station 5 crater is more likely to be the one at the bottom of Figure 13 in the Professional Paper, the crater which is bisected by the bottom of the image about 30 meters left of center.  Readers should note that I have assumed that Station 4 is, indeed, about 80 meters west of the center of Cinco A.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ppD4f23.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 23</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of the USGS Apollo 16 Professional Paper places Station 5 about 580 meters north of Station 4.
145:11:51||alsj|As indicated above John parked on a heading of 174.  Frame AS16-110-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18010" target="new" target="alsj">18010</a> suggests that they may have put it on a somewhat easterly heading.  Because they don't re-initialize the Rover Nav system before the leave for Station 6, the indicated Rover heading and the bearing to the LM will be off by the difference between the initial heading of 174 and whatever the heading was after they moved the Rover.
145:11:51|Duke|alsj|Like I always say, 'If you don't like your parking place, you just pick it up and walk off with it.'  It was easy to pick up.  I don't remember the details.  I'm trying to picture it in my mind; but, apparently, we parked and it was pointed down a slope and there was a little bench behind us, so we just picked it up and hauled it back.
145:11:51|Jones|alsj|One at either side at the midpoint?
145:11:51|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  You just get out, right where your seat was, and there was a handle on the frame.

145:11:51|Jones|alsj|Both hands on the handle?
145:11:51|Duke|alsj|I don't remember exactly, but I think both hands on the handle.  It was sort of like you could reach up and...There was a handle down there and, also, you could reach up under the chassis and pick it up - spread your hands apart a little bit, that gave you a little balance on the thing.  It was easy to do.
145:12:55||alsj|TV on.
145:13:29||alsj|The TV was at maximum zoom when John turned it off at Station 4 and, now, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom.  He is looking toward the northeast.

145:15:49||alsj|Tony is probably referring to the block concentration at Station 4.  Here, at Station 5, the few rocks that are visible are no more than fist size.

145:16:39||alsj|Fendell begins a counter-clockwise pan.
145:17:42||alsj|Ejecta from South Ray would impact at too low a velocity to create glass, although it could deposit glass created in the South Ray impact itself.  John and Charlie have commented on several rocks with glass coatings, which was probably acquired as the rocks were being dug out of South Ray.  A primary impact, on the other hand, usually will involve an impactor traveling 20 km/s or more and that is more than enough velocity to vaporize the impactor and melt some of the target material.  Most of the crews found and commented on small fresh craters with a puddle of glass in the bottom.]
145:17:42||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie.  As indicated in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ppD4f14.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 14</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>, they are collecting a first rake sample about 10 meters WSW of the Rover.  Charlie is standing between us and the gnomon and is in position to take a down-Sun, AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18019" target="new" target="alsj">18019</a>.

145:17:43||alsj|Even on the lunar mare, the regolith layer is 4 to 5 meters thick and a typical 0.5 meter crater will have dug down only 10 to 15 centimeters and will not have brought up bedrock.  It could, however, have punched through the South Ray ejecta blanket and have brought up samples of Descartes that were already buried in the regolith at the time of South Ray - if this small crater formed more recently than South Ray.]</i></blockquote>
145:18:16||alsj|Charlie has hopped up to the crater rim about ten meters beyond the gnomon and turns to face the Rover.  His locator is AS16-110-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18020" target="new" target="alsj">18020</a>.  In the foreground, John has done one swath with the rake and is shaking the dirt out.]</i></blockquote>
145:18:30||alsj|Charlie goes to the rim of the crater to get a bag out while John waits.  Note that John is standing a half meter or so below Charlie.  After getting the bag open, Charlie turns to his right and steps down onto the crater wall with his right foot and holds the bag low so John can pour.
145:19:44||alsj|Charlie has come down to John's level so he can put bag 332 in John's SCB.  In the meantime, John has turned the rake head 90 degrees and is ready to lift a soil sample.]</i></blockquote>
145:19:47||alsj|Charlie hops partway up the crater wall and gets a bag out for the soil.  John pours the soil without difficulty.]</i></blockquote>
145:20:22||alsj|John pours a second rakeful of soil.
145:20:25||alsj|Charlie spins the bag, folds the tabs, and puts the bag in John's SCB.  At some point, John takes AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17494" target="new" target="alsj">17494</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17495" target="new" target="alsj">17495</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:20:40||alsj|Clearly, Houston thinks they have not yet sampled the main crater at this site.  Charlie's prior description of it being a &quot;blocky rim&quot; crater at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1450841" target="new" target="alsj">145:08:41</a> probably led people in Houston to believe there is something more like the Station 4 crater in the immediate vicinity.]
145:20:40||alsj|Charlie hops backwards up to the crater rim.
145:21:02||alsj|John picks up the glass sample with the edge of the rake and holds out his right hand and drops it in.]</i></blockquote>
145:21:11||alsj|After examining the glass sample, John drops it to the ground and gets the gnomon.]</i></blockquote>
145:21:22||alsj|John has turned to look at the south wall of the crater.]</i></blockquote>
145:21:52||alsj|What John may be saying is that, if the main Station 5 crater is older than South Ray, the south wall would not have been struck by much South Ray ejecta, having been shielded by the rim.  However, during the Technical Debrief, he voiced a different hypothesis.]
145:21:52|Young|tech|It became apparent after we were at Station 4 that we weren't going to get what everybody thought was true Descartes, because we kept picking up what looked like South Ray ejecta.  The only way we could think to do it was to sample towards the South Ray side of the secondaries, or find a primary and sample there.  It just wasn't clear that any of those things (meaning the small craters they saw on the side of Stone Mountain) were primaries, because of the way those blocks were distributed in them.  They (meaning the blocks)'re all on the side away from South Ray.  Maybe there were a few primaries up there, but we sure didn't see any, did we?&quot;]
145:21:52|Duke|tech|No.
145:21:52|Young|tech|It makes you think that there's a lot of craters on the Moon that must be secondaries.  This is the first time that we've had a clear-cut example of it.  A lot of those craters on the Moon must be secondaries - as opposed to (high-velocity primary) impact craters, because they don't look any different except for the block distribution.  As many secondaries as the South Ray must have made in that region, it is sure clear there must be a lot of craters that are not primary impact craters.  I mean a lot.
145:21:52||alsj|Because this is a highlands site, the problem is distinguishing secondaries dug by South Ray ejecta and very old, eroded, primaries and secondaries.  All would be expected to have pieces of South Ray ejecta on the side away from South Ray.  The Apollo 14 crew also landed at a highlands site, but one without the complication of a young, nearby crater on the scale of South Ray.  Shepard and Mitchell encountered countless eroded craters that literally overlapped each other and most of these were probably very old.  I expect that many of the craters Young and Duke saw are also very old.
145:21:52||alsj|John walks around the inside of the crater to the west wall while Charlie walks toward the south, angling away from the rim, and then stops to look at a rock.
145:22:09||alsj|Charlie starts down into the crater to join John.  Before doing so, he reached forward with his right foot and planted a prominent footprint to mark the galls-covered rock.  He then moved sideways down onto the inner crater wall so that there would be no doubt about where he 'stopped walking'.  From the following dialog, I infer that John is not at the bottom of the crater but is on the wall, still well up from the bottom, although that fact is not obvious from the TV picture.
145:22:20|Duke|alsj|We're inside the crater.  We're inside the rim and, to the left, it went way down, deeper.  It just seemed too dangerous to try to get down there so we could get a down-Sun picture.
145:22:27||alsj|Charlie takes a cross-Sun &quot;before&quot; from the north and then hops to his right - upslope - to get a stereo companion.  These are AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18021" target="new" target="alsj">18021</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18022" target="new" target="alsj">18022</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:22:31||alsj|A fresh Crater which has penetrated through the regolith to bedrock will show a bench partway down the wall at a depth that corresponds to the base of the regolith.  The Apollo 12 and 15 crews saw a number of craters with benches on the mare.  As a crater is eroded by the constant rain of small impactors, the benches are worn away and covered.  Here, however, the lack of a bench is probably due to the fact that the crater is not large enough to have reached the regolith base.  Analyses present in USGS Professional Paper 1048 indicates that typical regolith thicknesses at the Apollo 16 site are 5 to 10 m, with the 12 meter depth determined with the active seismic (thumper) experiment being at the high end of the range.
145:22:56||alsj|John turns to his left, going halfway around to face Charlie.  As he turns, he stumbles slightly and his movements suggest he standing on a slope.  In addition, the soil he kicks in the general direction of the Rover clearly falls down a slope.]</i></blockquote>
145:23:12||alsj|John backs up to take two cross-Suns from the south.  These are AS16-107-17496 and 17947.]</i></blockquote>
145:23:29||alsj|John stands with his left side slightly upslope, bends his left knee until it is almost touching the ground and drags the rake through the soil.  Both this swath and the next one are below the gnomon and run in a north-south direction.  John then stands partway up and shakes the dirt out.]</i></blockquote>
145:23:35||alsj|John does another swath, this time without changing position.  He shakes the soil out.  Charlie comes downslope, diagonally, to join John.]
145:23:35|Jones|alsj|One thing I am always aware of in listening to the missions is constant stream of chatter at the geology station, really in all the missions, although particularly so in the J missions.  The notable exceptions are the 11 and 14 crews, so personality may play a big role; but I've wondered, too, if a factor in the talkativeness could have been the fact that your field-of-view was somewhat restricted in the helmet and you couldn't  always see each other.  Would there have been a tendency to talk more as a result of that?&quot;]
145:23:35|Duke|alsj|Well, I'm not conscious of that being the reason.  You're right; we had not only the normal visor - the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LEVA.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEVA</a> - that restricted some of the view, but then we pulled down these opaque sides on the helmet.  We had one that came down from the top and ones that came out from the side; and those were like putting blinders on!  I think the reason we talked so much is because we were just getting better at geology and we wanted to make good descriptions of what we were seeing.  To me it was just normal to talk.&quot;]
145:23:35|Jones|alsj|I'm glad you did!
145:23:59||alsj|Charlie takes the rake, gives the bag to John, and pours.]</i></blockquote>

145:25:54||alsj|John folds the bag to seal it, rather than spinning it.  Charlie turns to present his SCB but doesn't turn all the way to avoid facing downslope into the crater.  John goes diagonally upslope to get to the SCB.  At some point he takes a pair of 'afters', AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17498" target="new" target="alsj">17498</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17499" target="new" target="alsj">17499</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:26:11||alsj|John grabs the gnomon and heads up over the rim to the glass-coated rock Charlie noted earlier.]</i></blockquote>
145:26:22|Duke|alsj|It doesn't look steep, here; but we're on the inside of this rim and it was...See, as I try to get started, how I slip backward?&quot;]</i></blockquote>
145:26:35||alsj|John turns and comes back to the rim where he drops the gnomon.  Charlie gets a rakeful of dirt from the general area where they did the swaths.  He is standing just inside the crater rim.]</i></blockquote>
145:27:04||alsj|Charlie turns to face south, presenting his SCB to John.  The terrestrial weight of a bag full of soil is about one kilogram.]</i></blockquote>
145:27:22||alsj|Charlie hops part way up the crater rim and starts around it going counter-clockwise.  John follows.
145:27:50||alsj|Charlie stops on the south side of the crater.]</i></blockquote>
145:28:04||alsj|Charlie gets the gnomon from John and puts it down.  However, apparently he does not take any pictures]</i></blockquote>
145:28:18||alsj|John backs up to take a photo from the west, AS16-107-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17500" target="new" target="alsj">17500</a>.
145:28:23||alsj|What Charlie means is that the slope is going to make it impossible to take any pictures other than the one John is getting.]</i></blockquote>
145:28:29||alsj|John hops to his left to get a stereo companion, AS16-107-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17501" target="new" target="alsj">17501</a>.  He then steps back to his right and takes a third picture, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17502" target="new" target="alsj">17502</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:28:33||alsj|John bounds up to the rim and turns to take a locator.]</i></blockquote>
145:28:44||alsj|Apparently, John does not take a picture.
145:28:44|England, from a 1996 letter|alsj|We planned to use the camera to help guide the sampling.  We had seen features in the Apollo 14 pictures that we would have liked to have had sampled and hoped that we could use the TV to reduce the number of these misses.  In fact, we saw a few features that we asked about and that sometimes led to changes in sampling, but John and Charlie were such good observers that they didn't miss much.  The biggest advantage was that John and Charlie didn't have to spend much time explaining what they were doing.  I could stay ahead of them and have information ready when they needed it.  Using the TV, I could also prod the Backroom to think about some alternative strategies before the crew got to the point where a decision had to be made.  It also aided the thinking-out-loud periods when the crew and the ground were trying to interpret what the crew was seeing.  We didn't do too much of that, but there was some.  We were aware that if we proposed too strong of an idea about what they were seeing, we might bias their sampling too much toward a new hypothesis.&quot;]
145:28:44||alsj|&quot;While we wanted to take advantage of what was found to guide some of the sampling, we also wanted to ensure that they sampled systematically.  In the heat of the surface activities, it is easy to become captive of a new idea that wouldn't stand up too well under more careful thought.&quot;]
145:28:44||alsj|Charlie is standing far enough down the slope that the gnomon is at about waist level.  He reaches up with the rake and drags it a short distance through the soil near the gnomon.]</i></blockquote>
145:28:54||alsj|Charlie shakes the regolith out of the rake to see if he got any rocks.]</i></blockquote>
145:29:05||alsj|Charlie is hopping upslope sideways, leading with his right foot.  He makes only slow progress.]
145:29:05|Jones|alsj|Had you done any walking like this at a place like  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj_whtsands.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">White Sands</a> (National Monument near Alamogordo, New Mexico)?&quot;]
145:29:05|Duke|alsj|Not in the suit.  We did, just in shirtsleeves.
145:29:05|Jones|alsj|This looks very much like sidehill walking in that kind of stuff.&quot;]
145:29:05|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Well, you can see we're having a real problem here, maintaining our balance, getting started, and walking in a...You tended to go downhill, tend to slide down.&quot;]
145:29:05|Jones|alsj|Was there any particular problem in the inflated suit with having one leg lower than the other one?  Did it produce any stress on the legs?
145:29:05|Duke|alsj|No.  I don't think so.
145:29:10||alsj|Charlie steps on a little mound of soil, which crumbles under his weight.  He starts to fall forward and starts running in place, trying to get his feet under his center of gravity.
145:29:14||alsj|Charlie gets the rake planted on the ground and, using it for support, finally gets his body under control.
145:29:16||alsj|Charlie scoops up the rock.
145:29:28||alsj|Although Charlie was blocking our view, it appears that, when they tried to get the rock out of the rake, it started to fall and Charlie had to do a little juggling act - rather like the ones he did at Station 1 and 2 - before he could catch it.
145:29:34||alsj|John gets an individual sample bag off his camera.]</i></blockquote>
145:29:51||alsj|Charlie hands the rock to John and moves upslope toward the gnomon to do some more raking.]</i></blockquote>
145:30:12||alsj|As shown in Figure 48C in  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper 1048</a>, this sample broke after it was collected and arrived in Houston in four pieces, the largest being 108 grams.  The sample is a breccia and, according to the authors of the Professional Paper, is believed to be a piece of the Descartes formation, primarily for the reason advanced by the crew. Namely, it is more rounded than the likely pieces of South Ray ejecta collected at Station 4.]</i></blockquote>
145:30:13||alsj|Charlie completes a long rake swath and then shakes the dirt out.]
145:30:13||alsj|A breccia can, of course, contain crystalline inclusions.]</i></blockquote>
145:30:33||alsj|Charlie maintains his position, with his SCB on the uphill side, so John can stow sample bag 403.]</i></blockquote>
145:30:50||alsj|John continues counter-clockwise around the crater rim.  Because of the slope, he chooses to walk rather than run.  Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>
145:30:51||alsj|After following John and Charlie for a while, Fendell reverses direction and pans right to look at the last sampling site.  He aims the camera at the sample site long enough for someone in the Backroom to take a Polaroid picture of it and then pans left to find the crew.]</i></blockquote>
145:31:26||alsj|Charlie takes a cross-Sun stereopair of the gnomon from the north, AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18023" target="new" target="alsj">18023</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18024" target="new" target="alsj">18024</a>.  John is in a position to take an up-Sun.]</i></blockquote>
145:31:34||alsj|There is a fist-sized rock next to the up-Sun gnomon leg.   Charlie plants the rake on the surface just to the left of the rock and then, holding the top of the rake handle in his left hand, leans forward, almost to the point where his right knee touches the ground, and grabs the rock.  At this point, John takes up-Sun photo AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17503" target="new" target="alsj">17503</a>.  Charlie then pushes back on the rake and stands.  The sample <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LunarSampleCompendium65035.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">65035</a>, a 446-gram &quot;white matrix&quot; breccia which can be seen in Figure 46C in Professional Paper 1048.  John gets a sample bag off his camera and, during the following, steps in to get a better look at the rock as Charlie holds and describes it.]</i></blockquote>
145:32:19||alsj|Charlie twists his torso to his left just far enough that, by turning his head inside the bubble helmet, he can see the front of the Rover. John is putting bag 404 in Charlie's SCB.]</i></blockquote>
145:32:33||alsj|Charlie hops back slightly to get cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18025" target="new" target="alsj">18025</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:32:39||alsj|Charlie tries to hop upslope but has trouble making progress and runs in place, &quot;treading moondust&quot;, for a moment to keep his balance.]</i></blockquote>
145:32:49||alsj|Charlie does a shallow rake swath and then shakes the soil out of the rake.]</i></blockquote>
145:32:56||alsj|Charlie raises the rake to pour the sample into the bag John is holding open.  Charlie's next transmission suggests that, on this first swath, he only got one rock.]</i></blockquote>
145:33:00||alsj|Charlie does a second swath, closer to the gnomon, that starts well down slope from the top of the first swath.  In &quot;after&quot; photo AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18026" target="new" target="alsj">18026</a>, the first swath is the one on the far left and the second is the one on the far right.  As Charlie shakes the soil out, John turns and takes AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17504" target="new" target="alsj">17504</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:33:30||alsj|Charlie starts his third swath between the first two but only drags the rake a short distance before he starts over a little higher up slope.  Charlie drags the rake through the soil about a half meter and then it catches on a buried rock.  He then tilts the rake head to the left to free it and then continues the swath.]</i></blockquote>
145:33:33||alsj|John holds the bag as low as he can and Charlie pours.  By this time, John has probably already taken AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17505" target="new" target="alsj">17505</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:33:53||alsj|While John describes the large rock Charlie just collected, Charlie takes &quot;after&quot; photo AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18026" target="new" target="alsj">18026</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:34:16||alsj|This sample is probably 65315, a 300-gram breccia which is shown in Figure 50C in  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper 1048</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:34:22||alsj|John stows bag 405 in Charlie's SCB.
145:34:24||alsj|John turns and takes an &quot;after&quot;, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17506" target="new" target="alsj">17506</a> and then steps downslope to his left to take <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17507" target="new" target="alsj">17507</a>.  In the first of these, note that the rake marks were made after John took <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17505" target="new" target="alsj">17505</a>.  These marks may be just incidental marks made as Charlie walked a step or two to the east and moved the rake without lifting it completely off the ground.] </i></blockquote>
145:34:38||alsj|John gets the gnomon and then turns to look back to the west side of the crater.  Charlie is looking east.]</i></blockquote>
145:34:58||alsj|Charlie backs downslope several feet.
145:35:00||alsj|John starts walking clockwise around the inner wall of the crater.]</i></blockquote>
145:35:18||alsj|John walks upslope a few feet and Charlie follows, albeit with some difficulty.]</i></blockquote>
145:35:26|Duke|alsj|The regolith was loosely unconsolidated here, on the inner rim; and you can see as we try to go upslope, we're going in 3 or 4 or 5 inches.&quot;]
145:35:26|Jones|alsj|You're pushing with the uphill foot, trying to follow with the downhill.  This is very reminiscent of the work that Dave and Jim did in a 10-m crater below the Rover at their <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.sta6crtr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Station 6</a>.&quot;]
145:35:26||alsj|Facing upslope, John starts digging into the crater wall at a point about two meters clockwise and slightly upslope from the last gnomon position as can be seen from the location of the fist-sized rock just above the spot where John starts digging.  He uses the side of the rake - which is a solid surface - to get penetration and to move dirt.]</i></blockquote>
145:35:48||alsj|By this point, John has made 11 strokes with the rake.]</i></blockquote>
145:35:55||alsj|John stops after his fifteenth stroke.
145:36:07||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the footprints Charlie made climbing up to his present location.  Fendell is probably getting this view for the soil mechanics experts.]</i></blockquote>
145:36:19||alsj|Charlie is standing below John and to his right.  He puts the gnomon down to his left and starts walking uphill.
145:36:31||alsj|Charlie turns, backs up the slope, and nearly loses his balance.  John is now standing on the north side of the hole, facing it with his left leg downslope.  In this position, he is able to get down on his right knee.
145:36:32||alsj|It takes a bit of effort to get a sample from the bottom of the hole but, after several seconds, John stands and shakes the soil out.  Apparently he doesn't get many rocks.  He then runs the rake through the pile of dirt he removed from the hole.  The soil on top came from the bottom of the hole, so he is increasing his meager collection of buried rocks.
145:37:21||alsj|Charlie has a bag out and takes up a position down slope of the hole so that John can pour the samples easily when he is ready.]</i></blockquote>
145:37:54||alsj|Despite Charlie's next statement, there are three small rocks in the sample, 65925 to 927, which are shown in Figure 53B in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper 1048</a>.  All three are breccias.]</i></blockquote>
145:38:11||alsj|Charlie hands the bag to John and takes the rake.]</i></blockquote>
145:38:27||alsj|This is a reference to the fact that, while they have found rocks on the surface and down to a few inches, they haven't found many at depth.]
145:38:27|Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message|alsj|My understanding of this (part of the dialog) is based on the common scene in a desert setting.  The usual gravel-covered surface in the desert is a lag gravel - meaning that the infrequent rains have washed away all the fine particles (sand or finer) leaving an 'armor' of gravel at the surface.  This is sometimes called 'desert pavement'.  Someday, when you are on one of these surfaces, get out a shovel and dig through it. You will find a surface layer of coarse material covering a layer of fine material with the occasional rock. I assume that is what Tony was asking the crew.
145:38:27|England, from a 1996 e-mail message|alsj|Bill captured the meaning of my question, of course.  On Earth, if you have coarse material on a surface and fine material beneath, it got that way by winnowing - removal of the fine material.  To make a lag surface (most places) on the Moon, the coarse material was probably tossed in on top of the fine material.  Because the location (where John was digging) was on a slope, I was probably looking for a way that the fine material had worked its way down slope.  I was probably reaching a bit to even ask the question.  I might have done that as an hypothesis to get them to examine what they were seeing a little more closely.  It might also have been just a dumb question.
145:38:27||alsj|Charlie makes his way upslope to the south side of the hole.  He turns and goes up backwards the last step or two.
145:38:27||alsj|<a name="1453832">NASA</a> photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s72_38433.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-38433</a> shows Tony at the CapCom console.  Deke Slayton is seated beyond him and is talking to Fred Haise, the backup Commander, who is sitting behind Tony.  The digital readout above and slightly to the right of Tony's video monitor gives Mission Elapsed Time and is reading 145:38:32.  Note that Tony has a traverse planning map open on the desk next to the coffee cups.
145:38:37||alsj|Charlie digs into the bottom of the hole.
145:38:56||alsj|Charlie shakes the soil out of the rake.
145:39:11||alsj|John comes around the east side of the hole and Charlie turns to present his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
145:39:15||alsj|John stows bag 335 in Charlie's SCB.
145:39:20||alsj|Charlie had started to get a soil sample and then remembered that he had a rock in the rake.  He pours it into the new bag John is holding out.]</i></blockquote>
145:39:41||alsj|Charlie pours a rakeful of soil into the bag.]</i></blockquote>
145:39:56||alsj|Charlie gets more soil from the bottom of the hole.]</i></blockquote>
145:40:23||alsj|Charlie presents his SCB and John stows the soil sample.]</i></blockquote>
145:40:38||alsj|John takes AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17508" target="new" target="alsj">17508</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17509" target="new" target="alsj">17509</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:40:46||alsj|Charlie grabs the gnomon and starts counter-clockwise around the crater.  After a few steps, however, he decides to cut across the center of the crater to the Rover.  John continues around the wall.
145:40:49||alsj|Charlie goes down the slope with his body turned to his right, leading with his left leg.  He makes five steps with his left foot. Once he reaches the bottom of the crater, he switches to his skipping stride and is making good speed across the crater when he goes out of view to the right.]</i></blockquote>
145:41:03||alsj|Tony's phrase, 'plunging pretty steeply', could be a reference to possible geographic variations in steady state magnetic field or to possible time variations due to interactions with the solar wind.  According to the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, the field strength was 231 gammas at the ALSEP, 180 at Station 2, 125 gammas here at Station 5, 313 at Station 13 near North Ray Crater, and 121 at the final Rover parking place east of the LM.  Variations due to the solar wind were, in fact, less than about 5 gammas.  The field strength values Tony quotes here are the results of the first, rough analysis of the available data. Readers should note that, although the field orientation was similar at the three sites near the LM (ALSEP, Station 2, and Rover parking place), the field orientation at Stations 5 and 13 was dramatically different.  See Table <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrt12-ii.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">12-II</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.]</i></blockquote>
145:41:07||alsj|John has been angling upslope toward the crater rim, with Fendell following, and has now reached the level surface.
145:41:18||alsj|John is referring, of course, to the size of his Lunar boots.]
145:41:18||alsj|John reaches the Rover and goes out of view on the right side.  Fendell is looking more or less southeast toward the summit of Stone Mountain and starts panning left.]</i></blockquote>
145:41:39||alsj|John had not planned to do an LPM measurement at this site but, as shown on cuff checklist page  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR44-45.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-45</a>, he would normally take the LPM sensor out 48 feet on the right side of the Rover.  As shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ppD4f14.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 14</a> in the Stone Mountain chapter of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper 1048</a>, the Rover is parked on the northeast rim of the crater and pointed south southeast.  In going out from the right rear of the Rover, he will be going along to the crater rim.]</i></blockquote>
145:42:20||alsj|Houston is under the impression that no pans have yet been taken at Station 5.
145:42:26||alsj|Charlie comes into view at the CDR seat.  He is carrying the scoop.  The blade is fully extended, parallel to the extension handle. Frame AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17628" target="new" target="alsj">17628</a> shows the scoop head down in an angled sampling position during Station 6 activities.  Frame AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17544" target="new" target="alsj">17544</a> shows the scoop resting against a boulder at Station 8 is the same angled position.]</i></blockquote>
145:42:37||alsj|Fendell resumes his pan, just as Charlie goes out of view to the left.  Fendell stops his leftward pan and pans right to follow. Most likely, he had hit the button to do another three-degree, leftward pan increment just before seeing Charlie move and, although he responded quickly, the inherent delays in the system meant that Charlie was out of view before the camera started moving to the right.]</i></blockquote>
145:42:56||alsj|Fendell is now panning clockwise.
145:43:31||alsj|Evidently, Tony thought that John's 'mark' was the start of a measurement rather than the power-up of the sensor.
145:43:43||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie, who has his back to us.  He takes a step to his right, a clear indication that he is taking a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;before&quot; photos of his first sample.  These photos are AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18027" target="new" target="alsj">18027</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18028" target="new" target="alsj">18028</a>.  Charlie turns and goes off-camera to the left, probably to get a pair of tongs off the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
145:44:10||alsj|Fendell starts to pan left, just as Charlie returns with the tongs.  Fendell reverses direction to re-aim at the scoop, which Charlie had stuck in the ground before taking his pictures.]</i></blockquote>
145:44:48||alsj|Charlie picks up a rock with the tongs but then, as he tries to get the rock in his right hand, he drops it.]</i></blockquote>
145:45:12||alsj|Charlie has retrieved the rock and, after getting the rock in his right hand, plants the tongs in the ground so he can examine it.  He then gets a sample bag off his camera and bags the rock.
145:45:53||alsj|This is sample 65095, a 560-gram, white-matrix breccia show in Figure 49C in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper 1048</a>.
145:45:53||alsj|At about this time, John takes two LPM documentation photos.  He takes AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17510" target="new" target="alsj">17510</a> at the back of the Rover, but does not aim the camera high enough to actually show the instrument.  He then takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17511" target="new" target="alsj">17511</a> across the Rover seats.]</i></blockquote>
145:46:15||alsj|Charlie goes around the front of the Rover to the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>
145:47:21||alsj|Charlie returns to his sampling site and puts the extra SCB down near the tongs and scoop.
145:47:26||alsj|Charlie grabs the tongs and scoop and walks forward, awkwardly, a few steps before re-planting the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
145:47:51||alsj|John can see the characteristic glint of plagioclase crystals, a common component in the anorthosite rock that is believed to be a major component of the ancient lunar crust.]</i></blockquote>
145:48:04||alsj|Charlie turns down-Sun to face John, who is probably west of the Rover.
145:48:09||alsj|Charlie turns back to his work and takes a stereopair of &quot;before&quot; photos, AS16-110- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18029" target="new" target="alsj">18029</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18030" target="new" target="alsj">18030</a>.] </i></blockquote>
145:48:10||alsj|This is sample 65015, a 1.8 kilogram &quot;metacrystalline&quot; rock shown in Figure 44 in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper 1048</a>.  John is probably not wearing his camera and doesn't document the sample.  In the meantime, Charlie has picked up a rock about 5 cm across with the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
145:48:43||alsj|Charlie plants the tongs, gets a bag off his camera, and bags his small rock.  He then grabs the tongs to get another sample.  During John's next transmission, Charlie picks up a larger rock and tries to put it directly into the bag, but drops it.
145:49:24||alsj|The green tint suggests the presence of olivine.  Charlie retrieves the rock and bags it successfully.
145:49:26||alsj|The striations would suggest the rock is a breccia.  John is just being cautious in his classification.
145:49:26||alsj|The first rock Charlie collected is sample 65056, a 75 gram &quot;glassy agglutinate&quot; with crystalline clasts.  It is shown in Figure 47E in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper 1048</a>.  The second rock is 65055, a 500 gram crystalline rock shown in Figure 47D.  Both are believed to have been ejecta from South Ray.]</i></blockquote>
145:49:41||alsj|Charlie spins the bag closed and seals it.
145:49:51||alsj|Charlie picks up the SCB and stows the sample bag.  He then knocks the tongs over.
145:50:08||alsj|Charlie grabs the scoop and puts it in his right hand with the SCB.  He then uses the scoop as a cane as he tries to get down low enough to retrieve the tongs.  He doesn't make it on his first try and stands.  He then drops to his knees and his momentum takes him low enough that he grabs the tongs before the suit can force him up.
145:50:34||alsj|Fendell is panning left.
145:51:04||alsj|Charlie may be at the back of the Rover stowing the scoop and tongs.  Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit without finding Charlie.  He then reverses direction.
145:51:12|Jones|alsj|Do you have any comment about the length of these stations?  Were they long enough that you were feeling forearm fatigue or, maybe, feeling it in the legs?
145:51:12|Duke|alsj|No.  These were some of the longest stops we had.  Except up around North Ray.  That was a long one.
145:51:12|Jones|alsj|That was an hour up there.
145:51:12|Duke|alsj|Well, we were an hour up at Cinco, almost.  You know, watching this, it looks like we didn't get much done.  But the science guys were real pleased.  I think you need to plan an hour or so at each stop because, by the time you get off and get all the equipment ready and, you know, talk back and forth and describe and just sit there and think, for a few minutes, about what you're going to do, anything less than forty-five minutes or an hour is short-sighted.  You just can't get it all done.  You can't do a good job.&quot;]
145:51:12|Jones|alsj|Is the efficiency starting to go down after an hour?&quot;]
145:51:12|Duke|alsj|No.
145:51:12|Jones|alsj|Most places you could go longer?
145:51:12|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  In a way, you get better because you get used to the terrain and what you're walking on.&quot;]
145:51:12|Jones|alsj|So you'd suggest at least forty-five minutes or an hour at a stop.
145:51:12|Duke|alsj|That's right.
145:52:20||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat with the extra SCB.
145:52:57||alsj|Fendell finds John at the back of the Rover where he is stowing the magnetometer cable.  Charlie reaches into the LMP seat pan and pulls out sample 65015 for examination.
145:53:16||alsj|Charlie re-stows the sample.
145:53:19||alsj|Charlie puts his seat down and then removes his used film magazine.
145:53:32||alsj|This is a reference to Apollo 15 sample 15555, a 9.6 kg basalt known as Great Scott that Dave Scott collected at the edge of Hadley Rille.  Great Scott is the second largest rock returned by the Apollo astronauts.  Only Big Muley, the 11.6 kg breccia Charlie collected at Flag Crater is larger.  For reference, the largest Apollo 14 rock is a 9.0 kg breccia known as Big Bertha.  It was collected by Al Shepard near the rim of Cone Crater at Station C1; and the largest Apollo 17 rock is 70215, an 8.1 kilogram basalt Jack Schmitt collected near the LM.
145:53:44||alsj|Charlie raises his seat again to stow the film magazine and John goes to the CDR seat.
145:53:46||alsj|Charlie lowers his seat.
145:53:59||alsj|Charlie leans across his seat to watch what John is doing.
145:54:12||alsj|The new film magazine apparently dropped between the seats.  Charlie retrieved it, removed the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="new" target="alsj">dark slide</a>, and passed the dark slide across to John.
145:54:24|Jones|alsj|Do you have any comments on the detailed finger-work that was involved in manipulating the dark slide?
145:54:24|Duke|alsj|Practice.
145:54:24|Jones|alsj|Never having worn those <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a>, it seems almost amazing to me that you can manipulate that dark slide.
145:54:24|Duke|alsj|Big objects you could handle, like those film mags.  You could hold the magazine with fingertips at each side, and it had a little slide at the bottom.  You just dropped it in and held it forward and then there was a lock at the top.  I had to practice, but it was pretty easy to do.  We didn't have any trouble.  It took me a little bit to get that one locked - two or three tries - but no more than normal.  You get much smaller than that, though, and that was the hard part - trying to manipulate little, small objects with those gloves.  Threading a needle would be almost impossible in those gloves.  The bigger the object, with the bulky gloves, the easier it was to get a purchase on them and do what you've got to do.
145:54:24|Jones|alsj|That film magazine looked like it was maybe fist-sized or a little bit smaller.
145:54:24|Duke|alsj|It's fist-sized; yeah.
145:54:24||alsj|It wasn't until March 2006 that I realized that the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DarkSlide.html" target="new" target="alsj">dark slide</a> had a wire handle large enough to accomodate the glove fingers.
145:54:35||alsj|Charlie installs the magazine.
145:54:35||alsj|Charlie shoots two frames and, as he does so, we can see a lever/crank on the side turn.  The first of these is completely lightstruck but the second, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17584" target="new" target="alsj">17584</a>, is partly useful.]</i></blockquote>
145:55:07||alsj|Charlie appears to examine his checklist, probably looking at either <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-10.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-10</a>, the Station 5 page, or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-11.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-11</a>, the Station 6 page.  He then reaches to turn on the 16-mm camera.]</i></blockquote>
145:55:49||alsj|The LRV shakes, possibly as John does some dusting at the front of the vehicle.
145:56:37||alsj|Charlie was standing beside his seat, facing directly forward, but now turns slightly so that, when he pushes up and back, he will be moving toward the seat back.  He jumps and, possibly, pulls himself inboard with his left arm.
145:56:42||alsj|When Charlie lands, he isn't squarely in the seat but quickly gets himself settled by planting his feet, lifting his rear off the seat and sliding sideways.
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|Did you do any training in the one-sixth-g airplane for getting on the Rover.
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  We did that.
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|What was involved in an aircraft exercise?  You'd be up for several hours, right?
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  Well, it depended on how many parabolas you could take before you got sick.  I could go a couple of hours.  Some guys, you know, two or three hours the airplane'd run out of gas and they never got sick.  Nobody actually got sick, at least in the crew, 'cause you'd stop before you actually throw up.  But you'd start feeling woozy - at least I would - and then I'd just stop and then we'd go back and land.
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|How big an area did you  have in the back of the aircraft.&quot;]
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|It was a 707.  Thirty or forty feet.  We could get a Rover back there and a pallet or so.  There was just plenty of room.  You couldn't do much walking.  I mean, you couldn't take the cables out to the ends, of course; you just practiced putting the experiments down.  And getting in and out of the Rover and setting up the Rover and putting on the LCRU and getting the TV mounted and all the plugs and all of that stuff.  It was pretty good training, really.  You just had to do it in short spurts.  You couldn't build a good timeline from that, is one problem.&quot;]
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|Would you have several support people in there with you?&quot;]
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  'Cause they'd have to help you get up and get you down.  When you start to pull out (of the dive that gives one-sixth g), it's a 2 1/2-g pull-out and, you know, 360 pounds is a lot of weight and your legs couldn't support it.  So, as the airplane started out, they'd ring a big bell and, if you couldn't get down, two guys'd would slam you to the floor and you just sort spread-eagled on the floor while doing this 2 1/2 gs.  Then, when you were ready to push over the next parabola, the guys would help you get up so you'd be ready to go when you got to the right g level.
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|Boy, that sounds tiring for them.
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|No, it wasn't too bad.
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|Spread eagle face down?
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|Generally face down.  Sometimes you'd be face up; it didn't matter.  And when I say spread-eagle, your arms might be down by your side or you might be on your elbows; but you were on the floor so you didn't have to stand 2 1/2 gs in that suit.
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|You had 30 seconds of one-sixth g...?
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|30 to 40...
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|And then how long to climb up the other side of the parabola?
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|Maybe a minute or two.  They had to dive and accelerate and get up to speed, and then he had to make that turn and then he had to establish climbing up at the right kind of pitch attitude.  And then he'd push over.  It was probably twice the time, or more, doing that part.&quot;]
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|NASA aircraft?  NASA crew?
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|Used to be an Air Force aircraft, but now it belongs to NASA.  And I think they provide the crew and everything.  In fact, I know they do, now.  Back then, I think it was an Air Force crew.  They'd fly it down from Wright-Pat(terson AFB) to Houston or Kennedy.
145:56:42|Jones|alsj|Did you do those exercises frequently?  Or just a few of them?
145:56:42|Duke|alsj|I don't remember.  We didn't do that many.  In 2 1/2 years, ten times, maybe.  It was pretty good training for, you know, balance and experiments and getting in and out of the Rover and stuff like that.  Like I say, for building timelines, it wasn't very good.  So we'd build a timeline out behind the MSOB (Manned Spacecraft Operations Building), at our training site.
145:56:57||alsj|Here, Tony is giving the vertical magnetic-field components at the three sites.  The Station 5 field is oriented in an upward direction while the ALSEP and Spook fields point down.
145:56:57||alsj|Charlie gets his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new" target="alsj">seatbelt</a> off the console and lays it across his lap.  We can see the large hook that goes on the outside handhold and the lever assembly that pulls the belt tight.
145:57:21||alsj|TV off.
145:58:49||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR10-11.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR/LMP-11</a>, they are planning a 20-minute stop at Station 6 at the base of Stone Mountain.  Brian MacInall has created a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16Station5to6TraverseMap_LROC_M175179080LR_May2016.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">planimetric map</a> of the traverse to Station 6.
145:58:50||alsj|As indicated on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a>, they are planning to stop at a LM bearing of 000 (=360) degrees and a range of 2.9 km at map coordinates <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BK.6/81.7</a>.  They are currently at a bearing/range of 353/3.5 and near map coordinates BH.7/82.7.  As shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16PPfD23.jpg" title="contour map" target="new" target="alsj">figure D-23</a> in the Professional Paper, Station 6 is a map distance of 600 meters from Station 5 and the average slope is about 7/60 or about 6.7 degrees.
145:59:01||alsj|Charlie's photos taken during the traverse to Station 6 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16trv17585-605LR.pdf" target="alsj">2.8 Mb PDF</a> ) are AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17585" target="new" target="alsj">17585</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17605" target="new" target="alsj">17605</a>.  The first few of these show the outbound Rover tracks.]</i></blockquote>
146:00:26||alsj|The Apollo 15 crew attempted to send TV signals while they were driving on a steady heading toward Hadley Rille on EVA-3.  That experiment did not work.  John is probably saying that, if Houston had real-time TV of this drive, the NASA managers would be having heart-failure and would make the crew stop and walk down the mountain.
146:00:50||alsj|Because of the limited sideways visibility provide by the suit and John's need to watch the road, he probably can't see where Charlie is pointing and wants a verbal indication of direction.  As he says in a moment, he also has his gold visor down and isn't getting much light.
146:01:24||alsj|Charlie's photo AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17589" target="new" target="alsj">17589</a> may show some of these blocks.]
146:01:24||alsj|Cobbles are pieces of rock between about 64 mm and 256 mm. He is referring to pieces larger than cobbles as 'blocks'.
146:02:55||alsj|The undulating, cratered terrain is giving them a bouncy ride.
146:02:55|Jones|alsj|I have to ask.  Had you ever ridden a camel?
146:02:55|Duke|alsj|Not up to this time.  I've ridden one later, and it doesn't remind me of riding a camel.  I don't know what he's talking about.&quot;]
146:02:55||alsj|Journal Contributor David Harland suggests an alternative explanation.  Noting John's &quot;backseat driver&quot; comment at 146:01:14, David writes &quot;John's just been given hasty instructions to make a turn, and went around the 'wrong' side of the crater. For the next minute or so, there is a debate between Duke and England about precisely where they'd best go and, when John says &quot;It's like driving a camel&quot;, John is referring to a camel being 'a horse designed by a committee', and he's saying that he's having to drive with a committee of backseat drivers.&quot;
146:03:53||alsj|As indicated on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a>, they plan to drive west from Station 6 to get to Station 8.  As shown by the contour map,the bench in the contours runs roughly northeast/southwest on this part of the mountain.
146:03:53||alsj|After they make the left turn, Charlie takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17600" target="new" target="alsj">AS16-110-17600 and 601</a>. They are driving somewhat left of down-Sun.
146:06:23||alsj|Because they are near the lunar equator, Earth is not far from the zenith - the current elevation is 77 degrees - and Rover orientation is not critical in using the sighting scope on the high-gain.]
146:06:23|Jones|alsj|Was it easiest to align the scope if you stood in front of the Rover.  Did you ever try to do it from the side?&quot;]
146:06:23|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  I don't remember it being any easier from the side or from the front.  I really don't remember what I'm thinking about, here, when I said 'point the antenna north'.&quot;]
146:06:23||alsj|Most of the pictures we have of astronauts aligning the antenna show them standing at the front of the vehicle.  Charlie's comment may be related to variations in lighting conditions with Rover parking angle.]</i></blockquote>

At each stop, as soon as the TV antenna was properly oriented so that we got signal into Mission Control, Ed would do a 360  pan with the camera as we had requested. This (pan) was recorded on Polaroid film by Ray Batson and his photogrammetrists, who were part of our group.  The Polaroid pictures were put together in a mosaic with important geologic features labeled and compass orientations marked in grease pencil.  The mosaic was placed in front of me, usually within 5 minutes of arrival at the station.  This gave us a visual summary of the immediate region and enabled us, when we didn't need to watch the astronauts, to ask Ed to move the camera '5 seconds to the right' - or whatever - and zoom in on a rock or the crater wall, etc. That way, we could get better views of the surroundings and offer sampling or photographic suggestions if we felt that they were necessary.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

146:12:44||alsj|By planting the scoop in the ground, they get a length scale and a shadow and lose only the reference to local vertical and the color/gray scale.  Scoops served as gnomons at various points on all the J missions.  Later, John and Charlie will use the tripod instead of the scoop, which will give them the color-gray scale.]</i></blockquote>

146:13:59||alsj|John takes a stereopair from the north, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17512" target="new" target="alsj">17512</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17513" target="new" target="alsj">17513</a>.  Charlie gets into position to collect a sample with the scoop and partially blocks our view of John.  Once John is finished, Charlie slides the angled scoop under a rock that is visible between his legs and lifts it.  Under Charlie's PLSS we can see a sample bag John has gotten ready.]</i></blockquote>
146:14:30||alsj|Charlie may have just poured some dirt on John's glove.]</i></blockquote>
146:14:45||alsj|John backs up to take AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17514" target="new" target="alsj">17514</a>.  Charlie also backs up to get his shadow off the sample area.

146:16:17|Jones|alsj|What did you mean when you said, 'so we won't salt it'?&quot;]
146:16:17|Duke|alsj|What my point was, if we just stayed in one spot and all the samples just happened to be pieces of one rock that broke open, it wouldn't be representative of the whole area.  So, we needed to move away and get some other samples.&quot;]
146:16:17||alsj|In the Old West, unscrupulous mine owners would &quot;salt&quot; the property with gold from elsewhere to trick a potential buyer into thinking the mine was valuable.  The gold that the owner scattered around was, of course, unrepresentative of the true content of the mine and it is that connotation of the term that Charlie is using.]
146:16:17||alsj|John gets a soil sample and does an unusual left-handed pour, pivoting the scoop through vertical by rotating his hand and arm.]</i></blockquote>
146:16:35||alsj|John takes an &quot;after&quot;, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17517" target="new" target="alsj">17517</a>.  In Charlie's shadow, we can see him sealing the bag by spinning it.]</i></blockquote>
146:16:35||alsj|John starts digging a trench, probably looking for white soil and buried rocks.]</i></blockquote>
146:17:00||alsj|John stops digging and grabs the tongs.  Charlie hops around to John's left side to get at his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
146:17:15||alsj|John points off-camera to the left with the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
146:17:23||alsj|Charlie and Fendell follow.
146:17:40||alsj|Fendell finds John, who is on the far side of the crater looking at his discovery.
146:18:02||alsj|John has some trouble planting the tongs and digs a little hole for them.]</i></blockquote>

146:18:12||alsj|Charlie goes around behind John and climbs to the crater rim.

146:18:12|Duke|alsj|On the flat, it's neat.
146:18:12||alsj|Charlie adjusts his camera settings and takes a &quot;locator&quot;, AS16-108-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17629" target="new" target="alsj">17629</a>.  John is getting ready to collect a sample with the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
146:18:28||alsj|John is standing below the sampling site and slides the scoop into the crater wall.  Charlie joins him gets a sample bag ready.]</i></blockquote>
146:18:47||alsj|John pours.
146:18:57||alsj|Apparently, John only poured the white portion of the sample into the bag.  He discards the remainder and carefully slides the scoop into the white patch a second time.]</i></blockquote>
146:19:00||alsj|John pours, putting the scoop in the bag and then raising the handle through vertical by moving his right hand forward.]</i></blockquote>
146:19:24||alsj|John gets into position to take a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; from the north.  He turns up-Sun to get some light on his camera, changes the settings, and then turns back to take the picture.]</i></blockquote>
146:19:33||alsj|John takes AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17520" target="new" target="alsj">17520</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:19:41||alsj|John turns, faces north, and stands motionless for several seconds.  He may be urinating.]</i></blockquote>
146:19:56||alsj|Charlie grabs the tongs and goes off-camera to the left.  John turns and follows.]</i></blockquote>
146:20:02||alsj|John is probably talking about the meter-sized rock on the southeast wall of the crater that is shown in AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17624" target="new" target="alsj">17624</a>.  As Fendell pans left to follow John and find Charlie, he pulls back on the zoom.]
146:20:02|Fendell, from a 1996 interview|alsj|There were some real interesting little tricks you learned with the thing, once you got the crewmen up, that you never learned with the training.  And I'll tell you what that was.  When you look at the video, you'll probably notice that, the majority of the time when you were watching a crewman, if he started to move, the first thing the camera does is it opens up.  If you're smart, the first button you hit was zoom out.&quot;]
146:20:02|Jones|alsj|I've noticed you doing that.
146:20:02|Fendell|alsj|And the reason that worked so great was, when you hit zoom out, no matter which way he was going, you were able to keep him within the field-of-view and decide which way he was going.  And that just came by experience, trying it.  If you hit the zoom out, then you kept the field open; then you could figure 'he's starting to move left.'  You can do that and then, as he moves, you follow him and, then, if he stops, you can zoom down on what he's doing.  And you'll notice that's kind of the way it happens.  It's kind of an 'Open up, left, right, in, tweak'.  I remember enough of that.  That's how you handled the delay and the movement of the crew.&quot;]
146:20:02|Jones|alsj|A nice trick.
146:20:02|Fendell|alsj|It worked pretty good.  And then we tweaked using those increment commands.&quot;]
146:20:02|Fendell|alsj|There was actually two other guys who controlled the camera at some times on Apollo 16.  A fellow by the name of Al Pennington, who is a Flight Director over there now.  And a fellow by the name of Gary Scott, who's not there any more.  But on 15 and 17, I only controlled the camera.&quot;]
146:20:02||alsj|When Fendell finds Charlie at the location of sample 66075 as shown in Figure 25 in the Stone Mountain Chapter of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  The meter-sized rock is in the foreground of the TV picture.]</i></blockquote>
146:20:22||alsj|They are working on the hypothesis that angular rocks on the surface are likely to be fragments of South Ray ejecta while rounded rocks might be samples of the Descartes formation.]
146:20:22||alsj|John plants the scoop and Charlie gets into position to take the down-Sun, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17630" target="new" target="alsj">17630</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:20:30||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17521" target="new" target="alsj">17521</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17522" target="new" target="alsj">17522</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:20:41||alsj|Charlie hops sideways around the south side of the sample location to take up-Sun &quot;locator&quot; AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17631" target="new" target="alsj">17631</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:20:56||alsj|Charlie moves in with the tongs and gets the sample without trouble.  He raises it high enough that he can remove it from the tongs with his right hand and then drops it directly into the bag John is holding open.]</i></blockquote>
146:21:08||alsj|During John's next transmission, Charlie plants the tongs and then reaches down and gets the hammer out of his right shin pocket.]</i></blockquote>
146:21:29||alsj|This is sample <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16LunarSample66075.pdf"  target="new" target="alsj">66075</a>, a 347-gram breccia shown in Figures 55C and 55D in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  John hands the sample bag to Charlie and presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
146:21:55||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the left.  John follows with the scoop and tongs.  Fendell pans to follow John.]</i></blockquote>
146:21:55||alsj|Charlie has stopped next to a half-meter, flat-topped rock which is on the crater rim beyond the meter-sized rock in AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17624" target="new" target="alsj">17624</a>.

146:22:06||alsj|Charlie leans forward on the scoop, hits the rock, and breaks off a small piece.]</i></blockquote>
146:22:16||alsj|A second blow dislodges a fist-sized piece.]</i></blockquote>
146:22:19||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop and stows the hammer in his pocket.
146:22:19|Jones|alsj|Does the suit restrict your swinging motion at all?&quot;]
146:22:19|Duke|alsj|Oh, it does!  It's hard to grab the hammer, even.  Sometimes it'd twist in your hand if you didn't hit it solid.&quot;]
146:22:19|Jones|alsj|You're lifting the head up to about helmet height; but it looks mostly like it's an elbow (bend)...&quot;]
146:22:19|Duke|alsj|You couldn't get it up much above that.
146:22:19|Jones|alsj|It's almost all elbow bend, isn't it?
146:22:19|Duke|alsj|That's right.
146:22:44||alsj|John takes up-Sun photos AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17523" target="new" target="alsj">17523</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17524" target="new" target="alsj">17524</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17525" target="new" target="alsj">17525</a>.]
146:22:44||alsj|The larger piece that Charlie broke off the rock is lying on the surface at right center in <a href="images16.html#17523" target="new" target="alsj">17523</a>.  It came off the shallow trough at the top of the far side of the rock. It is sample 66095, a 1185-gram piece of impact melt, which acquired the name <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16Sample66095.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">'Rusty Rock'</a> because of brown stains found, in particular, around iron grains within the rock.  The origin of the stains - lunar or terrestrial - has not been resolved.]

146:22:44||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the rock while John backs up and takes  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17526" target="new" target="alsj">17526</a>.]
146:22:44||alsj|The sample is 66095, a 1.2 kilogram breccia, and is shown in Figures 57C and 57D in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  In the TV picture, the fresh surface on the parent rock is quite bright.]
146:22:44||alsj|Charlie leans on the scoop, goes down on his left knee and grabs the fragment without trouble.
146:23:11||alsj|Charlie stands.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom and John steps in with a sample bag.
146:23:42||alsj|John takes the fragment for examination.
146:23:48||alsj|While John examines the rock, Charlie grabs the tongs and picks up the first fragment he broke off.]</i></blockquote>
146:24:07||alsj|Charlie puts the small sample in the bag and, while John seals it, Charlie grabs the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
146:24:17||alsj|Charlie presents his SCB.
146:24:29||alsj|Evidently, Charlie's SCB has come unhooked at the bottom.  John takes a moment to re-fasten it.]</i></blockquote>
146:24:47|Duke|alsj|We had a real problem with the (individual) sample bags and the Sample Collection Bags (SCBs).  The sample bags were the small ones (that) looked little sandwich bags.  And they were always falling off.  We had a little hook for 'em that fit up on our camera; and they were just unwieldy.  You had a difficult time pulling one off and the ring holder that held them together broke or they would fall off.  And, then, the hooks for the Sample Collection Bag on the side of the PLSS was a real headache - to get it on and to get it off.  It seemed like it took you forever to get it on and then it would just fall off!  Or, you'd try to get it off, and you couldn't get it off.  And it just never seemed to be any rhyme or reason; so, I think, as you go on more extended EVAs, we've got to pay careful attention to the design and development of the latching mechanisms of the sample containers and the hooking mechanism for the backpack - or the shopping bag concept or whatever is decided.  There's got to be a lot of attention to detail put into that.  It's not just a simple matter to get those samples into the bags and the bags collected and stored somewhere.  I think the most frustrating thing of the whole EVA was that we were always looking for sample bags because they'd fall off.  Finally, on the last EVA, I ended up pushing a few of them on the end of the little finger of my <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">glove</a>.  And I tried to operate that way; you know, get em' in my hand some way, so we wouldn't lose 'em.  Because they wouldn't stay on the camera or where we'd placed 'em, because of broken latches and hooks and stuff.  Those are the little things that end up biting you and taking time and interfering with the normal procedures.&quot;]
146:24:47|Jones|alsj|Not to mention posing the risk of losing samples and wasting an enormous amount of time.&quot;]
146:24:47|Duke|alsj|Right.  In fact, later on in here, we'll find out that John's Sample Collection Bag fell off his backpack...Fortunately, when it did it bounced and wedged itself between the frame and the fender of the Rover - or it could have bounced off on the Moon and, you know, it'd have been long gone because we were making a big loop and, to find it, we would have had to retrace our steps - you know, go counter-clockwise - to get back.  If you're just going out and back along the same route, if you lose it on the way out you can find it on the way back.  But, if you lose it on the way back, you get back to the LM and you've got to turn around and go the other way.  Those little details are important when you get down to the working aspect of an EVA.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
146:24:50||alsj|Charlie has the tongs and scoop and is saying that he will stow them on the back of the Rover.
146:24:53||alsj|Charlie heads for the Rover using his skipping stride and John follows close behind using the loping, foot-to-foot stride.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom to keep them framed.
146:25:33|Jones|alsj|Do you have any general comments that you'd like to make at this point, comparing this EVA with the first one?
146:25:33|Duke|alsj|I think we're a little bit more familiar with the terrain and the one-sixth gravity.  You know, you get more and more feeling at home.  More confidence in the equipment.  So I think we're working a little bit more efficiently.&quot;]
146:25:33|Jones|alsj|You certainly seem to be very relaxed.
146:25:33|Duke|alsj|Yeah; more organized.
146:25:33|Jones|alsj|Was there a bit more - I don't know if nervousness is the right word, maybe excitement or adrenaline would be better - during the first EVA?&quot;]
146:25:33|Duke|alsj|Oh, I think it was just excitement.  I never had a moment I felt of nervousness; expect for the time when I fell over backwards at the end.  That was scary!
146:25:33|Jones|alsj|More excitement, then, that first day.
146:25:33|Duke|alsj|No.  I don't think it was more exciting.  You're just seeing different things.  It's like you have an exciting trip going to the coast of South Carolina, but you can have an exciting trip going to Idaho, too.  So it's that kind of difference in excitement, I think.&quot;]
146:25:33||alsj|Fendell gets a good close up of John reading his checklist and turning the page.]</i></blockquote>
146:25:38||alsj|TV off.
146:26:15||alsj|Charlie had the free end of his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new" target="alsj">seatbelt</a> hooked to the console or something else convenient and has knocked it off, out of reach.
146:26:28|Jones|alsj|When you were seated, could you see things in the footpan?
146:26:28|Duke|alsj|Only at your feet, you could; you couldn't see close to the seat.  You ended up sitting...When you got in, you were almost stiff.  And then you buckled the seatbelt and then you tightened it in, that sort of helped bend the suit so you could get your rear end back in against the seat.
146:26:28|Jones|alsj|Of course!
146:26:28|Duke|alsj|What I was talking about there at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1462558" target="new" target="alsj">25:58</a>, I think, is (that) I was going to leap in.  The way you got into the Rover - for me, anyway - was to hold on to the omni-antenna mast and bounce a couple of times and jump up and sort of pull yourself in; and that just brought you over to the seat and then you'd plop down on the seat.  And I was going to do a big leap, here, but I got a pocket or something hooked on the side of the Rover and I didn't go up.  Then, as I got in the Rover, I said my seatbelt fell off and, then, that's what John was...
146:26:28|Jones|alsj|So you couldn't see it and couldn't feel for it, so you had to get off to get it re-positioned?&quot;]
146:26:28|Duke|alsj|Well, I think so.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Either I'm on the Rover here and I'm going to leap off and I get hooked on something, or I'm off and I can't get in.  I think I'm in and I can't get off, as a matter of fact, because my seatbelt fell off and I had to get out to retrieve it.&quot;]
146:26:28|Jones|alsj|Yeah.  That's what it reads like.  And you just grab on to the Rover and pull yourself up.  I gather that was no problem.
146:26:28|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
146:26:28||alsj|The following dialog suggests that after Charlie dismounted and re-positioned his seatbelt, he tried to jump back on and fell.]</i></blockquote>
146:27:49||alsj|Charlie is probably not on the Rover at this moment.  If he was, he couldn't have turned far enough for John to see the fastenings on his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
146:28:25||alsj|Very few of the astronauts remembered much about the Buddy Secondary Life-Support System.  It was actually a set of hoses that would allow them to share cooling water in the event of a PLSS failure.  Most remembered it, dimly, as a way to share oxygen.  Several of them stated that the lack of a clear memory was an indication that they hadn't believed it likely that the need to use the BSLSS would arise.]
146:28:25|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we had a buddy hose, but I'm not sure whether it was just one or...Whether it was just cooling water.  I think it was just cooling water, in case your sublimator or something went out on your PLSS. It was a way to stay cool.  And I remember you had about thirty minutes at regular workload without the LCG before you got heatstroke, I guess.  So we designed this buddy system.&quot;]
146:28:25|Jones|alsj|I gather the BSLSS was stowed behind your seat.&quot;]
146:28:25|Duke|alsj|It was hooked behind one of the seats.  It had a little handle on it, like a little flexible briefcase.  And it was Velcroed closed, I believe.  What you did is: you took a piece of Velcro from the back of the seat, stuck it through the handle, wrapped it around a couple of times and just Velcroed it on.  And it sat there and bounced, actually. And, apparently, the Velcro was coming loose or something;  I don't remember how it was looking, but it began to work it's way loose.  And I believe it was behind my seat, but I'm not really sure.&quot;]
146:28:25||alsj|The BSLSS bag was stowed behind Charlie's seat, as can be seen in AS16-108-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17729" target="new" target="alsj">17729</a>.]
146:28:25|Jones|alsj|Had you done much training on the disconnects/reconnects in the field?&quot;]
146:28:25|Duke|alsj|Not a lot.  But we'd done it enough.  It was a simple procedure.  We could have done that with no problem.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

146:29:35||alsj|As indicated on the EVA-II <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a>, which Charlie has been using as his primary reference during the traverse, the planned bearing and range to the LM at Station 8 is 014/2.9, which corresponds to coordinates <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp269.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BK.9/77.7</a>.  They are currently near BL.8/81.1.  A straight-line drive between these two points would take them 0.7 km on a heading of 285.  Tony's suggestion that they drive 0.8 km on a heading of 274 indicates that Houston thinks Station 6 was near BK.6/81.7.  On average, they will be driving slightly north of west.
146:29:35|Jones|alsj|Had the geologists anticipated that you'd be on South Ray ejecta most of this southern traverse?
146:29:35|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  We knew there were a lot of rays, from the photographs.&quot;]
146:29:35||alsj|The photographs in question were taken by Stu Roosa from the Apollo 14 Command Module.  An example is AS14-69-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a14/20150114.JPG" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">9526</a>, which has South Ray on the left and North Ray on the right.
146:29:35|Jones|alsj|They (the geologists) were looking for the basement stuff in the South Ray ejecta and then looking for the volcanics up on Stone Mountain.&quot;  (See the discussion in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp.html" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo Lunar Surface Procedures</a> volume starting on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp008.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 8</a> and, in particular, the discussion on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp014.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 14</a> and in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp015.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 2.5-4</a> on the following page.]
146:29:35|Duke|alsj|Yeah; and the whole idea was that Stone Mountain was the Descartes volcanics, a very viscous (material) that mounded up, whereas the Cayley Plain was a less viscous - more fluid - surface, and that was </i>also<i> supposed to be volcanic, you see - a more fluid character.
146:29:35|Jones|alsj|So it was not only a surprise to find breccias up on Stone but it was also a surprise to find that the South Ray ejecta was breccias, too.&quot;]
146:29:35|Duke|alsj|That's right, yeah.  So I think they ended up very pleased with that; but, at the time, it was strange.  So, yeah, we were expecting to go across the ray patterns.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
146:29:36||alsj|Charlie is simply adding the 0.8 km to the current &quot;distance driven&quot; value of 6.7 that he read off at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta6.html#1460721" target="new" target="alsj">146:07:21</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:29:53||alsj|These values indicate that Houston thinks the LM is near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CA.6/80.3</a>.  The actual LM location is only about 100 meters NNE of that spot at about CB.1/80.6.
146:30:02||alsj|Charlie is on the downslope side as they drive west, as can be seen from the leftward tilt of the horizon in Charlie's traverse photos such as AS16-108-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17636" target="new" target="alsj">17636</a>.
146:30:02|Jones|alsj|Can you describe the sensation of this cross-hill drive.&quot;]
146:30:02|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  You know, you're sitting on a slope that's 10 to 15 degrees and you're driving across slope; and I was downhill!  We were going west, so that put me downhill, and it just felt like I was going out like this!  And you know, you're looking over to the side and there's no visible support there!  You know, there's no door or anything.  And, so, you feel like you're going right off the side.
146:30:02|Jones|alsj|How about the Rover?  Did it feel stable?
146:30:02|Duke|alsj|Yeah, it felt pretty stable.  I didn't feel it was going to tilt over; but at times it did slide, to the downslope (side).  And sometimes the back end would slide more than the front so we'd end up skidding a little bit.  And 15 experienced the same situation up on Hadley (Delta), when they were driving cross-slope.  Driving cross-slope, you had to be very careful.  Up or down felt real secure; but the cross-slope - especially when you start those slides, you know...Fortunately, it'd dig into the dust and it'd stop; so we never felt like it was going to turn over.  On flat surfaces, we actually ended up spinning out, a couple of times.  Going 180.&quot;]
146:30:02|Jones|alsj|I knew that Dave and Jim did a 180 coming down off of Hadley Delta (at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.trvlm1.html#1232842" target="new" target="alsj">123:28:42</a>).
146:30:44|Duke|tech|Our Rover seatbelts were great.  The adjustments that we had made in flight in the zero-g (means one-sixth-g) airplane turned out to be just exactly right.  So, I recommend that the Apollo 17 guys have one half-hour of parabolas and get that seat belt adjustment and have them mark it down.  That's what we did and we had a little mark on them and it just worked perfect.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
146:31:03||alsj|They are currently at a range of 3.0 and, if John drives on a heading 90 degrees left of the LM bearing, they will be at the planned Station 8 location once the LM bearing reaches 015.
146:32:02||alsj|During our mission review, in looking at AS16-108-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17650" target="new" target="alsj">17650</a> - which Charlie probably doesn't take until they are much closer to Station 8 - he commented on the rock at the lower left: &quot;The LCRU would have hit that.  It was too big and he probably went around it.  But some of the others were only about a foot high or so and we were able to roll over them (as they did in the approach to the Station 4 parking place).&quot;

146:33:22||alsj|Between traverse photos AS16-108-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17646" target="new" target="alsj">17646</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17647" target="new" target="alsj">17647</a>, John makes his turn to the left.  Notice the change in apparent orientation of the shadows relative to the rocks casting them.
146:33:22||alsj|In Figure 23 of the Stone Mountain chapter of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>, the ridge can be seen running east-west in an arc between Station 6 and Station 8.  As they headed west from Station 6, they went downslope into the depression east of Wreck that is indicated by the 7800 meter contour with inward pointing dashes.  The low point of that depression is estimated to be at an elevation of 7791 meters.  At some point, John and Charlie turned in a southerly direction and climbed back up on the ridge and followed it to Station 8.  For orientation, the small, unnamed crater southeast of Wreck that has its bottom at an elevation of 7766 meters is the crater at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BK.9/76.5</a>.

146:34:42||alsj|A vesicular rock is one that contains the imprints of gas bubbles trapped in the melt from which the rock solidified.  Vesicular basalts were found at the Apollo 11, 12, 15, and 17 sites and vesicular breccias were found at the Apollo 17 site.  Apollo 17 photo AS17-141-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/images17.html#21628" target="new" target="alsj">21628</a> shows large vesicules in the Station 6 boulder.
146:34:42|Jones|alsj|Did you see any rocks you were sure were vesicular?&quot;]
146:34:42|Duke|alsj|Some.  It was hard to say whether they were impact pits or really vesicles.  You really had to analyze it.  You know, vesicular rocks are usually volcanic that have a lot of gas in 'em.  At least, terrestrial ones are.  So the gas bubbles out and forms bubbles in the rocks.  I'd have to go back and re-read the Science Report, but I don't think we found very many.
146:34:42|Jones|alsj|I don't think you did, either.
146:34:42|Duke|alsj|If any.  What I think were vesicular looking was probably impact pits in the...we had a name for that.&quot;]
146:34:42|Jones|alsj|Zap pits.
146:34:42|Duke|alsj|Zap pits.  Yeah.  We were probably looking at that.&quot;]
146:34:42|Jones|alsj|You were expecting to find volcanics and I gather that you spent a fair amount of time in Hawaii and other places looking at volcanics.
146:34:42|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  We knew what volcanics was supposed to look like.
146:35:29||alsj|Charlie's pictures taken during this section could be  AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17650" target="new" target="alsj">17650</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17651" target="new" target="alsj">17651</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17652" target="new" target="alsj">17652</a>.] </i></blockquote>

146:36:27|Jones|alsj|Was there any concern on your part - or Houston's - about you having to walk back to the LM?
146:36:27|Duke|alsj|No.  It was just getting up there, needing four wheels.  You know, getting on a steep slope where one set of wheels wouldn't hack it.  Same thing, you know, in your RV (Recreational Vehicle) with four-wheel drive.  You get off the road and you get in a situation where you'd better have four-wheel drive but it's not working, you'd better not go.  That was our concern, here.

146:38:15||alsj|They are planning to sample ray material from South Ray and the presence of large blocks is an indication that they are in a good place.]</i></blockquote>
146:41:05||alsj|The 11-degree bearing to the LM and the 2.9 km range puts them near BL.9/77.8.  I estimate similar map coordinates - BL.8/77.3 - for the position plotted in Figure 23 in the Stone Mountain Chapter of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  As can be seen in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp269.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">traverse map</a>, the crew had very little in the way of local landmarks.  From the information available to me at this writing, there is more uncertainty in my mind about the Station 8 location than any of the others.
146:41:57|Duke|alsj|If I remember, the battery wires came from the front (to the instrument panel), and  I think it was a little wire tray that came from the instrument panel down the center between the two seats; and then there was a little control box behind the seats.  I think it was electrical and partly mechanical.  I think it was covered - or the wires were shielded, anyway.  I can't remember, exactly, but all we could do was look in there and see if we could see anything loose.  To my recollection, there was nothing underneath the Rover that was a wire or mechanical.&quot;]
146:41:57||alsj|Although I was unable to locate any relevant information in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lunar Roving Vehicle Operations Handbook</a>, Charlie's recollection is suggestive of the &quot;Rear Steering Motor and Gear Reducer&quot; shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-03.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 1-3</a>. And, of course, there was a similar mechanism at the front of the vehicle. Clearly, there has to have been a distribution system to get power and signals from the batteries, through the console and handcontroller to the steering motors and the wheel motors.  Although it seems unlikely that any Rover components would have been sufficiently exposed on the undercarriage to suffer direct, mechanical damage from striking a rock, John may be suggesting that a connection shook loose during one of the impacts.]</i></blockquote>

146:44:51||alsj|Charlie is urinating.
146:44:51|Duke|alsj|You knew you had to go.  And I could never get started into that urine bag - UCD (Urine Collection Device) - without stopping (and standing still)!  Once I'd stop, then I could get going.  John, I think, could...&quot;]
146:44:51||alsj|Charlie's phone rang at this point in the interview and we stopped while he took the call.]
146:44:51|Jones|alsj|You were saying that you had to stand up to urinate in the collar.  Did the system work alright otherwise?&quot;]
146:44:51|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  It did.  It worked fine.  You had to be careful when you rolled on the condom because, if it didn't get on right it could slip off.  In fact, it did to me, one time, right before we lifted off.  I had to go and it was...We'd been in the suit and everything, and I'd already used it a couple of times on the last EVA.  Climb back inside and, you know, powered up and got ready to lift-off and, a few minutes before lift-off, I had to go again.  And you couldn't tell whether the thing was on or off; you just started going and, when I did, 'Uh-oh, something's wrong here'.  You know, warm stream down the left leg and ended up with a wet LCG and a boot full of urine.  But there's just nothing you could do about it, so you just go.&quot;]
146:44:51|Jones|alsj|And there were enough absorbing materials inside the suit that the urine didn't get into the air stream in zero-g?&quot;]
146:44:51|Duke|alsj|No, it didn't (get into the air stream).  Well, I mean, you had a little odor and it was soggy; but it dried out.  If I remember, the LCG had feet - cotton socks - attached.  When you put it on, it was like the old pajamas that babies wore, you know, with the feet in 'em.  So we had these cotton socks that was inside the suit, which was a nylon liner, which is not too absorbent.  But cotton socks were.  And then, the inside of the LCG also had some nylon, and there was a cotton backing under that, so it sort of absorbed it as it was going down the leg.  And it turned out not to be a big deal.&quot;]
146:44:51|Jones|alsj|How about provisions for defecating outside.
146:44:51|Duke|alsj|Well, we had a big diaper with a very big absorbent pad; but nobody ever used it.  I don't even know if it was ever even tested.  I'm sure they tested it, but we never did.  It would have been a big mess, but it would have worked.  It would have contained everything.  It was like a girdle.  They called it the FCD (Fecal Containment Device).  It was like a ladies girdle you pulled on and it cut out in the front so that your penis could hang out so you could get on the UCD.  But this big pad was in the back; and I'm convinced it would have worked 'cause it was just a big pad. And then, over that, you put on the LCG, then you put on your UCD and I think there was maybe a jockstrap that went on, also, and it had a hole for your penis and then you rolled on your UCD and then you buttoned that or snapped it or Velcroed it to the jockstrap, I guess - I don't remember exactly.  But, anyway, then you had to hook the tube from the UCD into the suit so that, if you were trapped in the suit (because of a cabin leak, for example), you could empty this bag, 'cause it would only carry so much urine.  But it all worked.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
146:45:09||alsj|When the TV came on, the camera was pointed aft over the left rear wheel.  John swings the camera around and cleans the lens with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">large dustbrush</a>.
146:45:17||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pans left.  Charlie may be having trouble getting the SCB on the back of the Rover open.
146:45:41||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit and starts a clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
146:45:46||alsj|Fendell finds John at the left front of the Rover.  He is scanning his checklist, probably looking at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR14-15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-14 and 15</a>.  Fendell continues the pan and John goes off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>
146:46:45|Duke|alsj|If I remember, they were interested in the character of the regolith as far as cosmic-ray bombardment and other things such as that.  And so, we were to get a sample of the regolith away from that boulder - in the general vicinity - and then we were supposed to push over the boulder and sample the regolith under the boulder.  Because the assumption was, well, since the time the rock landed, it would have blocked any of the solar wind, etc. (from reaching the soil under the rock).&quot;]</i></blockquote>
146:47:19||alsj|The double core is a one-man job and, apparently, no other one-man task was specifically assigned to John.  The Apollo 17 crew had a similar situation at their <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.trvsta4.html" target="new" target="alsj">Station 3 at Ballet Crater</a>.  Because the rake is relatively unwieldy, Charlie is wondering if this is an appropriate use of John's time.  In hindsight, John's time would have been better used collecting individual rocks with the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
146:48:21||alsj|This is a reference to checklist pages <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-24.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-24</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-25.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">25</a>, which contain boulder sampling suggestions.
146:48:21||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the back of the Rover.  He has the double core assembled and goes off-camera to the left.
146:48:54||alsj|Jones - Is your '12 o'clock' relative to the Rover heading?]
146:48:54|Duke|alsj|Right.  We were referencing it from the Rover.  And the Rover's parked south, as I look at it here on the video.  Basically, we're parked one-eight-zero heading, which would have put 12 o'clock due south.
146:48:54|Jones|alsj|Rather than being a 12 o'clock relative to down-Sun.&quot;]
146:48:54|Duke|alsj|Right.
146:48:54||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.  Note that the rake is not in its normal position on the back of the Rover.
146:49:15||alsj|Evidently, John is working east (up-Sun) of both Charlie's double-core site and the Rover.  John has already take a cross-Sun stereopair of the rake site, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17527" target="new" target="alsj">17527</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17528" target="new" target="alsj">17528</a>.  Note that he has planted the tongs to provide scale and a shadow.]</i></blockquote>
146:49:17||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie, who is taking a stereopair of the double core from the north.
146:49:17||alsj|John's down-Suns of the rake site are AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17529" target="new" target="alsj">17529</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17530" target="new" target="alsj">17530</a>.  In the background, we see Charlie taking one of his stereo pictures, either AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17682" target="new" target="alsj">17682</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17683" target="new" target="alsj">17683</a>.  The Rover is at the right.]</i></blockquote>
146:49:41||alsj|Charlie gets the hammer out of his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a> and begins driving the double core, left-handed.  NASA photo  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s72_33898.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-33898</a> shows Charlie driving a double core during training at the Kennedy Space Center on 22 March 1972.]</i></blockquote>
146:49:50||alsj|On the third blow, Charlie hits a buried rock and makes no further progress.  He stops after seven blows.  He readjusts his grip and strikes the extension handle four more times but gets no penetration.
146:50:01||alsj|Charlie delivers two more blows, shifts the hammer to his right hand, and shakes his left hand to relieve some of the stiffness.
146:50:01|Duke|alsj|To get this double core, I'm using a hammer to pound it in.  I had pushed it in as far as I could; now I'm hammering it.  And I have to rest about every three or four strokes.  It was really hard to grab that hammer strong enough to keep it from flying out of your hand when you hit the top of the core handle.  And I would rest and relax the muscle in the forearm and then I'd grab it again.
146:50:01|Jones|alsj|So it wasn't fatigue in the shoulder...
146:50:01|Duke|alsj|It was the gripping; because you really had to grip it hard to keep the handle from flying out.  A couple of times - and I'm not sure it's here - I actually dropped the hammer, it flew out of my hands.&quot;]
146:50:01|Jones|alsj|Did you run into rocks occasionally?
146:50:01|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  And I think this is one of the situations here.  This thing is not going in at all and I think that about one tube down we hit some rock.  I'm not sure I pulled this out and shook it out and started over again.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
146:50:05||alsj|Charlie takes the hammer in his left hand and swings at the extension handle.  He misses and the hammer slips out of his hand, hits him on his left ankle, and skips a couple of meters to his left.
146:50:05|Duke|alsj|See.  I just dropped the hammer.
146:50:15||alsj|Charlie gets into position to bob down to get the hammer.  He drops down almost onto his right knee but can't quite reach the hammer.  He stands, gets ready, and makes a second attempt.
146:50:32|Jones|alsj|In one conversation I had with John on the phone, he said that he had spent some time in the airplane trying to do this - bouncing down to make a dynamic grab.
146:50:32|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  He probably did.  And, you see, I tried it here a couple of times - to jump up and let the momentum coming down bend the suit so that I could pick up this hammer that I'd dropped.  I tried it twice, but I still didn't get low enough to get it. It was like grabbing blind, too.  I just never...You had to drop and time it exactly right if you got down low enough.  You couldn't really see your hand.&quot;]
146:50:32||alsj|For his third attempt, Charlie steps back, then steps forward, and jumps about a half meter off the ground so that, as he comes down, he will compress the suit more and get his hand lower.  This attempt, too, fails; but, at least, he is able to get back on his feet without difficulty.  Next, Charlie goes around to the other side of the hammer and tries to bob down on both knees but doesn't come close.  He goes off-camera to the right, headed for the back of the Rover.  See the discussion following  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new" target="alsj">119:24:37</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:51:17||alsj|During the following conversation between John and Tony, Charlie returns with the tongs.  He gets the tongs around the handle near the end but is unable to lift the entire hammer because of the weight of the head.  He then gets the tongs around the handle near the head and raises the hammer without difficulty.  He then plants the tongs in the ground.
146:51:17||alsj|Some of the astronauts wore a device called a &quot;yo-yo&quot; which consisted of a spring-wound cable and a fitting that would allow the astronaut to attach the cable to a pair of tongs or some other long-handled tool.  The yo-yo housing was secured at the astronaut's waist and allowed him to have the tongs close at hand, without actually having to use his hands to carry them.
146:51:17|Jones|alsj|Did you wear a yo-yo?
146:51:17|Duke|alsj|Yeah; but I didn't use it much.
146:51:17|Jones|alsj|Any particular reason?
146:51:17|Duke|alsj|It was just a pain to jump in and out of the Rover with the tongs on and to buckle up.  We just didn't feel like we needed it so much; so we normally just left the tongs on its storage area on the tool carrier at the back of the Rover.
146:51:17|Jones|alsj|And I guess there are only a couple of instances in the video, so far, where it would have been handy to have the tongs.
146:51:17|Duke|alsj|This is one of them.  I wasted a minute or so.
146:51:17|Jones|alsj|That's not much.
146:51:41||alsj|Charlie extracts the core, shakes it, and taps it several times with the hammer to clear the soil out.
146:51:45||alsj|Charlie pivots the double core so he can look in the end to make sure it is empty.  He then moves west to a fresh surface.  During John's next transmission, Charlie pushes the core about six inches into the ground,  He then backs up and takes a stereopair from the north, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17684" target="new" target="alsj">17684</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17685" target="new" target="alsj">17685</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:52:38||alsj|These are samples 68515 to 68537 and represent a variety of rock types.]</i></blockquote>
146:52:49||alsj|Charlie strikes the extension handle left-handed seven times and then switches the hammer to his right hand and delivers seven more blows.  The first two of the right-handed blows were struck with the hammer's striking surface but, because this is such a small surface, Charlie stops for a second, rotates the hammer head ninety degrees, and delivers the rest of the blows with the flat side of the hammer.  All of the astronauts who drove cores used the flat most of the time because of its larger surface area.
146:52:49||alsj|Next, Charlie uses both hands to deliver seven more blows and then hops around to the south side of the core to continue.  Despite his efforts to this point, Charlie has only managed to drive in one of the cores.]
146:52:49||alsj|John crosses the TV field-of-view from left to right.  Once he is out of the way, we see Charlie swinging the hammer left-handed.  He misses several of the next eight attempts.  On each swing, he is raising his hand up to the level of the top of his helmet.]</i></blockquote>
146:53:26||alsj|After three more left-handed swings, Charlie stops.  He transfers the hammer to his right hand and tries to shake the fatigue out of his left hand.]</i></blockquote>
146:53:38||alsj|Charlie stands, resting, with his left arm up at chest height and his right arm down at his side with the hammer in that hand. Because of the internal cabling system and the pressure in the suit, he can leave his left arm upraised without having to use his muscles.]
146:53:38||alsj|John crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left.  He may have gotten an extra SCB to use at the rake site.]</i></blockquote>
146:53:50||alsj|Charlie strikes a dozen left-handed blows with the hammer, stopping every once in a while to adjust his grip.  He then delivers eleven right-handed blows.  Several times he delivers either a glancing blow or misses entirely.  He is making progress.]
146:53:50|Jones|alsj|Was it difficult to get distance right?
146:53:50|Duke|alsj|Yeah, it was.  You can see I keep missing it.  It was hard to swing a hammer in that suit; this wasn't the easiest task in the world.&quot;]
146:53:50|Jones|alsj|You're switching over to the right hand.  You're rotating the head, there?&quot;]
146:53:50|Duke|alsj|Yeah; it keeps doing it on its own, really.  You couldn't hold it tight enough to keep it from rotating.&quot;]
146:53:50|Jones|alsj|You want to keep the head flat, but the impact wants to rotate it.&quot;]
146:53:50|Duke|alsj|That's right.
146:54:57||alsj|Charlie stows the hammer in his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.
146:54:57|Jones|alsj|It looked like you got the hammer back in the pocket fairly easily - by touch, I guess.&quot;]
146:54:57|Duke|alsj|By feel.  Uh-huh.
146:55:03||alsj|Charlie hops around to the north side of the core and takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17686" target="new" target="alsj">17686</a>.  Charlie took this picture from virtually the same spot as <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17685" target="new" target="alsj">17685</a>.  Although Charlie obliterated the foreground rock pattern that we saw in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17685" target="new" target="alsj">17685</a> as he hammered, the background patterns are identical in the two pictures.]
146:55:03||alsj|Charlie moves in, grabs the cross piece on the top of the extension handle, and pulls the core out without effort.]
146:55:03||alsj|In post-mission cataloging of the samples, the top core section was designated 68002 and the bottom section 68001.  A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16cores68001-2.html" target="new" target="alsj">discussion</a> of analyses performed in 1993-94 has been extracted from NASA Johnson's Lunar News.
146:55:24||alsj|Charlie rotates the core until the bit end is up.  He turns and heads for the back of the Rover.
146:55:40||alsj|Charlie grabs the tongs and goes off-camera to the right.
146:55:46||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and pans left.
146:55:46||alsj|In Houston, Flight and the support staff are discussing procedures they will have John use to check out the Rover.
146:55:46||alsj|John's &quot;after&quot; of the rake site is AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17531" target="new" target="alsj">17531</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:56:23||alsj|Fendell stops when he has the two-meter boulder in view.  The white boulder is in the background to the right.  Fendell then zooms in on the large boulder.
146:56:23||alsj|John has found a piece of black glass.  His photos of the sample are a down-Sun, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17532" target="new" target="alsj">17532</a>; a cross-Sun stereopair, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17533" target="new" target="alsj">17533</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17534" target="new" target="alsj">17534</a>.]
146:56:23||alsj|In the next picture, frame  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17535" target="new" target="alsj">17535</a>, the piece of black glass is about 1/4 of the way up the right edge of the image between the two sets of footprints.  The rake swaths are at the upper center.]</i></blockquote>
146:56:54||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and pans left.  He finds John, who is south of the rake site taking a cross-Sun picture, probably AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17535" target="new" target="alsj">17535</a>.] </i></blockquote>
146:57:34||alsj|John has at least one bag left and takes it off his camera.
146:58:01||alsj|John plants the tongs near the extra SCB and then goes back to get another sample.  He drops easily to his right knee and stays down long enough to pick up a second sample.  He then rises, bags the sample, rolls the top, and seals it.
146:58:01|Jones|alsj|He was able to get right down on his knee!
146:58:01|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  He was able to split farther than I was...
146:58:01||alsj|We watched John pick up the rock again.
146:58:01|Duke|alsj|John's going down to pick up a rock with his hand and he had an ability to jump up and then do a fairly good split and get down and hold himself down and pick up a rock.  And then his knee would start to move up and it would bounce him up.
146:58:01|Jones|alsj|He was actually down on right knee and sort of had his left leg sort of out behind him.
146:58:01|Duke|alsj|The left was behind, a little bit, but almost even, really.&quot;]
146:58:01|Jones|alsj|That's interesting.  Let me see if I can get a print of that off the video to put in the Journal.  He had really good balance control.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
146:58:46|Duke|alsj|They didn't want him to do that.  He just apologized.
146:58:46|Jones|alsj|Any particular reason?
146:58:46|Duke|alsj|Well, I think they were worried about the wear and tear on the suit; you know, putting a lot of extra stress on the suit which, you know, was never designed to do that kind of stuff.
146:58:46||alsj|John walks to the extra SCB, puts bag 413 in, and picks the SCB up off the ground.
146:59:04||alsj|John goes off-camera to the left, taking the SCB but leaving the rake and the tongs at the front of the Rover.
146:59:04||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds John putting the extra SCB under the CDR seat.
146:59:45||alsj|John goes off-camera to the right.  Fendell follows.  At some point, John takes a pair of &quot;after&quot; photos of the rake site, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17536" target="new" target="alsj">17536</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17537" target="new" target="alsj">17537</a>, which show Charlie at the back of the Rover with the double core.] </i></blockquote>
146:59:59||alsj|John returns with the rake and tongs and goes off-camera to the left.
147:00:05||alsj|In Houston, Fendell responds to a question from Flight: &quot;I copy.  That's fine.&quot;
147:00:22||alsj|Fendell pans right and assures Flight that they will get the signal back once John parks.  He expects the comm signal to be poor while John is driving and expects that John will have to re-aim the high gain antenna.
147:00:48||alsj|Fendell stops panning when he is aimed at the two-meter boulder.
147:01:20||alsj|As can be seen in the planimetric map (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16Station8PlanimetricMapVer2.0LROC_M175179080LR.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.7 Mb</a>, John is currently parked just north of a shallow, 10-meter crater and is about to drive around to the east rim of the same crater.
147:02:58||alsj|John may have had some trouble with his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new" target="alsj">seatbelt</a>.]</i></blockquote>
147:03:02||alsj|The TV picture shakes, probably as John jumps into his seat.  In Houston, the support staff has been trying to convince Flight to have John follow the troubleshooting procedures they have been outlining, but Flight decides to let John proceed without interruption.  They argue that the procedures are needed to isolate the failure but Flight points out that Charlie will be watching as John drives.  As they go through the following tests, it will probably help to refer to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 1-22</a> in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a> and the accompanying MSFC <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photo</a>.] </i></blockquote>

147:05:04||alsj|John got a little tongue-tied.  He was asking if Houston wanted PWM 2 on the Left Front and Right Front.]</i></blockquote>
147:05:21||alsj|John is referring to the PWM Select switch which is at the right side of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">console</a> just above the Drive Enable switches.] </i></blockquote>
147:05:39|Jones|alsj|All of the switches were on the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">console</a>.  Did they all have guards on them?&quot;]
147:05:39|Duke|alsj|They had little baskets around 'em and some of them had guards over 'em.  I don't remember which ones.&quot;]

147:05:39|Duke|alsj|You know, it was easy to bump things as you were driving, as I was reaching for maps.  It could have happened in a thousand different ways as you got on; and we never went through...We never really went through the switch positions every time we started out.  And a lot of times, you remember, I'd reach over to do something - to change batteries or something - and you can accidentally hit another switch.  And that's probably what happened here.&quot;]

With the PWM Select Switch in 1, the Rear Drive was lost.]</i></blockquote>
147:05:40||alsj|Fendell pans left.
147:05:59||alsj|Fendell zooms in on some angular blocks east of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
147:06:14||alsj|As can be seen in the TV picture, the Rover moves backwards a short distance and stops.  There is no interruption in the TV.  During Johns next transmission, Fendell pulls back on the zoom.  Charlie comes into view, bounding away from the Rover using his skipping stride.]</i></blockquote>
147:06:20||alsj|TV signal ends.
147:08:01||alsj|When the TV signal is restored, we see John at the left side of the picture.  The TV camera has not moved and we are still looking in a south-easterly direction.  Fendell starts panning left but John goes off-camera to the right to join Charlie at the boulder.  Fendell stops the leftward pan and follows John.]</i></blockquote>
147:08:51||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie, who are standing on the northeast side of the boulder with their backs to us.  The boulder is about 1.1 meters high and 1.5 meters wide.  In the background to the right, we can see the white rock.]
147:08:51||alsj|Charlie has probably already taken a series of photos from the northeast, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17687" target="new" target="alsj">17687</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17692" target="new" target="alsj">17692</a>.  The boulder is large enough that he took a stereo sequence containing three frames, stepping to his left between frames.  This is called a &quot;flightline stereo&quot;.  He then moved in closer to take another set.  In <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17692" target="new" target="alsj">17692</a>, we can see a number of large inclusions in this breccia.]</i></blockquote>
147:09:07||alsj|Charlie leans on the rock, gets his left shoulder down and tries to push it over.  It doesn't appear to move.
147:09:17||alsj|John has gone around the south side of the rock and Charlie the north.  John thinks they will be able to tip it over by pushing from the west if they put a significant effort - rather than &quot;no effort&quot; - into it.
147:09:30||alsj|Charlie puts his right hand on the top of the rock and gives it a push, but not very hard.
147:09:38||alsj|Charlie bounds off-camera to the left while John takes an up-Sun stereopair, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17538" target="new" target="alsj">17538</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17539" target="new" target="alsj">17539</a>.  John then raised his aim to take a picture of the top of the boulder, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17540" target="new" target="alsj">17540</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:10:19||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the boulder and John goes off-camera to the left to join Charlie at the Rover.
147:10:19||alsj|Fillets are composed of ejecta from nearby - or distant - impacts that splash on the side of the rock and fall down onto the rising skirt of dirt. On average, the longer a rock has been in place, the bigger the fillet surrounding it.  As described in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>, cosmic-ray-exposure ages of the rocks at Stations 8 and 9 indicate that the South Ray impact, which ejected these blocks, as about 2 million years ago, a time too short for much fillet development.]</i></blockquote>
147:10:39||alsj|John gets the scoop from Charlie and takes up a position north of the boulder.  Charlie stands northeast of the boulder, carrying the tongs, and adjusts his camera for some close-ups.]</i></blockquote>
147:10:39||alsj|During Tony's next transmission, Charlie rests the tip of the tongs on the rock near the top and, using the tongs to gauge his distance, takes a close-up stereopair, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17693" target="new" target="alsj">17693</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17694" target="new" target="alsj">17694</a>, stepping to his right between frames but not moving the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
147:10:39||alsj|Charlie re-positions the tongs and takes AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17695" target="new" target="alsj">17695</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17696" target="new" target="alsj">17696</a>, stepping to his left between frames.]</i></blockquote>
147:11:11||alsj|While Charlie was taking pictures, John stuck his right leg out behind him and bent down far enough that he could reach the hammer in Charlie's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.  He tried to pull it out, but it was caught because John is trying to get it out from the side.]</i></blockquote>
147:11:23||alsj|Charlie pulls the hammer straight up and gets it out without difficulty.]</i></blockquote>
147:11:35||alsj|Charlie is trying to rest the tongs on the top of the rock but is having some trouble to get it in stable position.]
147:11:35||alsj|This boulder is perched on the northeast rim of the shallow secondary crater it made when it hit.  Part of the crater can be seen just beyond and to the left of the base of the boulder in AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17689" target="new" target="alsj">17689</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:12:00||alsj|Charlie gets the scoop from John.
147:12:13||alsj|John gets a sample bag off his camera and then backs up to take a cross-Sun &quot;before&quot; from the north.  Charlie moves around to the northeast side and tries to hold the scoop over the place where he will sample.
147:12:17||alsj|Charlie is having a difficult time keeping his shadow off the soil at the base of the rock.  John takes a single picture at about this time, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17541" target="new" target="alsj">17541</a>, which shows the scoop resting on the fillet at the base of the rock.  This is one of the best Apollo fillet photos.]</i></blockquote>
147:12:32||alsj|John is telling Charlie not to bother with the scoop in the &quot;before&quot; pictures.]</i></blockquote>
147:12:39||alsj|Charlie backs away and John takes a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17542" target="new" target="alsj">17542</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17543" target="new" target="alsj">17543</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:12:48||alsj|Charlie moves in to get the fillet sample but covers the area with his own shadow.]</i></blockquote>
147:12:51||alsj|Both John's and Charlie's comm seem to be clipping more than usual since John moved the Rover.]
147:12:51||alsj|Charlie raises a scoopful of soil and pours it into the waiting bag.]</i></blockquote>
147:13:06||alsj|Charlie rests the scoop against the east face of the boulder and grabs a small fragment off the top.  John takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17544" target="new" target="alsj">17544</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:13:33||alsj|John hands bag 374 to Charlie, who then puts the fragment in.]</i></blockquote>
147:13:52||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17545" target="new" target="alsj">17545</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17546" target="new" target="alsj">17546</a>, while Charlie spins the bag and then seals it.  He never does take another photo of this boulder.]</i></blockquote>
147:14:06||alsj|John tries to pry off a fist-sized piece about halfway up the north face.]</i></blockquote>
147:14:15||alsj|During geology training, they have learned that the best place to hit a rock is in a location where natural fractures have created a piece of rock which, with only a little encouragement from a hammer, will come loose easily.  Not surprisingly, of all the Apollo moonwalkers, geologist Jack Schmitt was most adept with the hammer.  Of the pilots who wielded hammers, John and Charlie were among the best.  John hits the protruding piece five times.]</i></blockquote>
147:14:20||alsj|The fifth blow dislodges the fragment, which falls to the ground.
147:14:23||alsj|John bobs down and grabs the sample.  Charlie appears to get into position to take a down-Sun but, perhaps because his shadow covers the sample location, doesn't take a picture.
147:14:41||alsj|Charlie gets a bag off his camera.  Note that he is still holding the bag with the fillet sample.]</i></blockquote>
147:14:47||alsj|Charlie puts the fillet sample in John's SCB while John continues to examine the boulder fragment.]</i></blockquote>
147:14:53||alsj|John gives the boulder fragment to Charlie, who examines it.]</i></blockquote>
147:14:59||alsj|This sample is 68115, a 1.2 kilogram breccia which is shown in Figure 85F in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  The sample is 15 x 9.5 x 8.5 cm and John is skeptical that Charlie will be able to get it bagged.  When flat, the bags are 19 x 20 cm.  With the top spread open, the circular orifice is 12 cm across.]</i></blockquote>
147:15:14||alsj|John presents his SCB.
147:15:37||alsj|Charlie skips toward the white rock while John takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17547" target="new" target="alsj">17547</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:15:47||alsj|What John means is that the people doing the post-mission analysis won't have any trouble figuring out how the fragment originally fit into the boulder.
147:15:47||alsj|John uses the loping stride as he runs to join Charlie.  The white rock is about knee-height and Charlie is bent at the waist as he leans forward on the tongs to examine it.]</i></blockquote>
147:16:24||alsj|Because crystalline rocks are formed under pressure at depth, they are unlikely to contain vesicles, which are imprints of gas bubbles.]</i></blockquote>
147:16:25||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop next to the rock to serve as a gnomon and then moves away to the northeast and plants the tongs.  John gets in position to take a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17548" target="new" target="alsj">17548</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17549" target="new" target="alsj">17549</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:16:46||alsj|As John approaches the rock, Charlie hops a meter or so to his left and takes a down-Sun, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17697" target="new" target="alsj">17697</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:17:08||alsj|John goes around to the southwest side of the rock and down into a depression so that the top of the rock is at about waist height.
147:17:08|Jones|alsj|I get the sense, at least at this station, that John's deferring to you in the geology decisions.  How did that come about?  Were you conscious of that?  Was it that he was concentrating on spacecraft systems and you on the geology. Or was it a matter of personality? Or what?&quot;]
147:17:08|Duke|alsj|I think it's more just personality, here.  We were working together and we just talked back and forth about decisions.  I probably was a little more familiar with the geology routine than he was.  Yeah, I concentrated more on that than he did. So, while it sounds like maybe I'm making the decisions, its really not.  We were really working together.  And I had just the sense that we were just talking it out, back and forth.
147:17:08|Jones|alsj|It would be a reasonable split of responsibilities or, at least, areas of emphasis.
147:17:08||alsj|John taps the rock lightly three times.
147:17:14||alsj|Apparently, John has almost dislodged a fragment.  His &quot;Aw, shoot&quot; seems to be the equivalent of &quot;This is too easy&quot;.  He taps the rock one more time and picks up the fragment, which is now loose, and examines it.
147:17:14||alsj|The crystalline rocks that make up much of the ancient lunar crust are composed primarily of the mineral plagioclase - known by it's nickname, &quot;plage&quot;, which rhymes with &quot;badge&quot;.
147:17:14|Jones|alsj|The statements in this section suggest that you're both </i>very<i> up on the geology.
147:17:14|Duke|alsj|Yeah, well, we had a lot of training.  The equivalent of a master's degree.  You know, we were able to recognize igneous and volcanic rocks.  Although most of our training had been in volcanics, we'd had enough training with the igneous to be able to recognize them.  But everything was so fine-grained, though, it was really difficult.  We never saw any big grain stuff like the granodiorites out in the Rocky Mountains.  But there was no question about it;  you were looking at a single, one-matrix rock, with no breccias in this case, right here.  And I think it was white because it had been shocked.  But we'd studied and studied and studied.&quot;]
147:17:14||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s71-51605.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S71-51605</a> shows John and Charlie training at Taos, New Mexico in 1971.  Journal Contributor Markus Mehring calls attention to the chest-mounted Hasselblads, which are identical to the flight cameras and which were used by the astronauts to practice taking pictures so that they could hone their ability to accurately set the focal distance and f-stop, and to properly aim the camera.  Pictures taken during these field exercises were developed and then studied by the crew to improve their technique.  The image was scanned by Ken Glover from Gene Simmon's  </i>On the Moon with Apollo 16 - A Guidebook to the Descartes Region<i>.
147:17:14|Jones|alsj|And there's certainly no doubt that, while John sometimes gives an impression of a good ol', slow-talking, slow-thinking country boy, in fact....
147:17:14|Duke|alsj|Well, in our book (</i>Moonwalker<i> by Charlie and Dotty Duke), I describe that.  John sometimes talks like he's the good ol' country boy and just ignorant.  But he's not.  That's just the way his personality is.  He's extremely sharp and he has a tremendous engineering mind.  He was up on this; he knew what he was looking at.  It sounds like Elmer Fudd; but he wasn't.  He was really sharp.
147:17:14|Jones|alsj|There are statements like this that make it very obvious.&quot;]
147:17:14||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-fudd.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Elmer Fudd</a> is the slow-witted Looney Toons cartoon character who is forever tormented by that &quot;wascally wabbit&quot;,  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-bugs.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Bugs Bunny</a>.]</i></blockquote>
147:17:35||alsj|John hands the fragment to Charlie.  This sample may be 68416, a 178-gram piece of feldspar-rich crystalline rock with a &quot;sugary texture&quot;, which is shown in Figure 86F in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  There are inconsistencies in the figure labeling in the Professional Paper with regard to this fragment and two others John and Charlie will collect off this rock.]</i></blockquote>
147:18:03||alsj|John steps to the north, but not out of the depression.]</i></blockquote>
147:18:18||alsj|John steps in and taps the rock lightly - barely moving his hand - and breaks two or three pieces off a corner.
147:18:25||alsj|John transfers the hammer to his left hand and reaches forward with his right and picks up a fragment that didn't fall off the boulder.
147:18:37||alsj|After they get the fragment bagged, Charlie steps back and takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17698" target="new" target="alsj">17698</a>.  John takes AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17550" target="new" target="alsj">17550</a> from a few feet to Charlie's right.]</i></blockquote>
147:18:57||alsj|Charlie grabs the tongs.
147:19:02||alsj|Charlie cleans the tongs and picks up a third fragment.]</i></blockquote>
147:19:08||alsj|Once John has the fragment, Charlie plants the tongs and seals bag 341.  The two fragments they already have were picked up off the boulder and, consequently, are clean.  The third fragment fell to the surface, got dirty, and Charlie doesn't want to get soil in bag 341.
147:19:08||alsj|Sample 68415 arrived in the Lunar Receiving Lab as two pieces with total weight of 371 grams.  There is an extensive discussion beginning on page 1042 in Part 3 of the Catalog of Apollo 16 Rocks ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16SampleCat_3.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">41Mb PDF</a>.  Page 1055 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16SampCatp1055.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">634k</a> ) is a diagram showing the two pieces and the subsequent divisions done for various types of analysis.  The larger of the two received fragments - designated 68415,2 - is shown in lab photo S72-41545 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-41545.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">814k</a>.
147:19:31||alsj|Charlie puts bag 341 in John's SCB.
147:19:31||alsj|John is saying that they ought to push the rock from the northeast and try to tip it into the depression he was standing in.
147:19:59||alsj|While Charlie bags and seals the third fragment, John steps forward toward the scoop and presents his SCB.
147:20:13||alsj|John kneels on the east side of the white boulder and tries to push it with his right hand.  It doesn't move and he stands.]</i></blockquote>
147:20:27||alsj|John grabs the scoop and plants it out of the way, about a meter north.  The tongs are already north of the rock.]</i></blockquote>
147:20:37||alsj|John and Charlie are both in the depression and appear to put their hands low on the rock and try to push it over.]</i></blockquote>
147:20:49||alsj|The boulder is about 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.75 meters and, consequently, has a volume of about 0.19 cubic meters.  The rock density is about 2000 kilograms per cubic meters and the terrestrial weight of the rock is about 380 kg or 840 pounds.  The lunar weight is about 60 kg or 140 pounds.  Although these are very rough estimates, they suggest that, with good traction and a favorable boulder position on the surface, John and Charlie might have been able to overturn the boulder.  Certainly, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.sta2.html" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 15 Station 2</a>, Dave Scott was able to overturn a boulder of similar size. Here, the boulder may be wedged into the side of the depression.]</i></blockquote>
147:21:13||alsj|Charlie grabs the tongs and scoop and heads off-camera to the left.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom.  John continues to examine the southwest face of the white boulder and then appears to give one last try at turning it over.]</i></blockquote>
147:21:29||alsj|John gives up and follows Charlie.
147:21:39|Jones|alsj|John's coming back from the rock.  Is he playing?&quot;]
147:21:39|Duke|alsj|I think he's just playing.  Or he's trying to jump out of a crater.  He really got up in the air then.&quot;]
147:21:39|Jones|alsj|One leg back, one leg forward.
147:21:39||alsj|John goes off-camera to the left and Fendell pans to the right.]</i></blockquote>
147:22:17||alsj|Charlie takes a cross-Sun stereopair from the north, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17699" target="new" target="alsj">17699</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17700" target="new" target="alsj">17700</a>.  Note that John has the hammer in his right <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.  John takes a stereopair from the southwest, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17551" target="new" target="alsj">17551</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17552" target="new" target="alsj">17552</a>.]
147:22:17||alsj|This rock is about 1.5 meters across and probably weighs twenty or thirty times as much as the white boulder.
147:22:43||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.
147:22:45||alsj|The idea is to compare the composition and exposure age of samples of soil taken from the top of the boulder, from the fillet, and from an area away from the rock with chips taken from the rock.  If fillets are derived mostly from regolith that splashes against the rock, the three soil samples will show similar compositions.  One the other hand, if the fillet material is primarily eroded from the rock itself, the top and fillet samples will be similar in composition to the rock and will be different from the soil taken at a distance from the rock.
147:22:58||alsj|Useful comparisons can still be made if the top of the rock is dust free.
147:23:30||alsj|Tuff is a rock made of volcanic ash fused by its own internal heat.  John and Charlie saw a great deal of tuff on their geology <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ap-geotrips.html" target="new" target="alsj">field trips</a> in the western U.S., especially in New Mexico and Arizona.
147:24:01|Jones|alsj|The way I interpret this is that the fillet was mostly on one side, that ejecta from some other impact had splashed against.
147:24:01|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  But, you know, it means it hit and skidded in.&quot;]
147:24:01|Jones|alsj|Ah!  Rather than something being thrown against it?&quot;]
147:24:01|Duke|alsj|Yeah. Or, it could have been the other.  You're right.  It could have been one or the other.  The rock hit and skidded in to a stop and dug in; or, as it was sitting there, an explosion blasting out stuff from another rock (impact) could have come in and hit it.  But it didn't have anything on the top, so that's...That (meaning ejecta from another impact) would have probably left dust up on the top of the rock, too.  And this rock didn't have it.  So it was more likely that, as it hit, it dug in.
147:24:01||alsj|As shown in Figure 14 in the South Ray chapter of the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>, the fillet is on the north side of the boulder and, as author V. Stephen Reed writes, it &quot;appears to be old regolith pushed up when the boulder landed, rather than a fillet formed by rock degradation (which is a third means of producing fillets).&quot;]</i></blockquote>
147:24:33||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie working ENE of the Rover.  They are just visible past the high-gain mast.  As can be seen in Figure 6 in the South Ray chapter of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>, they are about 33 meters from the second Rover parking place.
147:24:33||alsj|During Charlie's next transmission, he backs away from the rock, grabs the shovel, plants it near the rock and then backs up again and takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; of the fillet sample from the north, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17701" target="new" target="alsj">17701</a>.  As can be seen in the picture, John is trying to knock a chip off the top of the rock, using strokes of no more than a few inches.]</i></blockquote>
147:25:04||alsj|This rock is particularly hard and John is probably worried that a chip will fly off and hit Charlie.  A chip hitting the suit at any plausible velocity would not cause any significant damage, but it could scratch the visor or, if it hit in just the wrong place, be felt.]</i></blockquote>
147:25:06||alsj|While Charlie watches, John comes around the east side of the boulder.  Evidently, John has been unable to get a chip.]</i></blockquote>
147:25:10||alsj|John pulls the hammer back a few inches and taps off a chip.
147:25:16||alsj|John hits the rock twice more with short strokes and knocks off an even bigger piece.
147:25:19||alsj|Charlie hops sideways to get the tongs and a sample bag pops out of his SCB and falls to the ground.
147:25:24||alsj|Charlie heads for the boulder with the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
147:25:33||alsj|Having turned to look for the fallen bag, Charlie returns and retrieves it with the tongs.
147:25:49||alsj|Charlie hands the bag to John and presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
147:26:15||alsj|Charlie is hidden by the high-gain mast while he picks up the boulder fragment.  The sample is 68815, a 1.8 kg breccia, which is shown in Figure 88D in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  It is 21 x 15 x 5 cm in size and, as Charlie mentions in a moment, is too big to fit in a sample bag.  It is also too big for the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
147:26:44||alsj|Although John is mostly hidden by the high-gain mast, he goes to his knees to get the sample.  Charlie stands next to him and helps him rise.]</i></blockquote>
147:27:11||alsj|John hands the sample to Charlie and presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
147:27:22||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;afters&quot;, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17553" target="new" target="alsj">17553</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17554" target="new" target="alsj">17554</a>.

147:27:50||alsj|Charlie bends his knees, probably as he gets the small sample.]</i></blockquote>
147:28:09||alsj|According to Bailey and Ulrich, this is sample 68810, which I do not find listed in either the Professional Paper or the Preliminary Science Report.
147:28:09||alsj|While Charlie bags the sample, John goes around to the north side of the boulder and moves the scoop out of the way.
147:28:23||alsj|John puts his right shoulder into the rock and pushes on the east face while Charlie pushes in the same direction from John's right.
147:28:23||alsj|In tandem, they push on the rock five times and manage to rock it a few degrees each time.  However, it doesn't appear that the base of the rock at their feet rises more than a centimeter or two.]
147:28:23|Jones|alsj|John was down fairly low, pushing with his hands.
147:28:23|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  And it was like putting your shoulder into it; you make your arm 90 degrees and pull your hand up next to your shoulder and that way you can push on it.  And you can lock your elbow into your side.  And then you could get over and then you could start moving.  And we rocked it a couple of times, but it was just too big.  It doesn't look like we got it over on this one.
147:28:23|Jones|alsj|Do you remember any damage to the outer surface of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a>?
147:28:23|Duke|alsj|No.
147:28:23|Jones|alsj|Any abrasion or tearing or anything like that.?
147:28:23|Duke|alsj|Nothing that sticks in my mind.  There were some rough...There was a little roughness...We had not only the EVA gloves, but we had these little - like a golf glove - that went over those, with the tips of the fingers cut out.  And that was a pretty good pad.&quot;]
147:28:23|Jones|alsj|And you were still wearing those?
147:28:23|Duke|alsj|We were wearing those.
147:28:40||alsj|They stand.
147:28:45||alsj|Behind the high-gain mast, John presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
147:29:01||alsj|John is completely hidden by the high-gain mast, but is probably making one last try to tip the boulder.
147:29:01||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom.
147:29:52||alsj|John goes to his knees to get the scoop which, apparently, had fallen.
147:30:25||alsj|John plants the scoop and backs up to take a cross-Sun stereopair from the south, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17555" target="new" target="alsj">17555</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17556" target="new" target="alsj">17556</a>.  Charlie's down-Sun is AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17702" target="new" target="alsj">17702</a>.  The Rover is in the background and John is at the right, holding the hammer.] </i></blockquote>
147:30:51||alsj|Charlie walks toward the scoop - walking slowly to avoid kicking dust - and plants the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
147:31:10||alsj|While John looks around, Charlie gets a sample bag ready.]</i></blockquote>
147:31:18||alsj|John grabs the scoop and gets a scoopful of soil.  In Houston, Tony asks the Backroom if they &quot;want to mess around with a foot-and-a-half boulder&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
147:31:36||alsj|While Charlie spins the bag closed, John takes an &quot;after&quot; from the south, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17557" target="new" target="alsj">17557</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:31:56||alsj|Charlie gives John the sample bag and presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
147:32:12||alsj|John turns to look south.
147:32:26||alsj|Charlie has dropped the hammer.  He tries to bob down to get it but loses his balance and lands heavily on his hands and knees.
147:32:45||alsj|Charlie wants John to push back on his head so he can rotate his torso up and over his knees.  Instead, John goes to Charlie's left side and holds out his hand.]</i></blockquote>
147:32:50||alsj|Charlie takes John's hand and rises, albeit awkwardly.  As he rises, a sample bag comes out of his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
147:32:52||alsj|A second bag comes out of Charlie's SCB.
147:33:11||alsj|Charlie gets one of the fallen bags and gives it to John, who puts it in Charlie's SCB.]</i></blockquote>
147:33:18||alsj|Charlie has retrieved the second bag and John is stowing it.]</i></blockquote>
147:33:44||alsj|John and Charlie head for the Rover and, because they are going radially, Fendell is able to follow them by pulling back on the zoom and panning slowly left.  Charlie is on the right, with the tongs in his right hand.  John is on the left with the hammer in his right hand and the scoop in his left.  Charlie slows his skipping stride to avoid losing more bags and covers roughly 32 meters in 37 seconds, which is an average speed of only 3.1 km/hr.  John started 3 seconds later, possibly so he could watch Charlie's SCB, but arrives at about the same time.  His average speed is about 3.4 km/hr.  They go off-camera to the left.]
147:33:44||alsj|In Houston, Flight is told that the crew could be given a 20-minute extension of the EVA.  In addition, Jim Lovell, who is the Backroom spokesman, tells Flight that they would like Charlie to take some 500-mm photos of Stone Mountain.  These will give the photo analysts a view from a different angle than the series taken near the LM and during EVA-1.  Flight decides that, after they get the SCBs changed and the photos taken, they should press on to Station 9.]</i></blockquote>
147:34:51||alsj|John appears at the left side of the TV picture and, although our view is partially blocked, it is evident that he stows the hammer in his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.]</i></blockquote>
147:35:22||alsj|While he works on Charlie's SCB, we only see the back of John's PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
147:35:36||alsj|Now that John has Charlie's SCB off, Charlie bounds around to John's left side and, on-camera, starts to remove his SCB.  After a moment, however,  Charlie drifts off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>
147:36:01||alsj|There are some core tubes in John's SCB and the thought may have been that, by taking the core tubes out, they could pack the samples in more tightly before securing the cover.
147:38:01||alsj|They may be stowing the bags on the inside of the gate at the back of the Rover.  The gate is undoubtedly Charlie's &quot;door&quot;.  See a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16det18825.jpg" title="image detail" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18825" target="new" target="alsj">18825</a>.]
147:38:01||alsj|Fendell pans clockwise.
147:38:01||alsj|In Houston, Flight is having a discussion with the Rover operations people about switch configurations for the traverse to Station 9.  They are not convinced that they understand the problem John had during the traverse from Station 6 and want him to draw both front and back power from PWM 1.  After that, there is a discussion about battery configurations.
147:38:07|Duke|alsj|The camera was sticking out there, you know, six inches or so and it just made it difficult to get close to things to work.  So, by taking the camera off, you were able to work a lot easier.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
147:38:56||alsj|Charlie is attaching John's SCB but I am unable to make sense of John's &quot;pull it in the breeze&quot;, if that is a correct transcription.  It suggests getting somthing to open fully by holding it up to the wind.  If so, John is joking, perhaps in reference to Charlie's various attempts to blow dust off of things.]</i></blockquote>
147:39:40||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie at the back of the Rover.  Charlie is attaching John's new SCB.
147:39:40||alsj|In Houston, Flight asks Tony if he has copied the Rover switch changes.  Tony has probably been trying to listen to  both the conversation in the MOCR and the conversation on the Moon but seems to have copied all the switch changes.
147:40:02||alsj|Charlie goes to the LMP seat, picks up his Hasselblad and mounts it on his RCU bracket.]</i></blockquote>
147:40:14||alsj|John opens the gate at the back of the Rover.  It is hinged at the left rear, behind the CDR seat.  Charlie joins him and then turns his checklist page, probably to look at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-16.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-16</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-17.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-17</a>.]</i></blockquote>
147:40:32||alsj|Charlie turns to his left so John can attach the new SCB to the right side of his PLSS.  The new SCB is creased from having been folded on the Hand Tool Carrier for several months.]</i></blockquote>
147:41:00||alsj|With Charlie bent over, John stands behind him, bends his knees, and works on the bottom fasteners.]</i></blockquote>
147:42:14||alsj|John is referring to the Mother Goose nursery rhyme &quot;The Three Little Kittens&quot;, which first appeared in print in 1843.
147:42:34||alsj|John has been working near the right rear fender.  Once he finishes with Charlie's SCB, he stands, turns to his right, and starts to move to the other side of the Rover.  As he does so, his right leg catches on the rear fender extension.  After a moment, the fender extension breaks loose and the rest of the fender snaps back toward its normal position.
147:42:41||alsj|Charlie turns to look at the fender and then hops to his left to the gate.  Fendell follows.
147:42:41|Jones|alsj|Looking at it again, John gets down low to finish up your bag, and it looks like he just catches it with his leg, or maybe the hammer if he's got it in his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.  There's a spray of dust that comes off of it when it snaps back.
147:42:41|Duke|alsj|He caught it with his right leg.  And it popped back.  The fender was made in two parts.  There was a part that slid...The part that was fixed, that was attached to the frame in a couple of spots, that made it very wiggly.  The mounting was not real stiff, so it could rattle.  And there was another part (the extension) that slid down over the wheel, like a mud flap...&quot;]
147:42:41|Jones|alsj|On the back of this one.
147:42:41|Duke|alsj|On the back on the right-rear wheel.  And what happened, as he went by, his right leg apparently caught it, caught that bottom part, that bent the whole thing and, when the bottom, mud-flap part broke loose, the other snapped back and that threw off the dust.&quot;]
147:42:41|Jones|alsj|If I remember right, in </i>Moonwalker<i> you said that you had lost a fender in training a time or two; and that you weren't concerned about it when it happened here.&quot;]
147:42:41|Duke|alsj|I don't remember exactly, but it probably did happen; because of, you know, wear and tear on a training vehicle.  You know, operating it every time we went out there to practice.  Things just got loose and we weren't particularly concerned about it when it happened.  See, we didn't even stop to try to pick it up and put it back on.  We just left it.&quot;]
147:42:41|Jones|alsj|And the dust up there on the Moon would have been more of a problem than in any training environment down here.
147:42:41|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
147:42:41|Jones|alsj|So you didn't appreciate how much dust the wheel was going to spray on you.
147:42:41|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  That's right.
147:42:41||alsj|Ron Creel has provided a summary ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.
147:42:59||alsj|Charlie gets the scoop off the gate and hands it to John.
147:43:14|Duke|alsj|We've been around the Rover, now, five minutes or more, just changing out the bags.  It was really a frustrating and a time consuming and a very wasteful effort to change out the SCBs and break out the new ones.  Time is so valuable up there, we really should have put more thought into how we store the individual sample bags and what we do with the design of the doffing and donning of the SCBs.  And, in the future, you really ought to look at some sort of a quick disconnect and connect operation - if you're going to hang 'em on your back.  I personally think the best thing is a little shopping bag deal where you carry it around with you and make it broad enough base so that, when you plop it down, it just stays there.
147:43:14|Jones|alsj|And then just have a little slot on the back of the Rover you can stick it in...
147:43:14|Duke|alsj|Or under the seat where you can just throw it in and leave it.  Or, when you get back, you know, have something permanently there on the Rover that, when you get back, you just pour everything in and that leaves you with the empty bag again.  It turned out it was very, very wasteful of time - more than five minutes here and we didn't get anything done.  We're just screwing around trying to get some fresh bags.
147:43:14|Jones|alsj|This is the worst example of time taken to change bags, but it's not the only example.
147:43:14|Duke|alsj|That's right.
147:43:14||alsj|They started changing the bags at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1473438" target="new" target="alsj">147:34:38</a> and, therefore, spent nearly nine minutes doing what should have been - with well designed equipment -  a quick, simple job.]
147:43:14||alsj|Charlie stows the tongs and the scoop on the gate.
147:43:41||alsj|While Charlie closes the gate, John goes off-camera to the CDR seat.]</i></blockquote>
147:43:52||alsj|The Apollo 17 crew lost the  right-rear fender extension on their Rover at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1185120" target="new" target="alsj">118:51:20</a> when Gene Cernan walked by on his way around the back of the vehicle, got his hammer caught under the fender extension, and tore it off.]</i></blockquote>
147:44:07|Jones|alsj|The dust will become much more of a problem with the fender gone but, do you remember if, up to this point, there were problems with equipment getting fouled with dust?
147:44:07|Duke|alsj|No.  It was more accumulation of stuff, especially our suits.  They got dirtier and dirtier and grittier and grittier; and it was harder and harder to get things locked and unlocked - the gloves and the helmet.   We tried to clean them up as best we could - the seals.  And we had these wipes and stuff when we took 'em off.  But it just got, you know, more and more difficult.  The long-duration stays up there, we're going to have to have good EVA maintenance.  Probably take some spare suits along, certainly spare parts: new seals and stuff like that.  We had a few, minor things, that we could do in repair.  But preventive maintenance of the suits is going to be very, very important.  As far as the hardware goes - and, by that, I mean the lunar experiments - certainly things got dustier and dustier, especially once the fender fell off.  And then, wear and tear on the stuff.  The gnomon, for instance, came apart.  It was a bad design.  John just pulled that out and the whole rod came out and left the tripod down there.  And that not only happened on our flight; it happened on a couple of the other flights, too.  Those kind of things - attention to detail and design.
147:44:07|Jones|alsj|On 17, Jack had a lot of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.sta8.html#1672022" target="new" target="alsj">trouble on the last EVA</a> with the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy45.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">adjustment mechanism</a> on the scoop head.  There were squeeze plates on the sides to change the angle of it; and those were getting pretty badly fouled.&quot;]
147:44:07|Duke|alsj|I don't remember that one in particular, per se, on our flight, but I did notice that the tongs got stiffer and stiffer as they got grittier and grittier in there, as the dust got in and began to bind up the spring mechanism.  The cameras: they continued to work but they were really getting dusty.
147:44:07|Jones|alsj|Hard to read?
147:44:07|Duke|alsj|No.  I don't remember it being hard to read.  But, you know, I was amazed that the cameras kept working, really, because it was a trigger and it was electric motors and stuff like that; but I think the salvation of it all was the fact that the film pack had its own electric motor and the film pack never stayed (in the camera too long)...You know, we changed those out every couple of hours and that was probably the salvation of the thing, because the camera body, and the trigger were really getting dusty.
147:44:07|Jones|alsj|So there were separate electrical systems for the shutter and the film pack?
147:44:07|Duke|alsj|I think the same battery, but separate electrical systems; yeah.
147:44:07|Jones|alsj|Fascinating. I hadn't run across that before.
147:44:07||alsj|Journal Contributor Markus Mehring adds the following comments.  &quot;Regarding the camera motors, I'd say Charlie is wrong here. As far as I know, the magazines didn't have a separate motor or circuitry. The lower camera body contained two Ni-Cd-batteries (with a power reserve for about 2000 photos) and the motor; and this motor was fully responsible for cocking the shutter, triggering the exposure and for film transport. The Hasselblads were specifically designed that way very early in the program, and they didn't change much during Apollo. The magazines were, of course, non-standard, namely bigger than usual; but they contained little more than two open reels for 8-11 meters of film (that is, 140-180 frames, depending on film type and thus film thickness). I think this was a very sensible design (and in retrospect it worked like a charm), and adding a motor and a bunch of cables to the magazines would have meant less photos per magazine, extra load for the batteries and a potential source for technical flaws. Why make it complicated when the simpler design works.&quot;
147:44:07||alsj|On the TV, we see Charlie turn his checklist pages until he gets to  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-15</a> so he can see which of the planned Station 8 activities they completed.]</i></blockquote>
147:44:35||alsj|Charlie checks the 16-mm camera.
147:45:12||alsj|Charlie gets ready to jump into his seat.
147:45:17||alsj|Static;  Long Pause
147:45:17||alsj|TV off.
147:48:12||alsj|Because there was little prospect that Charlie would ever drive the Rover, he is not intimately familiar with the drive systems.]</i></blockquote>

147:48:36||alsj|&quot;Sneak up on one&quot; is a reference to the use of a tool called the Contact Soil Sampling Device, which is shown in  Figure 1 in Judy Allton's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/Welcome.html" target="new" target="alsj">Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools and Containers</a>.  At Station 9, John will open the tool and then will slowly approach a boulder from the direction of the LM - hence Charlie's &quot;sneak up on one&quot;.  Once John gets to the boulder, he will reach over the top and press the tool on the surface on the other side.  The idea is to collect a surface soil sample undisturbed by the LM descent engine plume.  See the sketch on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-16.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-16</a>.]</i></blockquote>
147:49:02||alsj|As indicated on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR16-17.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-17</a>, the photo-analysts had expected that John and Charlie would find numerous small fault scarps and the notation &quot;NE Scarp&quot; probably means that Houston wanted John to find a northeast/southwest trending scarp, down-thrown on the southeast (that is, with the vertical face facing southeast), and park so that the scarp would have provided some shielding of the sample area from the LM descent plume.  John is laughing because he is pleased that the Backroom now believes his contention that there are no scarps in the area.  Now, what they are looking for is a shallow crater - one that John can drive into but which may, also, provide some shielding.
147:49:02||alsj|John and Charlie are skeptical that they will be able to find an area free of South Ray ejecta.]</i></blockquote>

147:51:19||alsj|A 'hollah' is a 'hollow'.
147:51:19|Duke|alsj|I'm speaking Southern, here!
147:51:38||alsj|What Charlie is trying to say is that the boulder is on the north wall of the crater.  The &quot;side facing the LM&quot; would be the south wall, as would the &quot;side of the crater away from the LM&quot;. The important point, of course, is that John and Charlie know what they are looking for.]
147:51:38||alsj|Charlie may have taken frame AS16-108-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17713" target="new" target="alsj">17713</a> as John was coming up out of the crater on the northeast side.  This is the last frame of the drive to Station 9.
147:54:31||alsj|The Nav system has not been working properly since John and Charlie left Station 8.  The Station 9 location plotted in Figure 1 in the Stone Mountain chapter of the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a> is based on analysis of photos taken at Station 9 and indicates a position near  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">BP.8/77.7</a>.  This location is 600 meters north of Station 8.]
147:54:31||alsj|The interval from the time John started driving at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1474815" target="new" target="alsj">147:48:15</a> to the time he started maneuvering to find a parking place at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1475124" target="new" target="alsj">147:51:24</a> was 3 minutes 9 seconds and, at 10 km/hr, they would have covered about 525 meters, a figure in good agreement with the plotted location.  If we use the bearing and range readouts Charlie just gave, the inferred position is BN.3/79.0, a spot about 400 meters northeast of Station 8.  However, the photos Charlie took during the traverse indicate that John drove toward the north - and sometimes the northwest -  during most of the traverse.  For a discussion of the Nav system failure, see the text at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvlm2.html#1484448" target="new" target="alsj">148:44:48</a>.] </i></blockquote>
147:54:50||alsj|Charlie has probably fallen.  John probably goes around the front of the Rover to help him up.
||alsj|While John aligns the high-gain antenna, Charlie is probably scanning the Contact Surface Sample page in his cuff checklist, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-16.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-16</a>, and the facing Station 9 page, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-17.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-17</a>.

147:55:39||alsj|Charlie's &quot;Ha, ha&quot; is probably anticipation of John sneaking up on a boulder, as described below.
147:55:39||alsj|TV on.
147:55:57||alsj|The TV camera is pointing ENE.  Note the foreground Rover tracks and the dip they reveal.  Without the tracks in the picture, the dip would be all but invisible.
147:56:26||alsj|Tony was listening to a conversation about proposed changes in the Rover switch configuration and missed John's question.  Without waiting for an answer, John comes around and uses the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">large dustbrush</a> to clean the TV lens.  After John finishes, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> starts a clockwise pan.

147:56:26||alsj|They are about to do some special soil sampling.  As shown in the sketch on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp112.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-16</a>, they will select a large rock and will do the sampling on the southwest side of the rock, away from the LM and the Rover.  As indicated on page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp185.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">185</a> in the Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, they want to collect samples of pristine surface materials and three potential types of contamination of the sampling site are the LM Descent Engine exhaust, water vapor given off by the PLSSs as John and Charlie work around the Rover, material John might kick onto the sample site as he approaches.  These three types of contamination can be minimized by collecting the sample at a considerable distance from the LM (more than one kilometer was suggested by the PI); parking the Rover on the LM-ward side of a rock; approaching the rock carefully to avoid kicking soil over the rock; and, finally, reaching over the rock and collecting the samples on the far side.  As suggested by the dialog over the next several minutes, there were also concerns about contaminating the business end of the sampling tool with either dust coming off the suits as John and Charlie moved around and by the water vapor exhaust of the PLSSs.  Both sources could be avoided by not pointing the business end at either suit.
147:56:26||alsj|The 'Surface Samples' will be collected with a tool called the Contact Soil Sampling device, which is shown in Figure  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy01.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1</a> in Judy Allton's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/Welcome.html" target="new" target="alsj">Tool Book</a>.  The sampler head consists of two halves connected by a hinge, rather like the covers of a hardback book.  As shown at the upper left of the figure, a handle is attached to what we might think of as the front cover.  Once John is in position next to the rock, he will open the back cover and secure it to the handle with a strip of Velcro.  This exposes the inside of the front cover, which is covered with a sample pad made of so-called &quot;Beta cloth&quot;, which is woven from a Teflon-coated yarn.  John will then reach across the rock and press the Beta-cloth pad on the surface and, in principle, will lift off particles making up the upper 100 micrometers of the surface.  John will then close the Beta-cloth sampler, secure it with the Velcro strap - as shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy02.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2</a> - and replace it with a sampler containing a pad made of white-nylon velvet.  He will then reach over the rock a second time and press that sampler on a fresh spot and, in principle, will collect particles making up the top 1 mm of the surface.  Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-KSC-72PC-141.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-72PC-141</a> shows John practicing with the Contact Soil Sampler at the Cape.]</i></blockquote>
147:56:26||alsj|John crosses the TV picture from right to left, going to the CDR seat.]
147:56:26||alsj|John will approach the rock very slowly to avoid kicking soil on the sampling area on the far side of the rock.  During training, this became known as &quot;sneaking up on a rock.&quot;  Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-KSC-72PC-140.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-72PC-140</a> shows John has he reaches over a boulder at the Cape so he can press the sampler on the surface.]
147:56:26|Jones|alsj|I take it that you guys had an awful lot of fun with this in training.&quot;]
147:56:26|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  It was the biggest joke.  (Laughing)  We were just going to sneak up on that rock, you know.  They wanted </i>absolutely<i> undisturbed surface, you see, so we were supposed to tippy-toe...When they first told us that, we just started giggling, so we made it into a joke where we were going to tippy-toe...So, in practice, we did like the Keystone Kops - you know, you sneak, sneak, in silent movies you always knew you were sneaking because you could watch...&quot;]
147:56:26|Jones|alsj|Up on your toes...
147:56:26|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  That's what we did in training.  And the whole purpose was to reach over this rock so, as we walked up, we didn't kick dust on to the sample; so, by reaching over the rock - if we had walked up and kicked, the rock would have stopped it and we still would have had a pristine sample out there.  And, so, to make sure we weren't kicking up any dust, we were going to sneak up on it, you see.  So we just had a big kick out of it during training, so this was our sneak maneuver.  And it was just a lot of fun.&quot;]
147:56:26|Jones|alsj|Well, let me tell you, the first time I heard this tape - or the first time I read this stuff - I had absolutely no idea what was going on.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
147:57:41||alsj|It is not clear whether John said &quot;Bus B&quot; or &quot;Bus D&quot;.  Someone in Houston thinks he heard John say &quot;Bus B&quot; and tries to call attention to the fact but, for the moment, is ignored.  In Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1-22</a> in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>, the circuit breakers on the left side under the heading indicator and Batt 2 has breakers only for Bus C and Bus D, making it likely that John actually pulled the Bus D breaker, a supposition which is confirmed at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1482859" target="new" target="alsj">148:28:59</a>.  Tony should have said &quot;Dog&quot; to avoid confusion, and John should have called him on it.  Note, that just before John drives away from Station 9 at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1482811" target="new" target="alsj">148:28:11</a>, Houston has him switch all the steering and the rear drive power to Bus B and, on that occasion, Tony uses proper procedure and refers to it as &quot;Bus Baker&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
147:58:03||alsj|The Core Sample Vacuum Container is shown in Figure  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy76.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">76</a> in Judy Allton's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/Welcome.html" target="new" target="alsj">Tool Book</a>.

Charlie has made several verbal errors during the last few minutes, a possible indicator of fatigue.]</i></blockquote>
147:59:00||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat.  He is holding the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
147:59:12||alsj|Despite Charlie's suggestion, Fendell continues the clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
147:59:19||alsj|Fendell starts to pan counter-clockwise (left) while Charlie turns to his left to look toward John.]</i></blockquote>
147:59:30||alsj|By not opening the sampler head until the last minute, all forms of contamination can be minimized.
147:59:35||alsj|John could be asking about instructions from the experiment PI or about instructions from Tony he might not have heard.]</i></blockquote>
147:59:39||alsj|Charlie seems to be talking about pre-flight discussions about procedures to avoid contamination.
147:59:43||alsj|Charlie is probably saying that he will get the skim and scoop samples after John finishes with the pad samples.]
147:59:43||alsj|Fendell stops panning left and resumes the clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>
147:59:55||alsj|Although it is possible that Tony is telling John to have his back to the LM before he opens the sampler head, it seems more likely that he is telling him to avoid opening the sampler in such a way that the pads are pointed toward his own suit.
148:00:02||alsj|Fred Haise is the Apollo 16 backup Commander, who may be sitting with Tony.  Tony's comment implies that dust coming off the suits is a major concern.
148:00:12||alsj|Fendell has stopped the clockwise pan.  The view is across the left rear fender.  As indicated below, Fendell is confused as to just where John is. John is actually on the other side of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
148:00:18||alsj|Fendell pans farther right, and gets a view of the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>
148:00:30||alsj|In Houston, Fendell asks, &quot;Which way did he go?  He said I was going the wrong way, and I went the other way.&quot;  Obviously, he missed Charlie's &quot;If you'll pan left...&quot; at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1475903" target="new" target="alsj">147:59:03</a>.]</i></blockquote>
148:00:37||alsj|Fendell pans left.
148:01:01||alsj|John doesn't want to point the open sample pad toward Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
148:01:08||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie southwest of the Rover  and a few meters north of the meter-sized rock John snuck up on.  As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy03.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3</a> in Judy Allton's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/Welcome.html" target="new" target="alsj">Tool Book</a>, there is only a small amount of soil on the pad, all of it along the right edge.]</i></blockquote>
148:01:28||alsj|Fendell zooms in.  John is trying to remove the Beta-cloth sampler, which he has undoubtedly closed already.  Charlie plants the scoop and moves in to help.]</i></blockquote>
148:01:40||alsj|Charlie takes the sampler in his right hand and holds it steady while John frees the handle.  Charlie then gives John the second sampling head, the one with the velvet pad.]</i></blockquote>
148:02:10||alsj|Charlie helps John free the Velcro strap that is holding the sampler head closed.  John turns to face the rock and Charlie backs off to the left.]</i></blockquote>
148:02:25||alsj|Charlie plants the left foot, picks up the trailing foot, brings it forward, well clear of the ground, by rotating his body to the left, and plants his right foot a foot or so in front of the left, and so on.  It is a very deliberate, slow walk.
148:02:34||alsj|Although John has his back to us, it is apparent that he has been having trouble getting the sampler ready.]</i></blockquote>
148:02:36||alsj|John is finally ready and approaches the rock carefully, although not with quite the exaggerated motion Charlie demonstrated. Charlie goes around to the east side of the rock to watch.  This suggests that PLSS exhaust is not a major concern.]</i></blockquote>
148:02:42||alsj|John leans to his right as he reaches over the rock and tries to lower the pad vertically toward the surface on the far side.]</i></blockquote>
148:02:52||alsj|John stands and swings the sampler head up to his right and rests the bottom part of the handle on his left hand.
148:03:03||alsj|Charlie now has a view of the pad.
148:03:05||alsj|Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy03.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3</a> from Judy Allton's Tool Book shows the Beta-cloth pad, which has lunar soil along the right edge.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy04.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4</a> shows the velvet pad, which has soil adhering to a relatively large patch at the lower right.  Journal Contributor Simon Atkinson notes that the two imprints John will make with the sampler can be seen in photos AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17561" target="new" target="alsj">17561</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17562" target="new" target="alsj">17562</a> that John takes at 148:07:43.  An <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16det17561.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">enhanced detail</a> of 17561 gives us a view into the shadow. A comparison of the faint marks left by the sampling pads with the post-flight photos of the pads suggests that the sunlit imprint was made by the Beta cloth sample pad.]</i></blockquote>
148:03:13||alsj|John is saying that he wasn't able to find a smooth, level surface on the south side of the rock.]</i></blockquote>
148:03:24||alsj|After John gets the sampler closed, he turns to his left to face Charlie, who steps in to help.  Charlie grabs the sampler head and John removes the handle without difficulty.]</i></blockquote>
148:03:39||alsj|Charlie steps to his right so he can open John's SCB.  Before opening it, he makes sure the sampler head is securely closed.]</i></blockquote>
148:03:48||alsj|Charlie tries to open John's SCB.
148:03:53||alsj|As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-21.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-21</a>, the SCB which is currently on the Hand Tool Carrier at the back of the Rover is the one that is supposed to go in the SRC.  Charlie is saying that that SCB is already full of samples.
148:04:02||alsj|Charlie is having trouble getting the SCB open.]</i></blockquote>
148:04:09||alsj|Charlie finally gets John's SCB open, stows the samplers, closes the SCB, and then hops around John to get the scoop.  He is going to collect a skim sample on the southeast side of the rock.
148:04:18||alsj|Charlie tries to position the scoop so he can plant it next to the east side of the rock to serve as a gnomon.  It takes him a few seconds to get a position he likes and, during that time, it isn't obvious to John what he is doing.
148:04:34||alsj|Charlie gets the scoop planted and backs up to get the down-Sun.]</i></blockquote>
148:04:44||alsj|Charlie waves toward the south side of the boulder.]</i></blockquote>
148:04:49||alsj|John runs south between Charlie and the rock, carrying the UHT.  Charlie turns to his right to get some light on his camera settings.]</i></blockquote>
148:04:58||alsj|Evidently, the sampler handle is one of the ALSEP Universal Handling Tools (UHT).]</i></blockquote>
148:05:00||alsj|John was facing the rock and, with the UHT in his right hand, rapidly turns to his left and releases it.  It sails out of the field-of-view to the left.]</i></blockquote>
148:05:11||alsj|There is a sizable crater in the middle distance.]</i></blockquote>
148:05:11||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun &quot;after&quot; is AS16-108-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17740" target="new" target="alsj">17740</a>.
148:05:19||alsj|When John released the UHT, it started rotating rapidly around it's midpoint and Tony's reference is to the behavior of Australian boomerangs which, of course, depend on airflow over their curved bodies to achieve curved flight.
148:05:19||alsj|While John takes a cross-Sun stereopair from the south, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17558" target="new" target="alsj">17558</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17559" target="new" target="alsj">17559</a>, Charlie runs around behind him and takes a locator, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17741" target="new" target="alsj">17741</a>.] </i></blockquote>
148:05:40||alsj|Charlie is probably pleased that he got John in the picture.]</i></blockquote>
148:05:42||alsj|John has backed up about two meters and leans back to raise his camera for AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17560" target="new" target="alsj">17560</a>.  The LM may be the object just above and to the left of the flat-topped boulder which is on the near horizon above and slightly to the left of the scoop handle.]</i></blockquote>
148:05:58||alsj|John thinks they are finished with the soil sampling.
148:05:58|Jones|alsj|Can you tell me where the phrase 'that fills that square' comes from?&quot;]
148:05:58|Duke|alsj|Well, in the military, you have a set of requirements you've got to do to, like, stay current in an airplane.  You need so many landings, you need so many approaches, you need so many whatevers.  So they have a matrix, you know; and across the top you have columns and the horizontal axis it might be the dates or something like that.  And when you get one, you filled the square; you'd make a check mark and that was called 'filling the square'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
148:06:05||alsj|Charlie gets the scoop.
148:06:19||alsj|Charlie backs away from the rock to the south a meter or two and then hops sideways to his left around to the west side of the rock.
148:06:23||alsj|Charlie is getting the sample in the shadow of the rock and John is pointing out that the area won't show up well in the photographs.]</i></blockquote>
148:06:30||alsj|John gets a bag ready while Charlie raises the skim sample and starts pouring it in.
148:06:30||alsj|In Houston, Flight is told that Charlie, in particular, isn't using his cooling water and oxygen nearly as fast as during EVA-1 and that a 7-hour 35 EVA can be done comfortably.]</i></blockquote>
148:07:43||alsj|John takes a stereopair from the south, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17561" target="new" target="alsj">17561</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17562" target="new" target="alsj">17562</a>, stepping to his right between frames.

148:07:52||alsj|John steps farther to his right and takes a third picture of the area, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17563" target="new" target="alsj">17563</a>.  A &quot;flightline stereo&quot; is a sequence of pictures taken while the astronaut moves sideways, step-by-step and frame-by-frame.  Each pair of successive frames forms a stereopair.]
148:07:52||alsj|Next, John gets a bag ready while Charlie gets and raises the sample.]</i></blockquote>
148:08:01||alsj|John is having trouble getting a bag loose.  Note that John still has the skim sample bag in his left hand.
148:08:10||alsj|Charlie pours the deep sample.
148:08:10|Jones|alsj|It looks like you had to shake the scoop to get the soil to go into the bag.  Did it tend to stick?
148:08:10|Duke|alsj|Sometimes; yeah.  Well, if you'll notice there, that angle where I had it, it wasn't enough gravity to pull it out; so you had shake it.  Normally, if you could turn it over (demonstrating by raising an imaginary scoop past vertical) like that, it would all fall out, because there was nothing to cause it to stick; but (there was) surface tension between the soils and the shovel, even though it was polished aluminum.  There was some tension there and, so, at that little low angle that I had there, you needed to shake it out.  But, generally, you didn't have to.
148:08:30||alsj|Charlie presents his SCB and, after sealing bag 377, John stows both 376 and 377.
148:08:59||alsj|In Houston, Jim Lovell, the Backroom spokesman, tells Flight that they want the CSVC next.
148:09:00||alsj|While Charlie heads for the Rover, John takes a stereopair of the rock from the south, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17564" target="new" target="alsj">17564</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17565" target="new" target="alsj">17565</a>.  David Harland has assembled a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.1480903_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">mosaic</a> consisting of frames 17560, 17564, and 17573.  The first two are post-sneak pictures of the rock showing John's footprints and the sampler imprints, and the last shows the boulder after John tips it over.] </i></blockquote>
148:09:10||alsj|John takes a stereopair from the northeast, AS16-107-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17566" target="new" target="alsj">17566</a> and  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17567" target="new" target="alsj">17567</a>.] </i></blockquote>
148:09:30||alsj|John reaches down and gets the hammer out of his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.
148:09:32||alsj|John takes a position south of the rock and hits the rock at least ten times.  While he does so, Fendell zooms in on a rock in background that is sitting on top of nearby ridge.
148:10:01||alsj|We see the top of John's PLSS as he crosses from left to right, presumably in pursuit of a fragment he chipped off the rock.
148:10:01||alsj|In Houston, Flight tells Fendell that he wants to watch John turn over the rock.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom.]</i></blockquote>
148:10:14||alsj|John drops to his right knee and grabs the fragment.  He nearly loses his balance as he gets up.  He grunts with the effort and, then, as he walks forward, the pack of sample bags falls off his camera.
148:10:32||alsj|John backs away from the bags and then runs forward, drops to his right knee with his left foot forward, grabs the bags, and rises without difficulty.  He heads for the Rover.
148:11:03||alsj|Charlie has run out to get the hammer.  He comes into view at the right side of the picture.
148:11:07||alsj|While Charlie goes west away from the Rover to find a spot to drive the core, John stops and tries to re-attach the bag dispenser to his camera.
148:11:18||alsj|John gets the dispenser attached, gets a bag, and bags the sample he picked up at 148:10:15.  In the background, Charlie pushes the core partway into the ground.
148:11:18||alsj|Charlie backs up and takes a cross-Sun stereopair from the south, AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17742" target="new" target="alsj">17742</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17743" target="new" target="alsj">17743</a>.] </i></blockquote>
148:11:45||alsj|While Charlie takes his pictures, John takes the boulder fragment to the Rover.
148:11:46||alsj|This is sample 69935, a 128-gram breccia shown in Figure 93C in the Professional Paper.
148:12:04||alsj|Journal Contributor David Harland notes that the Apollo 16 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> states that sample 69935 is in bag 378 and bag 373 has been used already for sample 60075, which Charlie collected at the ALSEP site prior to the traverse to Station 1.  Here at Station 9, John has previously used bags 376 and 377  and, even though he has just dropped the bags and then retrieved them, it is likely that he has misread 378 as 373.  Readers should also note that bag number 373 also appears briefly in the Station 1 dialog at<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta1.html#1233312" target="new" target="alsj">123:33:12</a>, where John tells Tony that he and Charlie are using 373, only to be corrected by Charlie, who notes that the bag is really 372.
148:12:04||alsj|John crosses the screen from left to right, headed for the boulder.  Charlie hits the extension handle four times with the flat of the hammer.  On the fourth blow, the hammer twists in his hand.  He stops, re-aligns the hammer, delivers four more blows, and steps back.
148:12:29||alsj|Charlie pulls the core out with his left hand and then rotates the tip up to his right and balances it on his right hand with the tip pointing up to keep the soil from running out.
148:12:30||alsj|Off-camera, John has taken a series of photos of the boulder.
148:12:30||alsj|AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17566" target="new" target="alsj">17566</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17567" target="new" target="alsj">17567</a> are a stereopair from the northeast.]
148:12:30||alsj|Frames  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17568" target="new" target="alsj">17568</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17569" target="new" target="alsj">17569</a> are a stereopair from the north.]
148:12:30||alsj|Frames <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17570" target="new" target="alsj">17570</a> is from the east.]
148:12:30||alsj|John then raised his camera to take  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17571" target="new" target="alsj">17571</a>.]
148:12:30||alsj|Next, he will take a picture from the southwest, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17572" target="new" target="alsj">17572</a>, that shows the sample location on the top of the rock.]
148:12:30||alsj|Charlie heads for the back of the Rover.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom and follows.]
148:12:30|Jones|alsj|While you're running, here, you catch your toe on little ripples on the surface.  Did you get a feeling that you'd start to rotate forward?&quot;]
148:12:30|Duke|alsj|No; not then.  You had to hit something a little bit more substantial.  If you hit a rock like that, of course, you'd stumble; but the dust, you didn't even feel it, really.&quot;]
148:12:30|Jones|alsj|So, it was too loose to really have much of an effect?&quot;]
148:12:30|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
148:13:14||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
148:13:23||alsj|Fendell pans left, looking for John.
148:14:12||alsj|Fendell finds John taking the first picture, a down-Sun stereopair of the tipped boulder, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17575" target="new" target="alsj">17575</a>.  He then moves to his right and takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17576" target="new" target="alsj">17576</a>.  He has already taken a cross-Sun stereopair consisting of frames <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17573" target="new" target="alsj">17573</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17574" target="new" target="alsj">17574</a>.  In the down-Suns, note that, because of the low Sun angle, it is all but impossible to pick out the boulder imprint.]</i></blockquote>
148:14:18||alsj|John runs toward the back of the Rover.
148:14:36||alsj|As Charlie heads out to join him, John stops, turns, and runs toward the boulder.]</i></blockquote>
148:14:50||alsj|As Charlie runs toward the boulder, using a loping stride for a change, he gets good elevation and speed.  His form is similar to the form he showed early in the ALSEP deployment.  He is showing no signs of fatigue.]</i></blockquote>
148:14:51||alsj|As John and Charlie approach the boulder, they slow to a walk and then stop to look at the imprint.]</i></blockquote>
148:15:04||alsj|Charlie takes the hammer out of his shin pocket.]</i></blockquote>
148:15:14||alsj|Charlie gives the hammer to John.
148:15:24||alsj|Charlie digs deeply into the boulder imprint.]</i></blockquote>
148:15:32||alsj|John puts the hammer on the boulder and gets a bag ready while Charlie raises the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
148:15:53||alsj|Charlie stuck the tip of the scoop head in the bag and then rotated the handle up to pour.  Evidently, some of the sample wouldn't come off the scoop because John uses his free hand to grab the scoop head and shake it.
148:15:53|Jones|alsj|The two of you never seem to have any particular trouble getting these soil samples in the bags with you manipulating the scoop, John holding the bags.  That all seemed to go fairly well.&quot;]
148:15:53|Duke|alsj|Yeah; right.
148:15:53|Jones|alsj|Gene and Jack sometimes had a bit of trouble.  Jack was the one who used the scoop; he's the shorter one. And it sometimes got a little awkward.
148:15:53|Duke|alsj|Well, I was the taller one; so, when I used the shovel, it was easier.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
148:16:05||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair from the south, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17577" target="new" target="alsj">17577</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17578" target="new" target="alsj">17578</a>.  He then folds the bag shut and turns toward Charlie, who has forgotten to present his SCB.  He does so now.  After stowing the sample, John turns toward the boulder and gets the hammer.  Charlie turns to watch.] </i></blockquote>
148:16:33||alsj|John kneels on the north side of the rock and delivers sideways blows to the edge of a light-colored piece that appears to project off the northeastern face.  He hits the rock eight times without success.]</i></blockquote>
148:16:49||alsj|The thirteenth blow breaks off a piece.  The fragment flies off the boulder, but straight toward the ground.  John stands.]</i></blockquote>
148:16:50||alsj|John backs away to the north to get his shadow off the fragment.]</i></blockquote>
148:17:10||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop near the sample and, holding the handle in his left hand, walks around it and then backwards until his feet are extended well behind him and he has most of his weight on the scoop. He reaches down slowly and carefully to grab the fragment.]</i></blockquote>
148:17:12||alsj|As he forces himself lower, Charlie finally rests his right knee on the ground and begins to lift his left knee so he can get some rotation down to the right.]</i></blockquote>
148:17:21||alsj|Charlie finally has a grip on the fragment.  He pushes back on the scoop and gets his full weight on both knees.  Before the suit pitches him forward, he pulls the scoop out of the ground and then re-plants it just in front of his knees.  In the process, he gets some soil on his legs.]</i></blockquote>
148:17:24||alsj|Charlie pushes back on the scoop and rises without trouble.]
148:17:24|Jones|alsj|This is a real nice example of the advantages of having a little support and making use of a slope.&quot;]
148:17:24|Duke|alsj|Yeah, it sloped away.  I sort of put my feet down below the shovel, and so I could push back on it.  Once you got up over your knees, the bend in suit gave you more spring and you were able to spring up easier.&quot;]
148:17:24|Jones|alsj|And did the slope also help you get down into the kneeling position?&quot;]
148:17:24|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Yeah; it did.
148:17:30||alsj|While John gets a bag out, Charlie examines the fragment.]</i></blockquote>
148:17:30||alsj|This is sample 69955, a piece of crystalline rock with an included vein of glass.  It is shown in Figure 95C in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.]
148:17:30||alsj|John puts his left foot back, leans forward so he can see his shin pocket, opens it, and stows the hammer.  He then holds the bag out for Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
148:18:20||alsj|Because John is the one who has color film and takes the cross-Sun &quot;afters&quot;, Charlie holds the scoop against the rock face to provide scale.]</i></blockquote>
148:18:25||alsj|John adjusts his camera settings and then takes a stereopair, AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17579" target="new" target="alsj">17579</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17580" target="new" target="alsj">17580</a>.  As Charlie mentions in a moment, John is about 5 feet from the rock.]</i></blockquote>
148:18:53||alsj|Charlie presents his SCB.
148:18:54||alsj|While John stows the sample and secures the top of Charlie's SCB, Charlie straightens the scoop head.]</i></blockquote>
148:19:23||alsj|Houston's concern is that, when they get back in the LM, the OPS will be hot to the touch.  Charlie plants the scoop and leans forward but the flap is still out of reach for John.  Charlie bends his knees, but it is still a reach for John.]
148:19:23||alsj|Once they are back in the cabin and John is taking his gloves off at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2post.html#1500556" target="alsj">150:05:56</a>, Tony reminds John of the possibility.  John reports that Charlie's OPS is 'cool as a cucumber'.]</i></blockquote>
148:19:38||alsj|Charlie heads for the Rover and John follows.]</i></blockquote>
148:19:51||alsj|John stops and turns to face the boulder again.]</i></blockquote>
148:19:56||alsj|John heads for the Rover and Fendell pans left.  Note that John struggles a bit as he comes out of a shallow depression.  Although he and Charlie have plenty of reserve energy, they are both showing occasional signs of fatigue.  Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-4a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-4(a)</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission Report shows John's EVA-2 heart rate and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-4b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-4(b)</a> shows Charlie's.  Both of them are currently showing heart rates of about 90 beats per minute.]</i></blockquote>
148:21:18||alsj|Fendell zooms in on a flat rock that is sticking up, diagonally, out of the soil east of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
148:21:29||alsj|Charlie is concerned that he won't be able to seal the top of the CSVC, which is shown in Figure  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy76.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">76</a> in Judy Allton's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/Welcome.html" target="new" target="alsj">Tool Book</a>.  Like the Special Environmental Sample Container (SESC), which is shown in Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy92.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">92</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy93.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">93</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy94.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">94</a> in Judy's Tool Book - the CSVC is designed to hold a vacuum so that the sample can be analyzed for volatile content.]</i></blockquote>
148:21:40||alsj|As Fendell pulls back on the zoom and resumes the counter-clockwise pan, note the northbound Rover tracks in the foreground.  John made these as he approached the Station.  Station 9 is roughly a kilometer west of the path John followed on the southbound trip to Stone Mountain.
148:22:18||alsj|Fendell stops the pan and zooms in on a small, steep-walled crater northeast of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
148:23:00||alsj|As Fendell pulls back on the zoom, we see John at the back of the Rover.  We know this is John because he has his SCB on the left side of his PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
148:23:11||alsj|They are planning to do Station 10 midway between the LM and the ALSEP site.]</i></blockquote>
148:23:22||alsj|John goes to the CDR seat and then stops and looks up at Stone Mountain.
148:23:42||alsj|John goes off-camera to the right, probably intending to turn the TV off.
148:24:23||alsj|John returns to the CDR seat and raises it.]</i></blockquote>
148:24:34||alsj|Charlie takes AS16-108- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17744" target="new" target="alsj">17744</a>, which shows the handcontroller and John standing on the far side, and 745, a lightstruck picture of Stone Mountain.
148:24:34||alsj|John turns toward the TV camera and takes AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17581" target="new" target="alsj">17581</a>, an excellent picture which shows the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>, the closed battery covers, the uncovered LCRU mirrors, and the TV.  He then turns and takes a picture or two toward Stone Mountain.  Frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17582" target="new" target="alsj">17582</a> is lightstruck.]</i></blockquote>
148:24:45||alsj|The last frame taken on magazine Bravo was AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18441" target="new" target="alsj">18441</a>, a picture of the LM shadow in the area of the UV camera taken just before the end of EVA-1.  Delta (115) is a fresh magazine.]</i></blockquote>
148:25:05||alsj|John has been trying, without success, to remove the used magazine from his camera.
148:25:13||alsj|John lifts the used magazine (107/C) out of his camera and puts it in his seatpan.  The new magazines are also in the CDR seatpan.]</i></blockquote>
148:25:25||alsj|John hands magazine Delta across the seats to Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
148:25:38||alsj|Charlie got two useful frames as he advanced the film.  AS16-115- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18471" target="new" target="alsj">18471</a> is a lightstruck picture of the handcontroller.  John is on the other side of the Rover changing his film magazine.  In <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18472" target="new" target="alsj">18472</a>, we see John putting a film magazine (114/B)  in his camera.  Note the other film magazines in the cloth-enclosed storage area under John's seat.  The magazines are quite large because they each hold 170 frames of 70mm film.  Under John's camera, we can see his sample bag dispenser and, also, the Red Apple he would pull to activate his purge valve in an emergency.]
148:25:38||alsj|In the TV record, we see John putting magazine Bravo in his camera.]
148:25:38||alsj|In Houston, Flight tells the Surgeon, &quot;We're looking at an EVA capability, here, of 7 plus 35 (7 hours 35 minutes) on the PLSS.  What do you think of that?&quot;  The Surgeon responds, &quot;Well, I think they're pretty tired.  They're showing a lot of fatigue.  I just wonder if it's advisable to push 'em that long.&quot;  Flight responds, &quot;Well, okay, it's not a matter of adding anything here; it's just giving them a little more time to finish up what we've got scheduled.  I'm not going to add other tasks.  I just don't want them to think they've got to rush through what we've got left.&quot;  The Surgeon's response is lost under Charlie, but Flight tells him to think about it during the drive to Station 10.  The EVA will actually end at 7 hours 24 minutes.]
148:25:38||alsj|John turns to his left so he can advance the film and get some pictures of Stone Mountain in the process.  As he turns, the sample-bag dispenser falls off his camera]</i></blockquote>
148:26:28||alsj|John kneels to get the bags and appears to be steadying himself by holding on to the Rover.  He rises with them after a few seconds.  As he holds up the bags, note that they are orange in transmitted light.  Charlie has joined him and takes the bags.
148:26:59||alsj|Charlie finishes attaching the bags to John's camera and goes off-camera to the right, headed for the LMP seat.
148:27:09||alsj|Apparently, Charlie is just off-camera to the right and has used his finger to raise John's lens to get a good look at it.]</i></blockquote>
148:27:10||alsj|While Charlie goes to the LMP seat, John takes a picture of Stone Mountain, AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18444" target="new" target="alsj">18444</a>.] </i></blockquote>
148:27:22||alsj|Previously, Charlie ran the 16-mm camera at 1 frame per second.  At 12 frames per second, he doesn't want to waste film by turning the camera on now.
148:27:47||alsj|TV off.
148:27:58||alsj|John may be referring to the fact that the TV camera is already pointed aft.]</i></blockquote>
148:28:20||alsj|At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1475731" target="new" target="alsj">147:57:31</a>, shortly after John and Charlie arrived at Station 9, Houston asked John to pull the Battery 2 Bus D circuit breaker and there was some possible confusion caused by the fact that Tony said &quot;Bus D&quot; rather than &quot;Bus Dog&quot;.  Here, Tony avoids confusion, at least in this regard, by saying &quot;Bus Baker&quot;.
148:28:31||alsj|Charlie's confusion is caused by the fact that, while the rear steering can be on either Bus B or Bus D, the forward steering can only be on Bus A or Bus C.

What Tony is probably trying to say is that they should do Station 10 northeast of the Central Station but well beyond the mortar package, as indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.]</i></blockquote>

148:31:54||alsj|Charlie is probably referring to the bearing indicator.<p> When they arrived at Station 9, they were at a bearing/range of 007/2.6 and a map location near BP.8/77.7.  Unbeknownst to the crew, the circuit breaker and switch changes they made at Station 8 and, possibly, here at Station 9 have disabled the Nav system.  Consequently, the bearing and range won't change during the drive back to the LM. See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1484448" target="new" target="alsj">148:44:48</a>.]</i></blockquote>
148:31:54||alsj|As Charlie discovers at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1484211" target="new" target="alsj">148:42:11</a>, he didn't actually get the DAC turned on and, consequently, there is no coverage of the first half of the drive back to the LM.
148:32:18||alsj|This is a reprise of a conversation John and Tony had at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvlm1.html#1250843" target="new" target="alsj">125:08:43</a> during the drive back to the LM at the end of EVA-1.
148:32:36||alsj|Charlie may be referring to the feature labeled Eden Valley on the &quot;Descartes EVA-I, II 1 of 2 map&quot; at BX.5/72.5.  Eden Valley shows up quite clearly in the pan camera frames taken from the Command Module.  See Figure 5 in the Traverse Planning chapter of the Professional Paper.  A comparison of Figure 23 in the Stone Mountain chapter and Figure 3 of the Central Region chapter indicates that they are currently at about the same elevation as the southern rim of Eden Valley and, if that is true, then he probably isn't seeing into the crater.  Eden Valley is about 2 kilometers north of their current location.]</i></blockquote>
148:32:36||alsj|Note that Charlie hadn't yet noticed that the bearing and range to the LM haven't changed since they left Station 9.]</i></blockquote>
148:33:20||alsj|They have been driving for about 3.5 minutes and, at 10 km/hr, would be about 600 meters north of Station 9.  The depression is probably the one between Station 9 and Sunset Crater in Figure 5 in the Traverse Planning Chapter in the Professional Paper.  If so, Charlie's estimate of a 300-meter diameter is quite accurate.  The center of the crater is near BR/79.  This may be the feature shown in AS16-115-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18482" target="new" target="alsj">18482</a>.
148:33:20||alsj|During our mission review, Charlie and I used the &quot;Descartes EVA-II, 1 of 2&quot; map to try to locate this feature.  There is far less detail on that map compared with what can be seen in the pan camera photography taken from the Command Module.  Nonetheless, Charlie was able to identify the depression.]
148:33:20|Jones|alsj|During the third Apollo 15 EVA, when Dave and Jim were driving toward the rille, they ran into two or three of these big, shallow, subtle things that hadn't been on the maps at all.
148:33:20|Duke|alsj|Well, we did, too.  This area was one of them.  It's all so subdued and flat that it doesn't look like anything.  This is probably what we're talking about; we're probably right in here (BR/78.8).  And now you can see, as you look, it's probably these old, subdued craters right in here.&quot;]
148:33:20|Jones|alsj|Just to the south and a little bit west of Sunset Crater.&quot;]
148:33:20|Duke|alsj|Or we could be out in here.  There's another one...See, the ridges are running sort of this way...
148:33:20|Jones|alsj|The ridge lines are going northeast/southwest.  And then the two things you were pointing at: one of them's at about BR/78.8 and the other one's at about BP/78.8.&quot;]
148:33:20||alsj|Charlie then tried to use the bearing and range figures in the transcript to check himself but then said, &quot;But I think that the thing's been busted, so we're right around in here where Merriam is.&quot;]
148:33:20||alsj|The center of Merriam Crater is at BQ.9/80.7, but what Charlie was indicating on the map was the feature west of Merriam and BR/79.]</i></blockquote>
148:33:28|Jones|alsj|Is this a reference to pre-landing passes over the site?
148:33:28|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  Uh-huh.
148:33:28|Jones|alsj|As with the other J-missions, you used the Command Module engine to put you in the descent orbit before you undocked the LM.  Right?&quot;]
148:33:28|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  I think our perigee was about 8 miles right over the landing site, and a couple of times we had the windows (facing) down, so we could see it.  In that low sun angle, early on, before we landed, it gave you real distinct shadows.  It was good.
148:33:28||alsj|The Descent Orbit Insertion was performed at 78 hours 33 minutes.  Lunar Module separation came after a sleep period at 96 hours and then, because of concerns about the Command Module, the descent didn't start until 104 hours 17 minutes.  As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp006.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, the Sun rose at the landing site at about 78 hours.]</i></blockquote>

148:36:59||alsj|By now, Houston has noticed that the LM bearing and range aren't changing.
148:37:05||alsj|Although most aspects of the Nav system aren't working,  John hasn't made any big excursions east or west since leaving Station 8 and, consequently, the true bearing to the spacecraft hasn't changed appreciably.  Unlike the bearing and range indicators, the heading indicator is working and, so, by driving on a heading of 007, John is still pointed more or less at the LM.]</i></blockquote>

148:38:49||alsj|The 2.6-km trip from Station 9 to the LM takes a total of about 24 minutes and John's average speed for the trip is about 110 meters per minute or 6.5 km per hour  the slow average speed is probably due, in part, to sightseeing and picture taken and, partly due to the rolling terrain.  They have been driving for about 9.5 minutes and, if their average speed has been 6.5 km/hr, they may be about 1.0 km north of Station 9.  If so, they are entering the depression just north of Sunset Crater and, as can be seen in both Figure 5 in the Traverse Planning chapter of the Professional Paper and Figure 1 of the Stone Mountain chapter, this depression is about 350 meters across.]</i></blockquote>
148:39:26||alsj|Although I have not found any feature named &quot;Big Sag&quot; on the Apollo 16 maps available to me, Charlie's use of the word &quot;oblong&quot; suggests the elongated feature oriented NW-SE just above the &quot;R&quot; in &quot;North Ray&quot; in Figure 2 in the Traverse Planning chapter of the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>
148:41:09||alsj|Charlie has just invented the procedure known as an LRV pan, which he and John and, later, the Apollo 17 crew will use to good advantage.

148:43:22|Jones|alsj|I hadn't ever noticed that statement of John's before.  Could actually feel the...&quot;]
148:43:22|Duke|alsj|I think what you felt was the vibration, the hum of the electric motors and the wheels turning, and the bearings.  And that electrical motor vibration fed into the seat; and I think what you felt was that vibration, which translated into a sound.  A low pitched sound.  A little rumble.  It (meaning the seat vibration) translated into the suit and, then, the atmosphere in the suit gave you a sound.&quot;]
148:43:22|Jones|alsj|I don't know if we've talked about walkback in the case of a Rover breakdown.  Was there much detailed planning for that?&quot;]
148:43:22|Duke|alsj|The only thing I can remember is, based on our terrain, they wanted to limit us to maybe 6 (or) 7 kilometers.&quot;]
148:43:22|Jones|alsj|Out and back?  Or one-way?
148:43:22|Duke|alsj|One-way.  If the Rover didn't work at all and all we could carry is what we could get in our hands - that's why we had the little tool carrier - I think we were limited to about a kilometer.  We had some contingencies.&quot;]
148:43:22||alsj|Generally, walk-back constraints for the Rover missions were built on the assumption that, over distances of less than one kilometer, the crew could maintain an average speed of 3.6 km/hr while, on longer trips, the average speed would be 2.7 km/hr.]
148:43:22||alsj|After some searching, Charlie found maps for the planned walking traverses.]
148:43:22|Jones|alsj|On EVA-1, they had you going out to Buster.
148:43:22|Duke|alsj|Yeah, we went out to Buster, which was...This is 200 meters. (Counting) So it's about 800 meters.  And then this one (EVA-3, to the north), they were going to have us go out (counting) two kilometers...&quot;]
148:43:22|Jones|alsj|Out to End Crater.
148:43:22|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And, down south, was going to be quite a walk.  I don't think we ever would have made it down here. But (counting) it was about 3 kilometers.&quot;]
148:43:22|Jones|alsj|They got you going down as far as BL/81.5.  down about as far south as Wreck.  So, basically, on the first one they had you go to Buster and then, on the second one, to the foot of Stone Mountain and then going up and looking at Palmetto on the third one.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

148:44:48||alsj|As indicated in Figure  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1-22</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>, Bus Baker supplies power from Battery 1 and Bus Delta supplies power from Battery 2.  Charlie suspects that the switch changes they made at Stations 8 and 9 may have caused the problem.  He is probably on the right track.  The following discussion is taken from the Apollo 16 Mission Report.  Unfortunately, this is one of the poorest analyses to be found in any of the Apollo Mission Reports.]
148:44:48|Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|After leaving Station 9 during the second EVA, the crew reported that the computed parameters of bearing, distance, and range were not being updated by the Navigation system.  The heading and speed indicators, however, were operating normally.  In reviewing the navigation data reported at Stations 8 and 9, the distance and bearing data are incompatible with the time and direction of travel, respectively, from Station 8 to Station 9.  The readouts (at Station 9) had the bearing and distance indicating a northeasterly direction (of travel from Station 8), although the crew reported  that travel was in a northerly and northwesterly direction.  This indicates the Navigation system also failed to operate properly between Stations 8 and 9.&quot;]
148:44:48||alsj|&quot;At Station 8, after the navigation readouts, the vehicle was moved while attempting to determine the cause of the rear-drive loss between Stations 6 and 8.  Several switch configurations were attempted, which (probably) accounts for the subsequent incompatible navigation readouts at Station 9.&quot;]
148:44:48||alsj|The next paragraph explains why the heading and speed indicators worked properly.]
148:44:48|Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|The Navigation system is functional with the Bus B (Battery 1), Bus D (Battery 2), and Navigation circuit breakers closed.  In this configuration, the gyro operates and the heading is displayed.  In addition, with the right-rear motor-drive-power switch to either Bus B or Bus D, the speed indicator will register.  In order to compute and display distance, bearing, and range data, and to update these data, at least three of the four motor-drive-power switches must be positioned to an active bus.&quot;]
148:44:48||alsj|The next paragraph discusses possible reasons why the Nav system stopped updating on the drive from Station 9 to Station 10.]
148:44:48|Apollo 16 Mission Report|alsj|The crew reported that the Navigation system was not updating bearing, range, and distance.  This condition will occur with the loss of power to two drive motors.  From the battery and motor temperature data in Figure 14-80, the Battery 1 temperature shows an increase while the Battery 2  temperature did not rise, indicating little or no load on Battery 2 (a fact which is not surprising given that all of the motors were switched to Battery 1 before leaving Station 9).  Also, the rear-motor temperature shows an increase while the forward motor remains constant.  Thus, the Navigation (system) had no inputs from the forward wheels and could not update.&quot;]
148:44:48||alsj|The observation about the forward motors seems to be the relevant one, although one would expect that John would have made a comment if he'd thought he didn't have forward drive power.]
148:44:48||alsj|&quot;At Station 10, the digital displays and internal registers were reset to zero and the circuit breakers and switched were returned to the normal configuration.  The Navigation system then performed normally throughout the third extravehicular activity.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
148:45:37||alsj|John may have turned to the east at this point, as shown in Charlie's photo AS16-115- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18526" target="new" target="alsj">18526</a>.

148:46:10|Duke|alsj|When a mole crawls under your yard, he makes a mound (as he tunnels).  Then, once he leaves and it rains real hard, that soil continues to go down and it fills that burrow that he's dug out - that tunnel - and it just sags in from the top.

148:47:33||alsj|The second Apollo 15 EVA lasted 7 hours 12 minutes 14 seconds and was far longer than any of the EVAs conducted by prior crews.  The first Apollo 16 EVA was just slightly shorter at 7 hours 11 minutes 2 seconds.

148:47:39||alsj|Prior to Apollo 16, heart-rate data recorded during the rest periods indicated that no one had gotten more than 5 to 6 hours of sound sleep.  According to the Apollo 16 Mission Report, &quot;this was the first mission in which the lunar module crewmen obtained an adequate amount of good sleep while on the lunar surface.  The estimates of sleep duration made by ground personnel were in general agreement with the crew's subjective evaluations.&quot;  John slept soundly during all three rest periods. &quot;Typically, the Commander's sleep was uninterrupted for 4 to 5 hours, after which he would awaken, get a drink of water, and return to sleep for the rest of the night.&quot;
148:47:57||alsj|Primary crater is dug by an object coming in from space.  The typical impact velocity is 20 km/sec and the resulting crater is usually symmetrical.  A secondary crater is caused by the impact of a piece of ejecta from another lunar impact.  The impact velocity is necessarily less than the lunar escape speed of 2.4 km/s.  Secondary craters are often oblong in shape and, if the impact velocity is low enough, pieces of the impacting object will be evident in the crater or its immediate vicinity.]
148:47:57|Jones|alsj|Was it easy to distinguish primary craters from secondary craters. &quot;]
148:47:57|Duke|alsj|No, it wasn't.
148:47:57|Jones|alsj|South Ray was quite recent...
148:47:57|Duke|alsj|They felt it was quite recent because it was white, and North Ray the same way.  Recent (primary) craters had the distinct rim, whiter albedo and angular blocks.  The older ones were the more subdued (with) the rounded rims, lack of distinct blocks, and a very dark albedo. I think that's how they judged, looking at the photographs that we had. Whether that was accurate or not, I don't know.&quot;]
148:47:57|Jones|alsj|And, as you were driving around...
148:47:57|Duke|alsj|It was very difficult.  Especially...Well, I mean, like the old ones, the old, sagged areas - we called 'em sags - those were probably old craters because the rims were just gone and there was no big, real angular blocks.  This one was sort of hard to tell whether it could have been a secondary (that) a big block pounded or whether it was a primary where a big meteorite hit and then blasted out the rocks from the basement onto the side.  Now, that's what North Ray was (namely, a big primary).  Now, if this one was a primary, it wasn't a recent one, because the albedo was darker.  Now, North Ray, we knew that was a primary.  This one is a smaller one - 50 meters - and whether it was a primary or a secondary it was tough to tell.&quot;]
148:47:57|Jones|alsj|Because you did have a lot of secondaries around, from South Ray.&quot;]
148:47:57|Duke|alsj|And North Ray, probably.
148:47:57|Jones|alsj|The 17 guys, as they were driving along, kept seeing what they described as little, glass-lined, pit-bottomed craters...&quot;]
148:47:57|Duke|alsj|We saw some of that.  The real small ones were that way.&quot;]
148:47:57|Jones|alsj|A meter or so across.
148:47:57|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
148:47:57|Jones|alsj|Real fresh with some glass in the bottom.
148:47:57|Duke|alsj|A little crater and it would look like a glass blower had poured out liquid glass and it just puddled in the bottom.  We saw some of that.  We saw some of that glass dripped - like sauce on a sundae - just over the rock.  We saw quite a bit of that.&quot;]
148:47:57||alsj|Most of these are probably primary craters created by very high-velocity impacts, rather than secondaries dug by pieces of ejecta coated with still-molten glass.
148:47:57||alsj|The fact that Charlie describes this crater as being radial symmetric and relatively deep suggests to me that it is a primary, albeit one old enough that the soil ejecta has been darkened by the steady rain of very small impactors.]
148:47:57||alsj|In 3.5 minutes, John will report that they are about 200 meters from the LM.  Assuming an average speed of 9 km/hr, we can estimate that this steep-side, 50-m-diameter crater is about 700 to 750 meters south of the LM.  An examination of Figure 3 in the Central Region chapter of the Professional Paper shows a deep, 40-m crater 680 meters from the LM on a south southwesterly azimuth (north = 0) of 192.]</i></blockquote>
148:49:42||alsj|John really wants the EVA record and is suggesting that they'll have to stay out so long dusting each other that they'll get it.]</i></blockquote>
148:49:47||alsj|As Charlie indicated at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1484530" target="new" target="alsj">148:45:30</a>, he is estimating their position by sighting on some blocks on Smoky Mountain.]</i></blockquote>
148:51:15||alsj|The PLSSs each contain two feedwater containers and Charlie's main tank is just about empty.]</i></blockquote>
148:51:19||alsj|Charlie's feedwater tone can be heard in Houston.]</i></blockquote>
148:51:59||alsj|As can be seen in AS16- 115- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18547" target="new" target="alsj">18547</a>, John is aimed right at the LM, a testament to the value of using horizon features to steer by.]

148:52:43||alsj|Charlie was asking John to turn a little to the right so he could take AS16-115-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18551" target="new" target="alsj">18551</a>.] </i></blockquote>
148:53:06||alsj|As indicated on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-18.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-18</a>, they are planning to do Station 10 midway between the ALSEP site and the LM.  John turns toward the ALSEP and Charlie takes AS16-115- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18552" target="new" target="alsj">18552</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18553" target="new" target="alsj">18553</a>.  Frame 18554 is blank.  As is shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-19.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-19</a>, Charlie had planned to drill the deep core east of the Central Station but, as is shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, he actually drilled it on the south side.]</i></blockquote>
148:53:25||alsj|When Charlie's main feedwater supply went dry, he began to lose the ice layer in the sublimator in his PLSS and, consequently, the feedwater pressure began to drop.  Once he switched to the Aux tank, the ice layer began to build up again and the resistance it provided led to an increase in the feedwater pressure.]</i></blockquote>
148:53:28||alsj|As is shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the Preliminary Science Report, the Mortar Package is the ALSEP component closest to the LM.]</i></blockquote>

148:54:11||alsj|Charlie is saying that the main benefit of having a working Nav system is that it lets Houston know where they are at any
148:54:15||alsj|Note that John's checklist is on his left arm and, to turn the page, he would have to take his right hand off the handcontroller. Rather than do that, he simply asks Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
148:54:32|Jones|alsj|What does John mean by 'that saved us a lot of time'?&quot;]
148:54:32|Duke|alsj|Well, if the LM was on a slope, we'd have had a very difficult time working.  If you were coming straight down at a slow rate of descent, it could land on a 14-degree slope and stay upright; but that would have been a bitch to work on.&quot;]
148:54:32|Jones|alsj|Getting the equipment out...
148:54:32|Duke|alsj|You know, if it's pitched up on a slope (perhaps because the aft footpad is in a crater), you could have been alright in the front but, around to the back, I would probably not have been able to reach the Experiments packages.  And it really would have complicated our setup of the Rover.  So that's what he was talking about.&quot;]
148:54:32|Jones|alsj|Would it have complicated life in the spacecraft, too?&quot;]
148:54:32|Duke|alsj|Well, I think we could have been alright.  John could have slept with his head up (at the forward end of the cabin), and I could have rolled around against the bench back there.  I'd have been alright.&quot;]
148:54:32|Jones|alsj|But if you had to lean one way or the other in the suit...&quot;]
148:54:32|Duke|alsj|It wouldn't have mattered.  No, you could have worked okay.&quot;]
148:54:32||alsj|John has come to a stop with the Rover pointing south.]</i></blockquote>
148:56:59||alsj|Pause
||alsj|The planned Station 10 activities are shown on cuff checklist pages <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-18.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-18</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-19.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-19</a>.  Charlie will start with a double core.  John's trenching task has been dropped.
148:57:18||alsj|TV on.
148:57:18||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, John has parked about 60 meters from the LM.  When the TV comes on, the spacecraft is at the left side of the picture.  For reference, at 60 meters the 7-meter-tall LM subtends 6.7 degrees.]</i></blockquote>
148:58:10||alsj|The TV image moves up and down as John dusts.  He then swings the TV around to the right and dusts the lens with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">big dustbrush</a>.  Once John finishes, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pans left, probably to get to the counter-clockwise stop so he can start a full pan.
148:58:26||alsj|Fendell reaches the CCW limit and promptly starts a clockwise pan.
148:59:05||alsj|In Houston, TELMU informs Flight that the current record for an EVA is 7 hours 12 minutes.  Clearly, Houston understands the crew's interest in staying out a little longer.
148:59:14||alsj|John crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left, headed for the back of the Rover.
148:59:14||alsj|John has just noticed that his SCB had fallen off his PLSS sometime during the drive from Station 9 but ended up wedged on the inside of the left-rear fender.
148:59:55||alsj|In Houston, Flight has been talking to the Surgeon about a 10-minute extension.  The Surgeon says that his only concern is that it not shorten the sleep period.
149:00:26||alsj|After scanning across the South Ray ejecta blanket.  Fendell is not looking at the ALSEP array.  Charlie crosses the field-of-view from right to left carrying the double core.  As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, he will take the double core 10 meters south of the Rover at the spot marked &quot;DT (Drive Tube) 60010/60009.&quot;
149:00:32||alsj|John's Station 10 tasks were the trenching and a pan.]</i></blockquote>
149:00:39||alsj|John may have decided to start with the pan or, possibly, to do some sampling.
149:00:49||alsj|Charlie is concerned that the number of rocks on the surface indicates a high probability of running into subsurface rocks with the core tube.
149:01:02||alsj|John is saying that he hadn't done much, if any, training with the penetrometer but had done some coring.
149:01:10||alsj|Charlie has probably backed up to take a cross-Sun &quot;before&quot;.
149:01:23|Duke|alsj|The red dot is something to do with the winding mechanism.  When it was winding, if I remember, there was a red dot (showing).  And if that stayed there, it hadn't wound all the way, and so it wouldn't work.  But you could manually wind it to the next frame, and that would generally reset the thing and then you could pull the trigger and then it would work.  But you couldn't do it yourself.  So the other fellow had to wind it for you.  And it was like a manual wind on the top of the electric one.
149:01:23|Jones|alsj|On the film cassette.
149:01:23|Duke|alsj|I think.  I don't really remember where it was, but I think it was.&quot;]
149:01:23||alsj|Journal Contributor Markus Mehring suggests that the &quot;red dot  is a readout on the right side of each magazine, right between the top reel and the bottom indicator for 'frames shot/remaining'. It must be hard - if not impossible - to observe if the camera is attached to the RCU, unless you use the wrist-mirror.  See a discussion of the wrist mirrors following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.eva3prep.html#1631953" target="new" target="alsj">163:19:53</a> in the A17LSJ.  Parenthetically, I wonder if the astronauts could feel the vibrations of the motor through their suit, validating proper film transport?. With regard to the manual film transport Charlie describes, I have absolutely no idea of how that would have been accomplished, and why an astronaut couldn't have done that himself. There's no mechanism for manual film transport on this generation of Hasselblads, so this might have been an improvised workaround, maybe by pressing your finger(s) or thumb flat onto the reel attachment and then turning it. That would indeed be quite difficult with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a> on in a pressurized suit, and you'd possibly need a helping hand, especially if the camera is still attached to the RCU.&quot;
149:01:23||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise stop and is looking north, over the back of the Rover.  John and Charlie are both at the core tube site.]</i></blockquote>
149:01:46||alsj|After John advanced the film - which caused frame AS16-115-18554 to be blank - Charlie took two test pictures, AS16-115- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18555" target="new" target="alsj">18555</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18556" target="new" target="alsj">18556</a>.  In <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18555" target="new" target="alsj">18555</a>, note that the rock that is just right and below center, with a smaller rock in front of it, is at the upper left in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18557" target="new" target="alsj">18557</a>, which is the cross-Sun.]
149:01:46||alsj|Fendell starts panning left.
149:01:50||alsj|Charlie takes a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-115- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18557" target="new" target="alsj">18557</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18558" target="new" target="alsj">18558</a>.  In <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18557" target="new" target="alsj">18557</a>, we see that he has pushed the first section of the core in about 2/3rds of the way by hand.  The rock at the upper left may be the one below center and to the right in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18555" target="new" target="alsj">18555</a>.  John is in the background.]</i></blockquote>
149:02:03||alsj|My thanks to Ken Glover for sorting out Charlie's meaning.  A comma after 'with' and an apostrophe in 'it's' makes all the difference.
149:02:17||alsj|Charlie crosses the field-of-view from left to right.  He is going to get the penetrometer, which is mounted on the back of the Rover.
149:02:17||alsj|The &quot;top of the bottom one&quot; is the top end closure of the bottom core tube as shown at the left in  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 15</a> in Judy Allton's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/Welcome.html" target="new" target="alsj">Tool Book</a>.  Had this lower section been used by itself, Charlie would have left the top end closure on the tube so he could fit it into the extension handle.]</i></blockquote>
149:02:20||alsj|Charlie is asking Tony which of the cone-shaped tips he should use on the penetrometer.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-1</a> in the Preliminary Science Report and the Station 4 discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta4.html#1442438" target="new" target="alsj">144:24:38</a>.]</i></blockquote>
149:02:44||alsj|Fendell finds John south of the Rover, where he is hammering on the double core.  Stone Mountain is behind him and the South Ray ejecta blanket is visible on the right edge of the picture.  John stops hammering for a moment and re-adjusts his grip.  He then resumes hammering.  We can see that there is no SCB on the left side of his PLSS and that an attachment strap is hanging down.  NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s72_33898.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-33898</a> shows Charlie driving a double core during training at the Kennedy Space Center on 22 March 1972.]</i></blockquote>
149:02:49||alsj|John delivers five more blows and then stops to re-adjust his grip.
149:02:54||alsj|While talking to Tony, John delivered three more blows and then stopped and transferred the hammer to his left hand.
149:03:05||alsj|John delivers three left-handed blows.
149:03:15||alsj|John transfers the hammer back to his right hand and positions the head so he can hit the extension handle with the head rather than the flat.  The surface area of the head is only about a quarter of the area of the flat.  See <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy34.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 34</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Book.  For scale, the total length of the hammer is 39 cm.  The extension handle is shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 29</a>.  For scale, the extension handle is 76 cm long and the T handle is 15.5 cm long.]
149:03:15||alsj|John delivers five accurate blows and then stops to rest.  A comparison with video of Charlie and others using the flat of the hammer to drive core tubes into the ground is another indication of John's incredible ability to work effectively in the suit.]</i></blockquote>
149:03:23||alsj|John resumes hammering, righthanded, with the head.
149:03:23||alsj|After delivering eight more blows, John stops briefly and then, on the next blow, loses his grip on the down stroke.  The hammer hits the ground at his feet with considerable force.
149:03:41||alsj|The hammer bounces and almost ends up upright with the handle sticking up in easy reach.  John tries to get it to stop rotating - with his &quot;Whoa!&quot; - but, after a tantalizing moment of hesitation, it finally falls.
149:03:42||alsj|John circles the hammer and gets into position east of it so he can bob down to his right knee and grab it.  He does so with ease and, as he rises, he takes a couple of small steps forward to get his feet under his center of gravity.  This is a classic piece of John Young in action.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new" target="alsj">119:24:37</a>.]</i></blockquote>
149:03:59||alsj|John has resumed his hammering, righthanded, and delivers nine blows before stopping for a bit of rest.  This series is not as accurate as the ones he struck before dropping the hammer.
149:04:12||alsj|John switches the hammer to his left hand and delivers two blows with the flat before he stops and  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">reaches back with his right hand to increase the flow rate of cooling feedwater</a>.
149:04:12||alsj|Charlie seems to be having some kind of trouble with the penetrometer but made no comment about it in the post-mission Technical Debrief or in the Mission Report.
149:04:23||alsj|John delivers six more left-handed blows with the flat and then stops briefly.
149:04:26||alsj|John resumes hammering.
149:04:32||alsj|John stops and steps back.
149:04:42||alsj|John grabs the extension handle with his right hand and starts to pull up.  The core resists him and he steps in until he is almost straddling it.  He jerks the core tube upward a couple of times, leaning to his left to compensate for the fact that the extension handle is higher off the ground after each pull.  In a final effort, he pulls the core loose and, in the process, actually leaves the ground.]</i></blockquote>
149:04:51||alsj|As the core comes out of the ground, a noticeable amount of dirt falls to the surface but, as John reports at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1490627" target="new" target="alsj">149:06:27</a>, none of that dirt is actually coming out of the core but, rather, is material that came out on the outside of the tube because of friction.]
149:04:51||alsj|John rests the bit end on the surface.  The top of the extension handle is at about eye level.  The total length is a bit less than the 160 cm sum of the 76 cm of the extension handle plus 42 cm apiece for the core tubes.]</i></blockquote>
149:05:00||alsj|John backs up to take an &quot;after&quot; of the hole from the south.]</i></blockquote>
149:05:35||alsj|John inverts the double core while Fendell zooms in on the core hole.  John is using magazine 114 and, apparently, doesn't actually take a picture of the hole.  He starts running toward the Rover and goes out of view to the right.]</i></blockquote>
149:05:36||alsj|Charlie crosses the field-of-view from right to left, carrying the penetrometer, and John follows.]</i></blockquote>
149:06:09||alsj|Charlie has his back to us but he is clearly adjusting the recording drum.]</i></blockquote>
149:06:18||alsj|Charlie positions the penetrometer about two meters east of the double-core hole.
149:06:48||alsj|Charlie positions his left hand on the top of the penetrometer and then covers that hand with his right.  He then pushes firmly on the penetrometer six times and gets a total penetration of perhaps 30 to 40 cm.]
149:06:48|Duke|alsj|I had to really push.  It didn't go real steady.  It's supposed to be a real steady push on that penetrometer; but you can see I pushed on it two or three times.&quot;]
149:06:48|Jones|alsj|It's tall enough that you couldn't really lean on it.&quot;]
149:06:48|Duke|alsj|Well, that's what I was trying to do.  You see?  There's a push.  There's another push.  I was trying to get on top of it.  And then another push.  Another one.
149:06:48|Jones|alsj|So this is mostly arm force, rather than body weight.&quot;]
149:06:48||alsj|In Octobert 2012, Journal Contributor Keith Hearn called attention to <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunar_data/soil_mech_browse.html" target="new" target="alsj">digitized records</a> from the penetrometers used on Apollos 15 and 16 are now available on the National Space Science Data Center website.  The <a href="A16A_SMSS_72_M016936_008.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">data recorded here at Station 10</a> shows that Charlie did, indeed, push on the penetrometer six times. &quot;The X (horizontal) dimension is the stress applied, and Y is the depth. Starting from the top, you can see that he pushed it down to around 7.2cm, then let up the force, resulting in the horizontal line there, then pushed down to 10.3cm and let up, and so on. And sure enough, the data shows that he did six pushes&quot;  The final depth he reached was about 22 cm.</i></blockquote>
149:07:08||alsj|Charlie pushes on the penetrometer one last time.]</i></blockquote>
149:07:19||alsj|Charlie heads for the back of the Rover, using his skipping stride as he goes out of view to the right.]</i></blockquote>
149:07:33||alsj|Fendell pans right.  Tony is leaving open the possibility that a penetrometer measurement might be added to EVA-3.  Charlie wants to see how far he can throw a small object like the tip and Tony is suggesting that he shouldn't throw it just yet.]</i></blockquote>
149:07:49||alsj|The rammer-jammer is a thin rod, shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy18.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 18</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Book.  John inserted the rammer-jammer into a hole in the fitting on the top of the double core and pushed a sliding &quot;keeper&quot; firmly onto the top of the soil column.  Recall that John has already put a cap on the open end of the bottom section.]</i></blockquote>
149:07:50||alsj|The keeper has to go all the way into the core tube so John can remove the top end closure and install a cap.  The top end closure is shown in  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 15</a> in the Tool Book while the Apollo 16/17 caps are shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy17.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 17</a>.]</i></blockquote>
149:07:52||alsj|John drove the core tube a little too deeply.]</i></blockquote>
149:08:09||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the drill and the drill-stem rack and, then, without pulling back on the zoom, pans right.
149:08:17||alsj|Charlie crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left to do a penetrometer measurement with the 0.2 tip.]
149:08:17||alsj|With the keeper in the upper section rammed into position, John has now disassembled the double core by unscrewing the two sections.]</i></blockquote>
149:08:23||alsj|John is asking Charlie where he put the top end closure of the lower core-tube section when he assembled the double core at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1485807" target="new" target="alsj">148:58:07</a>.]</i></blockquote>
149:08:26||alsj|As can be seen in AS16-107- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17446" target="new" target="alsj">17446</a>, the LPM is at the back of the Rover on the top right corner of the tool pallet.  The Lunar Surface Magnetometer (LSM) is the large instrument they deployed at the ALSEP site.]
149:08:26||alsj|Fendell stops his pan, pulls back on the zoom, and pans left to find Charlie.  However, before he finds him, the ALSEP experimenters ask if he can give them a close-up of the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE) and, when Flight agrees to the request, Fendell stops and pans right.] </i></blockquote>
149:09:00||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the Central Station and then, after a prompt from Flight, moves his aim slightly to the left to pick up the PSE. The RTG is to the right of the Central Station.  Charlie crosses the field-of-view from left to right so he can help John.]</i></blockquote>
149:09:21||alsj|Charlie crosses-the field-of-view from right to left, headed back to do the penetrometer measurement.]</i></blockquote>
149:09:25||alsj|After a few seconds, during which time someone on the Experiments team has probably taken a picture off the TV monitor - Fendell pulls back on the zoom and pans left to find Charlie.
149:09:46||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie near the spot where he did the first penetrometer test.  He is leaning forward on the penetrometer, giving it a push every second or so.  As it goes farther into the ground, he moves his feet farther back so that he can continue to put his full weight on the instrument.  He weighs about 30 pounds and his suit and backpack, combined, weigh another 30 pounds.]</i></blockquote>
149:09:57||alsj|John is asking where he should stow the core sections.]</i></blockquote>
149:10:01||alsj|After getting the penetrometer almost all the way into the ground, Charlie stands.]</i></blockquote>
149:10:18||alsj|Charlie leans to his left and slowly pulls the penetrometer out of the ground.  He slides the plate to the end of the rod.]</i></blockquote>
149:10:30||alsj|Charlie hops sideways toward the drill holes.]</i></blockquote>
149:10:34||alsj|Charlie positions the penetrometer, puts both hands on the top and, with the first push, gets it more than a half meter.  The approximate locations of his penetrometer tests are shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> and are labeled &quot;Pen 1&quot;, &quot;Pen 2&quot;, and so on.]</i></blockquote>
149:11:05||alsj|Charlie pushes three more times, making some progress with the first two, and then stands.]</i></blockquote>
149:11:10||alsj|Charlie pulls the penetrometer out of the ground.]</i></blockquote>
149:11:14||alsj|After advancing the recording drum, Charlie moves toward a point midway between the Rover and the deep core site.  He uses his skipping stride.  Fendell follows.  After running about 10 meters, he stops, checks his location and then positions the penetrometer on the surface.]</i></blockquote>
149:11:46||alsj|Charlie puts his weight on the penetrometer, which slides all the way into the ground.  As it gets near full depth, Charlie loses his balance and starts rotating slowly to his right.
149:11:53||alsj|Charlie catches himself with his right hand and, with his weight supported, kicks his feet around to his right to stop his rotation.]</i></blockquote>
149:11:59||alsj|Charlie sounds quite relaxed.  He gets into a push-up position, with his weight on his hands and toes and his knees slightly off the ground.  He pushes back but, with his knees elevated, doesn't get much rotation at the waist and, consequently, doesn't get his center-of-gravity behind his knees.  His rotation stops and he falls back onto his hands. Once his hands are on the ground, he lets himself rotate forward until his feet are off the ground.  He then kicks his feet up, as they fall, he pushes up with his hands.  His chest rises a meter or so off the ground and, at that point, he tries to run forward to catch himself.  He doesn't make it and falls forward.  As his hands touch the ground again, he lets himself rotate all the way down and then pushes back, hard, and jerks his legs forward as his head and shoulders rotate up.  This maneuver gets his knees under his center-of-gravity and, finally, he is able to jump to his feet.  The entire sequence, from his first push back to the time he is on his feet takes just under 10 seconds.  He hops back until he can see the penetrometer.]
149:11:59||alsj|Note that Charlie has not been wearing a camera while taking the penetrometer measurements.]
149:11:59|Duke|alsj|You couldn't push on the penetrometer with the camera on.  It was impossible.  So I took the camera off; and that's why I was able to get up.  With the camera on, I probably wouldn't have been able to get up - without getting on a slope or without John helping.
149:12:43||alsj|Charlie pulls the penetrometer out of the ground, slides the plate to the end of the rod, and adjusts the recording drum.]</i></blockquote>
149:12:52||alsj|Charlie is running toward the deep core site, sometimes loping and sometimes skipping.  The choice of stride may depend on local variations in slope.  He stops a couple of meters south of the drill.
149:13:23||alsj|Tony made this call on his own.  As he speaks, Lovell says that Charlie's first spot was okay.  Charlie hops forward during his next transmission.
149:13:32||alsj|Charlie may have moved 3 or 4 meters.  He is now north of the drill and positions the penetrometer.  As he pushes on it, it begins to slide into the ground, albeit not as quickly as at the previous spot.
149:13:48||alsj|Charlie may be using less force as he feels the penetrometer slide into the ground, trying not to fall forward this time.]</i></blockquote>
149:13:51||alsj|Charlie winds up on his knees, with his PLSS far enough back that his center-of gravity is over his knees.  From that position, he should be able to lean back slightly and then stand.  However, Charlie has not become proficient at this maneuver.
149:13:56||alsj|Charlie leans back until the bottom of his PLSS is touching his heels.  He is unsure he'll be able to get up from that position but, after a few seconds, decides to give it a try.  He uses his leg muscles to push his torso up and as he rises, kicks his feet forward under his body.  On Earth, the maneuver would be very difficult.  On the Moon, it is relatively easy and was used on numerous occasions by the Apollo 17 crew.
149:14:01||alsj|Charlie heads for the Rover, passing one of the abandoned heat flow holes on the way.
149:14:13||alsj|Charlie stops, turns to his left, and runs toward the Central Station.  Fendell follows, but overshoots.
149:14:24||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-1</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, Charlie will attach a 2.54 by 12.7 cm flat plate to the tip of the penetrometer.  The plate will not penetrate very far into the soil but will provide independent estimates of the bearing strength and compressibility of the surface layers.
149:14:40||alsj|Fendell pans left to find Charlie, but overshoots again. Charlie is standing on the south side of the Central Station and is looking at the heat flow connector.]</i></blockquote>
149:14:55||alsj|Figure 14-51 shows the configuration of the cable break Charlie is describing.  See, also, the discussion following the accident at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.heatflow.html#1212137" target="new" target="alsj">121:21:37</a>.]
149:14:55||alsj|Fendell pans right but, just as the Central Station comes into view, Charlie goes off-screen to the left, headed for the double core site immediately south of the Rover.  Fendell gives up trying to follow Charlie and pans right.]</i></blockquote>
149:15:07||alsj|Charlie crosses the field-of-view from left to right.  He is back at the Rover and is going to the back of the vehicle to store the penetrometer.  Fendell stops his pan to examine the large boulder north of the ALSEP site and about 30 meters west of the present Rover position.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  Fendell pans right.]
149:15:07||alsj|John has been looking for a sample of vesicular basalt, a rock type that would indicate the presence of lava flows in the area as some of the geologists had expected.  Vesicles are the imprints of gas bubbles that form near the surface of a cooling lava flow.]</i></blockquote>
149:16:08||alsj|John may have been trying to recall the expression, &quot;How come there's never a policeman around when you need one?&quot;]</i></blockquote>
149:16:22||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the back of the Rover adjusting the penetrometer.  Just as Fendell stops, Charlie goes out of view to the left, headed for the double-core site south of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
149:16:50||alsj|Fendell pans left.  Off-camera, Charlie is looking for the double-core hole.
149:17:37||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie just as he starts to run back to the Rover.  About halfway back, Charlie stops and reconfigures the penetrometer.]</i></blockquote>
149:17:42||alsj|Charlie positions the penetrometer and puts his hands on the top.  He applies steady pressure and the penetrometer sinks a few centimeters into the surface.  He gives a second push and gets only another cm or two.  A final push causes the rod to bow out ten cm or more for a fraction of a second.  When Charlie stops pushing, the rod immediately straightens.
149:18:05||alsj|Charlie pulls the penetrometer out of the ground and heads for the back of the Rover, going off-screen to the right.  Fendell pans right.
149:18:19||alsj|Charlie crosses the field-of-view from right to left, still carrying the penetrometer.  Fendell stops panning right and reverses direction to follow Charlie.  Charlie wants to get up-Sun of John so John's lens will be illuminated.
149:18:39||alsj|Off-camera, John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;before&quot; photos of a sample.  The photos are AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18445" target="new" target="alsj">18445</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18446" target="new" target="alsj">18446</a>.  He then grabs the sample with his tongs and takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18447" target="new" target="alsj">18447</a>, which shows the rock in the tongs.  The sample is 60115, a 136 gram breccia, which is shown in Figures 13A to 13D in the Documentation of Samples chapter in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>

149:19:06||alsj|Fendell finds John at the CDR seat.  The LM is in the background and Fendell zooms in on it.  At maximum zoom, the LM almost exactly fills the TV frame.
149:19:13||alsj|John is probably asking Charlie to stow the tongs on the back of the Rover.
149:19:18||alsj|Charlie had taken the rake off the extension handle so he could assemble the double core and, here, it has taken a minute for him to find it.
149:19:49||alsj|John goes off-camera to the right.  Fendell is still looking at the LM.]</i></blockquote>
149:20:30||alsj|Fendell has pulled back on the zoom and, now, the LM covers only about 20 percent of the height of the image.]</i></blockquote>
149:20:45||alsj|John has started a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1492040.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">pan</a>, which consists of frames AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18449" target="new" target="alsj">18449</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18467" target="new" target="alsj">18467</a>.]

149:20:45||alsj|As Charlie starts his run and gets up to speed, he glides across a shallow crater.]</i></blockquote>
149:20:51||alsj|Charlie is using the loping, foot-to-foot stride.]</i></blockquote>

149:21:17||alsj|Charlie reaches the MESA after a 44-second run.  The straight-line distance from the back of the Rover to the MESA is about 58 meters and his average speed is a relaxed 4.8 km/hr.  During the Apollo 17 ALSEP deployment at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.deepcore.html#1202711" target="new" target="alsj">120:27:11</a>, Jack Schmitt ran 50 meters at 5.4 km/hr, albeit on a much smoother surface.]
149:21:17||alsj|TV off.
149:22:30||alsj|At some point before John starts the drive back, Charlie takes a series of pictures of him:  AS16-115- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18559" target="new" target="alsj">18559</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18562" target="new" target="alsj">18562</a>.] </i></blockquote>  <p>&nbsp;

The Apollo 15 record was 7 hours 12 minutes.  John and Charlie will get the record if they start cabin repress after about 149:52.]</i></blockquote>
149:23:32||alsj|Although there is no mention of looking for Rover tracks on the mountain, this is probably something Charlie was curious about before the mission.  The human eye can be a lot better than the Hasselblads in picking out detail at a distance.]</i></blockquote>

149:24:08||alsj|The UV camera has been taking data from a single field-of-view - just above the summit of Stone Mountain - ever since John last reset it at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2prelim.html#1432303" target="new" target="alsj">143:23:03</a>, just before he and Charlie started the drive to Station 4.]</i></blockquote>
149:24:55||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> is looking toward the block-covered ridge SSW of the LM.  He pans clockwise.  John parked the Rover on a northeasterly heading at the MESA.  If he has followed the procedures on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR20-21.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-21</a>, his heading is 351.]</i></blockquote>
149:25:03||alsj|As shown in the camera decals in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp449.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">5.3-2</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, f/5.6 was normally used for up-Sun photos taken with either color (HCEX) or black-and-white (HBW) film.
149:25:03||alsj|Journal Contributor Markus Mehring notes &quot;'HCEX' is a cryptic acronym for </i>the<i> Apollo standard color film emulsion, used both in the Hasselblads ('HCEX') and the 16-mm Maurer cameras ('CEX'). Its full name is 'Ektachrome MS Film, Type SO 368 (19 DIN, 64 ASA)', and amateur and professional photographers worldwide know it as 'Ektachrome X' - hence the 'EX'.&quot;
149:25:03||alsj|Fendell pans past Charlie, who may be dusting the front of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
149:25:23||alsj|John takes three pictures of the UV Camera, AS16-114- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18468" target="new" target="alsj">18468</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18469" target="new" target="alsj">18469</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18470" target="new" target="alsj">18470</a>.  Neither he nor Charlie take any more pictures during this EVA.]
149:25:23||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right.
149:26:18||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie, who is visible beyond the LMP seat as he packs the rock box at the MESA.]</i></blockquote>
149:26:53||alsj|Fendell pans up to look at the Ascent Stage.  In Houston, Flight tells EVA (the person responsible for keeping track of the timeline and planned activities) that he thinks John has parked on the wrong heading.]</i></blockquote>
149:26:56||alsj|Charlie is saying that there is an unbagged rock in SCB-2 and wants to know if it should go into the rock box along with the bagged samples and core tubes.]</i></blockquote>
149:27:10||alsj|Charlie has probably put the unbagged rock aside on the MESA and now takes the empty SCB to the Rover.  He tosses it in his foot pan and reaches under his seat to get another SCB.  He pauses a moment, possibly to look at his checklist and then bangs the bag against the seat frame, possibly in an effort to get the top open.]</i></blockquote>
149:27:43||alsj|Charlie stands the SCB upright in his footpan, gets a core tube out of his seat pan and inserts it into a stowage sleeve in the SCB. During the following conversation, he reaches across the Rover and gets something - possibly a sample - out of John's seat pan.]</i></blockquote>
149:28:32||alsj|Charlie takes the SCB to the MESA.  Its top is now open.  Fendell pans right and finds John at the CDR seat.  He is working with an SCB that appears to have little, if anything, in it.
149:28:46||alsj|John turns the SCB upside down, takes the bottom in his left hand and shakes it to get something out.
149:28:59||alsj|John takes the SCB to the back of the Rover.  He then appears to attach the SCB to the tool carrier.  Fendell pans left to watch Charlie at the MESA.]</i></blockquote>
149:29:29||alsj|Charlie has removed the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy74.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Beta-cloth protector</a>, which was covering the seals on the rock box, and discards it to his left.]</i></blockquote>
149:29:30||alsj|Charlie removes the Teflon  &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy71.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">spacer</a>&quot; from the rock box and tosses it off-camera to his left.]</i></blockquote>
149:29:37||alsj|Charlie closes the top of the rock box and latches it.]</i></blockquote>
149:30:14||alsj|John goes to the LMP seat.  He doesn't appear to be carrying anything so, whatever it was he shook out of the SCB, it probably wasn't a sample.  John is probably looking in the seat pans to make sure they haven't overlooked any samples.
149:30:25||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right, probably carrying the SCB so he can pack the film magazines in it as per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-22.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-22</a>.  John goes around the back of the Rover and joins Charlie off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>
149:30:41||alsj|John is referring to the fact that his SCB fell off, probably while he climbed on the Rover at Station 9, and then wedged between the fender and the frame of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
149:30:47||alsj|John probably means that they have two unused SCBs which
149:31:26||alsj|Most of the rocks they collected went into John's SCB.
149:31:26||alsj|Fendell starts a counter-clockwise pan.  In Houston, Flight is having a discussion with Experiments, who are pointing out that, at this point, SCB-3 is supposed to be empty and under the LMP seat for use during EVA-3.  At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1493002" target="new" target="alsj">149:30:02</a>, they heard Charlie say that he was putting some full core tubes and John's crystalline rock in SCB-3 and, by inference, that he was planning to take it up to the cabin.  Tony joins the SCB discussion in Houston.]</i></blockquote>
149:32:47||alsj|Part way through his pan, Fendell raised his aim and continued turning the TV until he found the high-gain antenna on the front of the Rover.  He then raised his aim some more and is now looking at Earth.
149:33:15||alsj|Fendell has zoomed in on Earth.  At maximum zoom, the apparent diameter of Earth  - which is two degrees - is equivalent to about one third of the vertical height of the TV field-of view.  About one quarter of the Moon-facing hemisphere is sunlit.
149:33:49||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and lowers his aim.]</i></blockquote>
149:34:09||alsj|When the horizon comes into view, Fendell is looking at the Solar Wind Collector.  He pans right until he gets the U.S. flag centered. He stops for a moment and then resumes panning to the right.]</i></blockquote>
149:34:21||alsj|Although <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-21.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-21</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR20-21.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-21</a> are a bit different in detail, they both have the ETB loading procedures on the following pages, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2LMP-22.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-22</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR22-23.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-22</a>.]</i></blockquote>
149:34:29||alsj|John is just reminding Charlie that they both changed magazines during the EVA and don't want to leave any of the used magazines outside.
149:34:50||alsj|Here, Charlie is using &quot;bag&quot; to describe the stowage enclosure under his seat.  As with the SCBs, the sides and bottom of the stowage area are made of Beta cloth.
149:35:23||alsj|Fendell has stopped his pan and has zoomed in on some footprints, Rover tracks, and rocks northeast of the Rover.  After giving the people in the Backroom a few seconds to get a picture off the TV monitor, he pulls back on the zoom and pans to the right again.
149:35:49||alsj|They have probably dropped the glass ball.  Bailey and Ulrich, in &quot;Apollo 16 Voice Transcript Pertaining to the geology of the landing site&quot; identify this sample as 65016, while, in the caption to Figure 45 of the Professional Paper, sample 65016 is identified as a Station 5 sample, probably the one John examined at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta5.html#1452052" target="new" target="alsj">145:20:52</a>.  Readers should note that Bailey and Ulrich don't really make a clear decision about 65016; specifically, they identify 65016 as BOTH the 145:20:52 specimen and the glass ball the crew is collecting here at the LM.  However, in the Station 5 TV coverage, we can clearly see John drop the 145:20:52 specimen and, therefore, I am inclined to believe that 65016 is the glass ball they have just dropped.]</i></blockquote>
149:35:58||alsj|Fendell finds John at the back of the Rover.  John turns and heads for the ladder with SCB-1.  Charlie is off-camera, and is probably loading John's camera into the ETB.
149:36:46||alsj|Charlie comes into view at the LMP seat.  He grabs the DAC and rotates it on its staff so he can get at the film magazine for removal.]</i></blockquote>
149:37:07||alsj|Charlie stows the DAC magazine in the ETB while John goes off-camera to the right, headed for the front of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
149:37:17||alsj|Charlie is still working at the LMP seat, perhaps re-organizing the gear in the seat pan.]</i></blockquote>
149:37:50||alsj|John turns the camera clockwise but quickly runs into the stop.
149:37:51||alsj|John now turns the camera counter-clockwise.]</i></blockquote>
149:37:55||alsj|John turns the camera until it's pointing down-Sun, which happens to be toward the high-gain mast, and then tilts it down.]</i></blockquote>
149:38:08||alsj|We get a good view of the dust coating falling off the battery cover as John opens it.  Don McMillan has provided an animation ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../VLRV-covers.mov" target="new" target="alsj">0.8 Mb</a> ) of the battery covers on his Virtual Rover being opened.
149:38:55||alsj|In John's shadow, we see him unstow the big <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>.  A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16brush.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC71PC777" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71PC-777</a> shows the dustbrush stowed on the front of the training Rover.]</i></blockquote>
149:39:02||alsj|John now dusts the battery covers.
149:39:15||alsj|John now dusts the LCRU mirrors in the foreground of the TV picture.]
149:39:15||alsj|Charlie's next transmission indicates that he is scanning his checklist and noticed the item &quot;Large Rocks (LRV) to SCB&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
149:39:22||alsj|Big Muley ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-41550.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">175k</a> ) is the 11.7 kg breccia they collected at the rim of Plum Crater.  It has been sitting in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> (ladder) footpad since Charlie put it there at the end of EVA-1.]</i></blockquote>
149:39:43||alsj|John is now dusting just off-camera to the left.
149:39:43||alsj|Pallet 2 contains food and replacement batteries and LiOH canisters for the PLSSs.  It is stowed in the MESA.  According to the Final LM Stowage List, Apollo 16 carried a 10.5 pound (4.8 kg) 'food assembly' in  the LM ascent stage and two 4.6 pound (2.1 kg) 'food assemblies' in the descent stage.  One of the latter is in Pallet 2 and the other was in Pallet 1, which they took up to the cabin at the end of EVA-1.  See, also, the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2post.html#1534813" target="new" target="alsj">153:48:13</a>.
149:39:47||alsj|Charlie is looking for the replacement LiOH canister for the LM ECS system but doesn't see it.  What he is having trouble remembering is that, at Houston's request, he took it out of the MESA at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.clsout1.html#1252647" target="new" target="alsj">125:26:47</a> at the end of EVA-1 and he and John took it up to the cabin.  The change in procedure was caused by the landing delay.]</i></blockquote>
149:40:20|Jones|alsj|I've just been thinking about how relaxed and unhurried all of this is.&quot;]
149:40:20|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  By now, we were getting real familiar.  You know, real confident in the suits; and we were real confident with our procedures.  And, you know, we'd really worked a routine to work together; and it just made you comfortable.&quot;]
149:40:20|Jones|alsj|Had that pallet given you trouble all the way through training or...&quot;]
149:40:20|Duke|alsj|Well, when I say pallet, you know, there was an old training article that everybody used; and it was just old, and the stuff was in racks and everything got out of align and it would get twisted a little bit and you couldn't get it out and it'd stick and they did whatever they did to it - graphited it.  So it was frustrating.  So, when it worked here, it was always a miracle.  'Eureka!  It worked!'  'Cause we had a lot of trouble with the old training gear.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
149:40:38||alsj|John goes around the front side of the Rover so he can dust from the right side of the vehicle.]</i></blockquote>
149:40:48||alsj|Charlie is going over to the ladder and is kicking his boots against the ladder strut to knock some of the dirt off his legs.]</i></blockquote>
149:41:02||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp006.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, they had planned to end EVA-2 at about 131 hours, when the Sun's elevation was about 28 degrees.  Because of the landing delay and the decision to have a rest period before doing EVA-1, the Sun's elevation is currently about 38 degrees.  The LM shadow is only about 9 meters long. When they landed, the Sun's elevation was about 15 degrees and the shadow was about 26 meters long.]</i></blockquote>
149:42:21||alsj|The TV picture is no longer jiggling now that John has gone over to help Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
149:43:56||alsj|Charlie is assuring John that he won't go in the cabin until John's had a chance to brush him off.]</i></blockquote>
149:44:14||alsj|John may have been thinking that Charlie would be hooking up to the LM ECS or that he was going to hook up the clothesline-type <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-lec.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEC</a> that was flown on the missions prior to Apollo 16.  In either case, he is mistaken and this may be yet another sign of fatigue.]</i></blockquote>
149:45:08||alsj|Just prior to the second rest period, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.debrief1.html#1281833" target="new" target="alsj">128:18:33</a>, Tony told John and Charlie that they would get two extra hours - one Command Module orbit - added to the period from EVA-2 wake-up to the start of the post-EVA-2 rest period.]</i></blockquote>
149:45:58||alsj|Training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC72PC140" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-72PC-140</a> gives us a good view of the top of John's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a> and Hasselblad.
149:46:51||alsj|This sounds like something John might have said to his children when they were younger.  His kids are daughter Sandy and son Johnny who were born in 1957 and 1959, respectively.]</i></blockquote>
149:47:11||alsj|They never do stow the antennas and a portion of John's breaks off, probably while he crawls into the cabin.
149:47:13||alsj|A tapping sound is audible.
149:47:32|Duke|alsj|I was hitting on the top of his helmet, I think.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
149:48:04||alsj|John's feet come into view from the right side of the Rover.  In his shadow, we see him re-stow the dustbrush.
149:48:32||alsj|John goes around the front of the Rover and goes off-camera to the left.  He is going to turn the TV off and the controls are on the left side of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-52.jpg" title="photo" target="new" target="alsj">LCRU</a>.]</i></blockquote>
149:48:35||alsj|TV off.  Comm noise increases
149:50:32||alsj|Charlie's breathing is audible as he crawls into the cabin.]</i></blockquote>
149:52:16||alsj|John has forgotten to give Houston the readouts they requested.]</i></blockquote>
149:52:26||alsj|The following dialog indicates that, at this point, Charlie tosses something small out through the hatch.]</i></blockquote>
149:54:05||alsj|From the porch, John will use the lanyard to haul up the ETB.]
149:54:05|Duke|alsj|(I was suggesting that he) just put the SCB on top of the ETB with the handles, I believe, and it would just come on up, I think.&quot;]
149:54:05||alsj|The following dialog suggests that the next thing John does is to haul up the ETB.]</i></blockquote>
149:54:20||alsj|Apparently, John didn't detach the lanyard before passing in the ETB.]</i></blockquote>
149:55:11||alsj|John probably goes down the ladder at this point to get the SCBs.]</i></blockquote>
149:55:59||alsj|John may be adjusting the lanyard or, quite simply, he may be dawdling to make sure he and Charlie surpass the Apollo 15 EVA record.]</i></blockquote>
149:56:42||alsj|John brings up the first of the SCBs and tries to put it into the cabin far enough that Charlie can bend down and grab it.]</i></blockquote>
149:57:53||alsj|It is currently about 23:52 hours, April 22, 1972, Universal (Greenwich) Time.  The Moon is about to set at the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid tracking station</a> and, for the next eight hours or so, communications will come through the Goldstone station in California.]</i></blockquote>
149:58:16|This is a reference to Murphy's Law|alsj|If any thing can go wrong, it will.&quot; and its many corollaries.  My favorite is O'Toole's Rule: &quot;Murphy was an optimist.&quot;]
149:58:16||alsj|John has probably gone down the ladder to get the second SCB and is now passing it in.]</i></blockquote>
149:58:38||alsj|Charlie is standing on John's side of the cabin and now must close the hatch, move over to his side, and then re-open the hatch so John can get in.
149:59:48||alsj|John has remembered that, as per Surface 5-1, they have to turn off their PLSS feedwater before they close the hatch.]</i></blockquote>
150:00:39||alsj|Charlie's feedwater controls are on the lower right corner and he is turning to face aft so John can reach them.
150:01:34||alsj|They are now 7 hours 22 minutes into the EVA and, even though the EVA won't end until the cabin pressure gets to 3.5 psi, they have already broken the Apollo 15 record.
||alsj|John and Charlie are now doing the steps on Surface Checklist page 5-1 although, in fact, they are reading the Prep &amp; Post Card which has the same steps.  Because of the landing delay and the decision to do a rest period before EVA-1, they are about 18 hours behind the times listed in the checklist.  The NASa PAO commentator mentions that, although the signal is coming thru the 210-foot dish at Goldstone, it is very weak due to the fact that, in the effort to conserve on-board power, the signal is being transmitted with one of the LM omni antennas.
150:01:47||alsj|The PLSS warning system is telling them that there is no feedwater flow into the sublimator, a confirmation that the warning system is working.
150:01:55||alsj|The sound of repressurization becomes audible.
150:01:55|Jones|alsj|What did the cabin do when you repressurized it?  It was a pretty lightweight vehicle.  Did it pop and flex?
150:01:55|Duke|alsj|No, you didn't hear anything. The only thing you could tell was the gauges.  You know you could hear it - pssssss, you know the oxygen going in - and you just watched the cabin pressure gauge and it started climbing.
150:01:55|Jones|alsj|And the walls didn't do anything.
150:01:55|Duke|alsj|Well, I'm sure they did.  I mean, they popped and they got firm and there was probably some seating of the hatch, you know, and things like that.  But I don't remember any noises.  I know, when it's unpressurized, the Lunar Module was sort of like a beer can, it felt like.  But, when it got pressurized, it got very firm.  But it wasn't like a crumpled beer can that crinkled out; it just got firm.  You could hear and you could watch the pressure gauge rise, and that was about it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
150:02:49||alsj|The Public Affairs commentator announces an EVA duration of 7 hours 23 minutes 26 seconds.
150:03:40||alsj|John playfully pronounced &quot;req'd&quot; (meaning &quot;required&quot;) as &quot;rickered&quot;.
150:04:02||alsj|They will now verify that the circuit breakers shown as in white (&quot;white dots&quot;) on Surface 1-4 and 1-5 are open and the ones shown as black are closed.]</i></blockquote>
150:04:12||alsj|John is confirming that the breakers are still out of the systems that were powered down to save power because of the late landing and extended surface operations.]</i></blockquote>
150:04:28||alsj|The obvious reason is that, while they are wearing the PLSSs, they can accidentally knock some of the breakers.
150:04:43|Jones|alsj|You also had quite a bit of forearm fatigue after that first EVA.  How about here?
150:04:43|Duke|alsj|Same.  (And) my fingers were a little bit sore.  They did get sore and (I had) the forearm fatigue, just like the first EVA.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
150:07:07||alsj|They probably removed the helmets while John was joking with Tony.]</i></blockquote>
150:08:19||alsj|By putting the PLSS diverter valve in the horizontal position, they will get some oxygen flow into the suit torso once they get connected to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a>.
150:08:20||alsj|Charlie is probably trying to turn around enough that he can reach the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_isolation_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Suit Isolation Valves</a> on the front of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a> cabinet.]</i></blockquote>
150:08:30||alsj|A comparison of the procedures on Surface 5-1 with the post-EVA-3 procedures on 7-1 and with the post-jettison procedures on 7-4 does not suggest an explanation for Charlie's statement.  Evidently, they have not properly stowed their OPS oxygen hoses.  There is no discussion of the skipped step in the Technical Debrief.
150:10:03|Jones|alsj|Do you have any idea what you meant by 'Hope it's not the oxygen'?
150:10:03|Duke|alsj|Well, it could be an oxygen contamination and, when we repressurized, if it was (ECS) oxygen contamination, the odor could have been in the oxygen and not from the dust.  So we were hoping, you know, we didn't have any contaminated oxygen.
150:10:11||alsj|As per Surface 4-5, they had put the Cabin Gas Return valve into the Egress position prior to the EVA and hadn't planned to change it until they got to the last paragraph on Surface 5-4.  Houston may be trying to clean some of the dust out of the air that is producing the gunpowder smell.
150:10:33||alsj|Charlie is asking if he should change to Suit Gas Diverter Valve, too.  Prior to the EVA, they put the Suit Gas Diverter valve to Pull-Egress.  As indicated in the accompanying ECS  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../ecs.grumman_ec8.jpeg" target="new" target="alsj">schematic</a>, by opening the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Cabin Gas Return Valve</a>, Charlie was letting oxygen flow from the cabin into the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">ECS</a>.  To complete the circuit, he needed to open the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Suit Gas Diverter Valve</a> to let oxygen flow from the ECS into the Cabin.  Had he not opened it, oxygen still would have flowed into the cabin, but by going into the suits and then out the neckrings.]</i></blockquote>
150:11:08||alsj|This statement confirms that Charlie put the rock box on the Ascent Engine cover when John passed it in and hasn't yet moved it out of the way.
150:11:35||alsj|This is a reference to John's sneaking up on a boulder at Station 9 to collect a Contact Soil Sample.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta9.html#1475704" target="new" target="alsj">147:57:04</a> in the Station 9 portion of the transcript.]</i></blockquote>
150:11:37||alsj|This is a reference to one of two sampler heads John used in the experiment.]
150:11:37|Jones|alsj|It seems to me that you two had a tremendous amount of fun doing this.  And I think most of the crews did.  Neil and Buzz, maybe because of the pressure of the moment or their personalities didn't joke and laugh and marvel at it quite so much.  From my point of view, it's a little bit of a shame that that was the case on Apollo 11 because a lot of people only watched 11 and never became aware of how much fun it was.&quot;]
150:11:37|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  We just enjoyed ourselves and we wanted everybody to share in that.  And that's just the way John and I trained and our personalities were that way and we kidded back and forth a lot.  He's really a funny guy and he likes to have fun.  I mean, you first meet him and you think he's dead serious, dead pan.  When you get to know him, he's really a fun-loving guy.  He's got a great sense of humor. And I like that; so we just worked real well together.&quot;]
150:11:37|Jones|alsj|Do you look back on it as fun experience?
150:11:37|Duke|alsj|Oh, yeah.  I don't believe I could have flown with anybody that I had more fun with than John.  On the backup (crew) for 17, we would have had a great crew;  it would have been John and me and Stu Roosa.  Stu's like we are and it would have just been a ball.  We didn't ever get to fly together, but we had fun training.
150:11:51||alsj|Next, they will get hooked up to LM comm as per Surface 5-2.
150:13:05||alsj|Note, the times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.
150:14:38||alsj|At this point, NASA Public Affairs switches their audio feed to the conversation between CMP Ken Mattingly and CSM CapCom Hank Hartsfield and will tape any conversations with the LM crew.  As of November 2005, I do not have that audio.
150:14:38||alsj|Ed Mitchell, the Apollo 14 Lunar Module Pilot, takes over at CapCom.  Tony England has probably gone to the Backroom to discuss the scheduled EVA debriefing.
150:27:53||alsj|Houston has LOS from the Command Module and switches back to the LM audio, starting at 150:31:52, below.
150:31:36||alsj|This is another reference to the two hours Houston said, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.debrief1.html#1281833" target="new" target="alsj">128:18:33</a>, would be added to the timeline prior to the start of the upcoming rest period.
150:31:52||alsj|John is saying that he would prefer to use the extra two hours to go through the remaining procedures at a leisurely pace.
150:32:12||alsj|In the following transmission, Charlie reports the OPS tank pressures as per the last paragraph on Surface 5-2.
150:34:16||alsj|Note, the times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.  A change-of-shift is underway with Gene Kranz and the White Team taking over.
150:43:57|Duke|alsj|(Laughing) We used to get free tickets to the Astros.  They wouldn't be very pleased when I said 'lost'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
150:44:18||alsj|At about 150:57, PAO takes down the live feed and records LM comm for later playback.
150:58:34||alsj|Charlie's report indicates that they have completed their work on John's PLSS and are about halfway through the procedures, shown in the left-hand column of Surface 5-3, for Charlie's PLSS.
151:03:53||alsj|Charlie is probably seeing proof of the power conservation steps they have taken.
151:03:53|Jones|alsj|I can't tell from the comm here whether you're pressing or not.  Were you in a hustle-hustle mode here?
151:03:53|Duke|alsj|No.  Just relaxed.  We weren't hurrying up.  Once we got back inside, I don't believe we ever...You know, we were steady working; but we weren't hurrying.  I don't remember being rushed at all.
151:03:53|Jones|alsj|You had plenty of time to do things, but not much time for sitting around, though?
151:03:53|Duke|alsj|Well, not here.  No; we had a lot to do.  Get out of the suits and charge the PLSSs and all that stuff.  I don't think we're out of the suits, yet.  We were steady, but not rushed.
151:08:09||alsj|After weighing the sample containers, John and Charlie record the weights on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LMLS2-2.jpg" title="checklist page" target="new" target="alsj">page 2-2</a> of the LM Lunar Surface Checklist. and are now ready to read up the numbers.

151:09:01||alsj|Readers should note that Ed pronounces the rock name as &quot;Mull-y&quot;, rather than Charlie's &quot;Mule-y&quot;, a clear indication that he knows it's been named for Geology P.I. Bill Muehlberger (pronounced &quot;mull-ber-ger&quot;).  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1post.html#1271640" target="new" target="alsj">127:16:40</a>.]</i></blockquote>
151:17:38||alsj|John has started the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new" target="alsj">suit doffing procedures</a> listed in the right-hand column of Surface 5-4.  They had planned to reach this point in the checklist 1 hour 20 minutes after starting the Post-EVA System Configuration on Surface 5-1 at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1500352" target="new" target="alsj">150:03:52</a>.  They have gained about five minutes on the timeline.
151:49:55||alsj|Journal Contributor Thierry Bisiaux notes that, in the audio clip we currently have, the track jumps back at this point to just before 151:47:54, including a transmission of Ed's &quot;  Okay, belay that. It's Transmitter A, Voice, and B, Receiver.&quot;.  Because this audio was accumulated during the change-of-shift press briefing, the clip currently in the ALSJ may come from two tapes.
151:51:58|Duke|alsj|You've got your suit off and you're still in your LCG and it's got those cotton socks sewed to the bottom of it; and the socks are going to get full of dust and, the next time you go into your suit, all that dust goes in with you.  So that was a worry we had.  It turned out it wasn't a big deal; but there was a lot of dust on the floor.  So we got the feet of the LCGs covered with dust.  And our idea was - and it says bath mat here - you know, sort of a little grate you could unfold and you could stand on that and the dust would be down under.
151:51:58|Jones|alsj|Was there any way you could have cleaned up that dust?&quot;]
151:51:58|Duke|alsj|Well, we had a few towels and we could have gotten some towels wet and, you know, mopped it up.  But I don't think we did.  That would have been the only way; we didn't have a vacuum cleaner or anything.
151:51:58||alsj|Note, the times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.  The following audio was provided live to the press.
152:07:02||alsj|John and Charlie have now reached the last paragraph in the left-hand column on Surface 5-5.

Houston is currently using the 85-ft dish at Goldstone and, with the larger antenna, even with the LM transmitter operating at the lowest power level, Houston will be able to receive top-quality data and voice.

152:20:31||alsj|Charlie is saying that, when he tried to pack the entire SCB - bag, samples and all - in the SRC, he couldn't get the lid closed. So he chose to just dump the SCB contents into the rock box.]
152:20:31|Jones|alsj|Was the original thought to put the whole SCB in the rock box?&quot;]
152:20:31|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  The SCBs would go in the rock box.  You know, you'd just put it in and then close it.  But it would never close, with all that other stuff....You could never pound 'em out right when it was full and get the box to latch.  So I ended up emptying 'em in and not put the SCB in; that way, you could just shove the little individual sample bags into the corners and it would close.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
152:23:30|Jones|alsj|How was the comm quality at the LM end.
152:23:30|Duke|alsj|No problem.
152:23:30|Jones|alsj|Because they could push it through.
152:23:30|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  They could blast through the Moon, almost, with their big antennas and transmitters.&quot;]
152:23:30|Jones|alsj|I was thinking, last night, how surprising it is to me that the comm is so good when you're on the Rover, when you've basically just got that low-gain antenna, compared to the LM omni(-directional antenna).&quot;]
152:23:30|Duke|alsj|Well, the LM omni is what it is - omni.  It just transmits out.  It wasn't actually pointed at Earth.  The antenna that we had on the Rover was small, but it was directional.&quot;]
152:23:30|Jones|alsj|Four pi (steradians) on the omni versus a smaller angle on the low-gain would certainly help.&quot;]

152:58:58||alsj|Tony still thinks they want to do the next recharge one hour from now.
153:00:26||alsj|Although the comm is not good, it is not exceptionally bad and another factor may be the fact that, except for the time he spent in the Backroom, Tony has been at the CapCom console since <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2wake.html#1392252" target="new" target="alsj">139:22:52</a>.  After 13 1/2 hours he is probably tired, too.]
153:00:26|England, from a 1996 letter|alsj|I suppose that all of us were tired, but it was absolutely essential that I do all of the EVAs so that I would know what John and Charlie had seen and done.  The real challenge was to go home during the periods between EVAs rather than work with the scientists who were considering changes to the next EVA.  I did force myself to get adequate sleep and I don't remember being overly tired.  I am sure that we were all running on a lot of adrenalin.  Some of the (verbal) slips that you might be seeing may have had to do with maintaining several conversations.  Toward the end of each EVA, both the scientists and the systems people would have requests for the crew to do things.  Some items I could decide whether or not to pass up, but many needed concurrence of the Flight Director.  I would often be talking with them and then have to interrupt that conversation to respond to the crew.  I don't remember any details, but I wouldn't be surprised if I had messed up a few times in that process.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

153:44:25|Duke|alsj|No, that's just the way he talks.
153:44:25|Jones|alsj|You'd had a good night's sleep.  And it didn't sound like it had been a particularly tiring day.  Just busy.
153:44:25|Duke|alsj|No, I didn't think it was a tiring day, at all.  We're jumping out now, raring to go.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
153:48:46|Jones|alsj|What does 'used food' mean?
153:48:46|Duke|alsj|It's uneaten food.
153:48:46|Jones|alsj|It seems to me that they gave you tons of food.
153:48:46|Duke|alsj|(Chuckling)  Seemed like it.  Well, it was a standard meal, but it just seemed like it was just huge!  And I think it's probably a little bit bigger than normal because it was two meals a day.  And it was a little bit more than normal; they had one or two other things in there that you normally wouldn't have had.
153:48:46|Jones|alsj|So, is the main thing that each meal is half again as big as a normal meal?
153:48:46|Duke|alsj|Well, I don't know that it was half again.  But it just looked like a lot!  So we had to work at eating it all.&quot;]

The package in the center foreground is labeled 'Day 4, Meal A'.

153:48:46||alsj|During the Apollo 15 post-mission debriefings, Jim Irwin said, &quot;Did we mention that we ran out of food there in the LM?  We could have used a little more food.&quot;  On that mission a 7.4 pound (3.4 kg) 'food assembly' as flown in the cabin and two 4.0 pound (1.8 kg) 'food assemblies' were flown in the MESA.  The total was 15.4 pounds (7.0 kg).
153:48:46||alsj|Additional detail is provided by the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15mr.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 15 Mission Report</a>, &quot;The food system on this flight was similar to that of previous Apollo missions with the exception that additional food stowage space was provided in both the CSM and the LM to accommodate the extra food required for a 12.3-day lunar mission. Prior to flight, each crewman evaluated about 100 available foods and selected his menu. The food was arranged in meal packages for the first 10 days of flight. Menus and supplemental food for the remainder of the mission were selected in real time from the food pantry.&quot;
153:48:46||alsj|&quot;The inflight menus were designed to provide approximately 2400 kilocalories per man per day with 400 additional kilocalories in beverages and extra food supplied in the pantry. Thus a total of 2800 kilocalories were available for each crewman on a daily basis. On launch day, each crewman was also provided with a specially prepared and packaged frozen sandwich, a package of bacon squares, and a beverage powder.  These items were stowed in a pocket of the pressure suits.&quot;
153:48:46||alsj|&quot;Estimates of the crews' food consumption, based on the onboard food log and the returned food, indicate that an average of 2801, 2372, and 2568 kilocalories per day were consumed by the Commander, the Command Module Pilot, and the Lunar Module Pilot, respectively. The crew commented favorably after the flight on the quality of the inflight food and the food systems. The new insuit food bars were used by both lunar module crewmen on the first and second extravehicular activities. They did not carry the food bar on the third extravehicular activity.&quot;
153:48:46||alsj|In comparison, for Apollo 16, a 10.5 pound (4.8 kg) 'food assembly' was flown in the cabin and two 4.6 pound (2.1 kg) 'food assemblies' were flown in the MESA.  The total is 19.7 pounds (9.0 kg), about 4.3 pounds (2.0 kg) more than was flown on Apollo 15.  Note that the 'food assemblies' do not include the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">in-suit beverage assemblies</a> which, in the case of Apollo 16, each included a 32-(liquid)ounce bags of potasium-fortified orange drink, which was provided to prevent a recurrence of the heart arhythmias experienced by the Apollo 15 crew.
153:48:46||alsj|Additional detail is provded by the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Apollo 16 Mission Report</a>: &quot;Menus were designed to provide a minimum of 130 milli-equivalents of potassium per man per day for this mission. Foods high in natural potassium were selected and some beverages were fortified with potassium gluconate. The menus supplied approximately 2600 kilocalories per man per day. This value was based on the calculated nutritional requirements of each crewman.&quot;]
153:48:46||alsj|&quot;For the first time on an Apollo mission, a preflight and postflight control diet was provided to the crew. The purpose of this control diet was twofold; to insure that each crewman was in an optimum nutritional state prior to launch, and to facilitate postflight interpretation of medical laboratory data. The control diet was initiated three days prior to flight and terminated two days after recovery. In addition, food and fluid intake was closely monitored during the flight. Preliminary estimates of the inflight food consumption, based on crew reports, indicate that an average of 2150, 1408, and 1900 kilocalories per day were consumed by the Commander, Command Module Pilot, and the Lunar Module Pilot, respectively. Postflight, the crew commented favorably on the quality of the food, but stated that they could not consume the quantity provided. They also stated that they had an inadequate amount of time to prepare and eat their food because the meal periods were continually interrupted and shortened by other activities.&quot;]
153:48:46||alsj|The available information indicates that the flown Apollo 16 weight of LM 'food assemblies' was 28 percent higher than on Apollo 15.  Although the average caloric allowance for the mission as a whole was reduced from 2800 to 2600  kilocalories, this reduction may not be representative of the food flown in the LM.  Most importantly, while the Apollo 15 crew consumed nearly all of their foodstocks and had overall caloric intakes close to the planned 2800 kilocalories per man per day, the Apollo 16 crew ate far less than their 2600 kilocalorie daily allowance.  Charlie's statement about there being enough food to feed 'the trojan  army' may say more about his appetite and John's than about the actual amount of food.

154:04:05|Jones|alsj|As somebody completely unfamiliar with this process, this all seems to be a very large number of changes in a complicated machine and system and, yet, I hear you just write it down and get the impression it all made sense to you.  Can you give me any sense of how they went about these changes?
154:04:05|Duke|alsj|Well, the kids were experts in the systems.  And it was a monumental job.  And, while we're out on the surface, they're changing everything.  ('They' being) the guys responsible in the support rooms in Mission Control and, also, the engineering staff at Houston.  And they've got contractor support (and) they've got simulator support.
154:04:05||alsj|&quot;So, they would get everything in the configuration we were in and then they would power up.  First, they'd go through the systems to get everything on line, using schematics and stuff like that.  And then they would verify everything in the simulator.  And even with all of that, we found one or two little mistakes later on.  But I was really impressed, you know, trying to re-write all this stuff.  'Cause, I mean, these books took weeks to get published; and they were doing these changes in just a few hours.  The most monumental task, of course, was Apollo 13.  It was an emergency and it had to be right.  But (on Apollo 13), we just went through all the simulators and everything we sent up to them, we had tried out in the simulator to make sure it worked.  And I think, most of this they did in the simulator or, at least, checked it out in a procedures trainer.&quot;]
154:04:05|Jones|alsj|Now, what's the difference between a procedures trainer and a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">simulator</a>?&quot;]
154:04:05|Duke|alsj|The simulator was actually a whole vehicle.  The astronauts didn't have any procedures trainers.  But these people who were responsible for those systems, they had a panel with switches and stuff, just sort of an engineering mock-up, more than anything.  I wouldn't call it a procedures trainer; that's probably a bad word.  And, so, they would check it out on that - switch positions and stuff - and, most of the time, it was powered up.  And, then, they would run the whole thing in the simulator (and) make sure it was okay.  But it was a big task;  I was really impressed.&quot;]
154:04:05|Jones|alsj|Would there be dozens of people involved in this, between writing down what they thought the changes were and then actually going and trying things out.&quot;]
154:04:05|Duke|alsj|Dozens.  Oh, yeah.
154:04:05|Jones|alsj|And all of them about thirty years old...
154:04:05|Duke|alsj|Well, probably younger than that, on average.  They were young, dedicated guys and gals, who knew the systems and they knew how it worked.  They could look at these schematics and say, 'Oh, yeah; we need to do this and do that' to get it all to work.  And they just knew how to do it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

154:15:41|Duke|alsj|John's just saying, 'we have plenty of consumables, why are you rushing us?'
154:15:41|Jones|alsj|As in, 'everybody's rushing around, there must be a fire someplace'.&quot;]
154:15:41|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  You know how it is.  'Fire! Fire!' And everybody's rushing around.  So he says, if we've got plenty of consumables, why are we doing that?  And you listen at the Flight Director's loop and the docs are saying 'don't eat into the sleep period, don't eat into the sleep period'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
154:15:41||alsj|When John and Charlie are on the surface, only John is transmitting to the LM and Houston wants John to have the good antenna.  Charlie will always be close to him and won't really need an intact OPS antenna.  Jim Irwin broke his OPS antenna at the start of the first Apollo 15 EVA and there was no noticeable comm degradation.<p>

154:15:41||alsj|Prior to 1967, NASA had planned to have only one of the LM crewmen go outside on an EVA.  When that decision was changed, it was discovered that it would not be possible to easily re-design the communications system so that both astronauts could transmit simultaneously to the LM.  It was decided, however, that one of the PLSSs could serve as a relay station, picking up voice and data from the non-relay astronaut and then sending the combined voice and data from both astronauts to the LM.  The Commander's PLSS was modified to serve this function.  See <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LMcomm.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 2</a> in &quot;Apollo Experience Report: Lunar Module Communications System&quot;, NASA document MSC-04031 by R.H. Dietz, D.E. Rhoades, and L.J. Davidson, 1972.
154:18:52|Jones|alsj|Were the PRDs in a suit pocket or something?&quot;]
154:18:52|Duke|alsj|They were in the suit somewhere - I've forgotten exactly where - and we had the suits all folded up back on the Ascent Engine cover and it was just going to be a big deal digging those out.  I remember; they were inside the neckring.  There was the silk liner inside the suit; you just un-Velcroed that and there was a little pocket that they stuck in, if I remember.  So it was going to be a big deal getting them all out.&quot;]

154:19:59||alsj|The checklist item &quot;MCC-H&quot; was a scheduled opportunity for extra discussions with Houston but, in reality, it was usually just padding in the timeline that could be dropped if the crew was running behind.
154:19:59||alsj|The following is from a 1997 exchange of e-mail.
154:19:59|Jones|alsj|One of our eagle-eyed Contributors, Brian Lawrence, suggested that the Wheel might be local hangout.  If so, what do you remember about it?  Is it a place you might have gone with John and others during training, say after a long day of sims?
154:19:59|England|alsj|The Wheel - maybe it was Singing Wheel or Swinging Wheel - was a Country-and-Western type place near JSC.  I didn't go there more than a couple of times, so I don't remember very much about it.  John hardly ever joined others after work; but Charlie, the backup crew, the trainers, any visiting scientists, and I often went out for a beer if we were on travel  - but not in Houston.  We didn't socialize that much when we were in Houston.  When we were home, most of us wanted to take advantage of it.
154:19:59||alsj|Journal Contributor Chris Gainor notes that Gene Kranz discusses the Singing Wheel on page 152 of his book </i>Failure is Not an Option<i>, providing a description and indicating that it was a hangout for Gemini-Apollo-era flight controllers.
154:19:59||alsj|Sy Liebergot, one of the veteran flight controllers, discusses the Singing Wheel at some length - pages 87-89 and elsewhere - in his excellent book with David Harland, &quot;Apollo EECOM: Journey of a Lifetime&quot;, and mentions that, of the astronauts, only Jack Schmitt, Charlie Duke, and Fred Haise frequently joined the flight controllers at their favorite hangout.
154:21:05||alsj|The North Ray impact dug out rocks from a depth of at least 200 meters and, because it is 10 km from South Ray, may have sampled a different formation.  Similarities and differences between samples collected from the two impacts will say a lot about the site.
154:21:46||alsj|This is a reference to the heart irregularities seen in both members of the Apollo 15 crew, a condition believed to have been caused by potassium deficiencies.  Because John and Charlie are getting plenty of potassium, they are not showing abnormalities.  Journal Contributor Garry Kennedy notes that occasional problems with arrhythmias crop up in the Shuttle/Mir era.  In July 1997, during the days following the collision of an unmanned Progress supply ship with Russia's Mir Space Station, the mission commander experienced what were probably stress-induced arrhythmias and was sufficiently incapacitated that repair operations were postponed until a fresh crew arrived.
154:21:57||alsj|This means that the Flight Surgeon wants to look at John's heart and that Charlie can take his sensors off.]</i></blockquote>
154:22:13||alsj|This is House Rock.
154:22:13|Jones|alsj|If I'm remembering right, you saw House Rock during the landing.  Could you see it from the spacecraft, here at the landing site?
154:22:13|Duke|alsj|No, not from...I couldn't look out the window and see it.  When we pitched over and I looked up there, that's when I was talking about it.
154:22:38||alsj|This is the feature they encountered at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvlm2.html#1483907" target="new" target="alsj">148:39:07</a> during the drive back to the LM.  Charlie is suggesting that it was created by some process having to do with the Moon, itself, as opposed to being an impact feature.]</i></blockquote>
154:23:35||alsj|Astronaut Stu Roosa, who flew as the Apollo 14 Command Module Pilot, has taken over as CapCom.
154:36:49||alsj|&quot;Percy Precision&quot; is what Charlie called John at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.landing.html#1043106" target="new" target="alsj">104:31:06</a>, Shortly after the landing.]</i></blockquote>
154:38:12|Duke|alsj|Probably something like 'that calls for a cool one'.  I would imagine.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
154:40:10||alsj|Houston had assumed that John and Charlie were ready to go to sleep and had changed comm configurations to match the presumed, rest-period configuration in the LM.
154:42:49||alsj|Houston will make the wake-up call at a Ground Elapsed time of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva3wake.html#1623832" target="new" target="alsj">162:38:32</a> or 6:32 a.m. Houston time and not 7 a.m. as Roosa indicates here.
154:42:49|Jones|alsj|I don't remember if you talked about it in 'Moonwalker' or not, but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the mysterious thing about how Deke picked people to be on crews.
154:42:49|Duke|alsj|I think we mentioned it.  Just to recap, to me it's a mystery how crews were selected.  My suspicion is that Deke and Al Shepard, who was Chief of the Astronaut Office, got together and they picked the Commanders and the Commanders sort of looked at the pool of potentials and said, well, I think this guy ought to go, he's ready.  And this guy, etc.  And then it had some approval process it went through up the chain of command, which I don't know how much that was changed.  The only change I know of that happened after the crews were announced...I mean, sicknesses, that's a different matter.  Apollo 13 had a change right before launch, but that's because the doctors just said he (meaning Ken Mattingly) couldn't go because he might get the measles.  But the only other thing was on Apollo 14; the backup crew was Cernan and Evans and Engle and Joe didn't get to go because they put Jack in.  And he hadn't been on a backup crew.  So that was a change that was probably done by management because of the nature of Jack's education background.  But even that was...They just made an announcement one day: that's the way it's going to be.  Everybody salutes and says, 'Yes, sir!' And you go on your way.  There was never any politicking for missions, that I knew of.&quot;]
154:42:49|Jones|alsj|Were there, in a general kind of sense, some people who came up to speed on the spacecraft systems and showed real competence...&quot;]
154:42:49|Duke|alsj|No.
154:42:49|Jones|alsj|Or was it kind of uniform across the pool of people?&quot;]
154:42:49|Duke|alsj|Well, you never got in a simulator.  They didn't know.  You didn't have any tests; 'cause they only had a couple of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new" target="alsj">simulators</a> and the only people who ever got in the simulators were the crews.
154:42:49|Jones|alsj|Prime and backup
154:42:49|Duke|alsj|They'd have two or three missions working towards the beginning.  While Apollo 7 was flying, 8 and 9 were training and they were already picked.  If you weren't on one of those crews you didn't get in a simulator.  So it wasn't a matter of knowledge and expertise in the systems.  I don't know what it was.
154:42:49|Jones|alsj|Perception on Deke's part, I would guess.  Certainly, everything that I've read that any of you have ever written says it was a mysterious process.&quot;]
154:42:49|Duke|alsj|Still is today, to me.
154:42:49||alsj|Note, the times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update.
||alsj|Astronaut Donald &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson is the Wake-up CapCom.  Procedures for this part of the mission start on Surface 5-7.
||alsj|Because of the six-hour delay in landing, energy use is being kept to a minimum.  At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2post.html#1542126" target="new" target="alsj">154:21:26</a>, just before they started the rest period, they switched to Low Bit Rate and Down Voice Backup, which is why the comm from the LM is weak.  They will switch to High Bit Rate and Normal Voice at 162:42:29, below.</i></blockquote>
162:42:29||alsj|After getting out of the hammocks, John and Charlie are stowing hammocks and the sleep restraints in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new" target="alsj">jettison bag</a>, as per the handwritten note on Surface 5-7.  Originally, John and Charlie had planned to have three sleep periods while they were on the Moon, one after each of the EVAs.  However, because of the six-hour landing delay, they had their first sleep period before EVA-1, the second before EVA-2, and have just completed the third.  They will return to lunar orbit after EVA-3 and will not have another rest period until they are back in the Command Module.]</i></blockquote>
162:48:23||alsj|Details for the meals can be found in  the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LM11Menu.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LM Menu</a> given in the Apollo 16 Press Kit ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_PressKit.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">5.6 Mb</a>  PDF ).
162:48:23||alsj|Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence comments &quot;I must admit I didn't know what 'romaine soup' was - neither did Gill -  but a bit of research revealed that romaine is a variety of lettuce.  If that's what the soup was made from, I'm not surprised that neither John nor Charlie ate it!&quot;
162:50:24||alsj|These are launch times for upcoming Command Module passes over the landing site.  Each of the launch times is followed by the TPI, Terminal Phase Initiation, time at which they will start the final rendezvous maneuvers.  T46 is the launch time for the 46th Command Module pass.
162:52:51||alsj|Journal Contributor Larry Turoski writes, &quot; When I was in the Air Force, the phrase 'That's Charlie' or 'That's a Charlie' was synonymous with 'Affirmative' or 'That's correct.' Most of us didn't use it, though, because it was too cumbersome a phrase, especially when "Roger" would do. I don't recall ever using it myself. It was used enough, though, to remain in my memory. I believe Pete Conrad uses it somewhere in the Apollo 12 transcript. &quot;
162:52:51||alsj|Among other places, Pete used 'That's Charlie' at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a12/a12.landing.html#1094505" target="new" target="alsj">109:45:05</a> during the Apollo 12 landing.</i></blockquote>
162:53:19||alsj|The difference between the Journal time and the Mission Time being kept in Houston represents an 11 minute 48 seconds clock update that was done at about 118 hours to simplify operations at the new lift-off time.  See the discussion at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1wake.html#1155523" target="new" target="alsj">115:55:23</a>.
162:53:55||alsj|To conserve power, John and Charlie turned off the Mission Timer and their only time pieces are their watches, which are set to Houston time.
162:54:00||alsj|Although both John and Charlie are wearing biomed sensors, only one is transmitted to Houston while they are in the cabin.  Houston is asking Charlie to change a switch setting so the Flight Surgeon can look at the data from Charlie's sensors to make sure they are still functioning properly.
162:55:24||alsj|After checking their Liquid Cooled Garments (LCGs) as per Surface 5-7, John and Charlie will have breakfast.
162:58:07||alsj|The EVCS is the Extravehicular Communications System.]</i></blockquote>
162:58:32||alsj|The tip of John's OPS antenna broke off when he climbed into the LM at the end of EVA-2.  His PLSS is the one which contains the EVCS radio gear capable of transmitting both his and Charlie's voice and data to the LM or the Rover and Houston wants him to have the good OPS antenna.  See Figure 1-3 in the LCRU Operations Manual.
162:58:32||alsj|EVA CapCom Tony England takes over from Peterson.
163:45:32||alsj|As per checklist pages Surface 5-7 and 5-9, John and Charlie are supposed to start suit donning 1 hour 25 minutes after wake-up.  Wake-up was at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1623832" target="new" target="alsj">162:38:32</a>, so only 1 hour 7 minutes have elapsed.  Tony's next transmission may be just a &quot;hello&quot;, but may also be a subtle inquiry as to where John and Charlie are in the checklist.
163:46:00||alsj|This observation suggests that the crystalline rocks they found - and there weren't very many - were all highly shocked, probably in the South Ray impact.
163:46:44||alsj|As indicated in the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266-s.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-I, III 2 of 2</a>&quot; map, they had planned to make two stops on the rim of North Ray Crater, at the locations marked &quot;11&quot; and &quot;12&quot;.

||alsj|In Houston, EVA Flight Director Pete Frank and the Orange Team are relieving Gerry Griffin and the Gold Team.
164:16:35||alsj|Wake-up was at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva3wake.html#1623832" target="new" target="alsj">162:38:32</a> and they had planned to start the LMP <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new" target="alsj">suit donning</a> about 1 hour 25 minutes later and the CDR suit donning about 25 minutes after that.  See checklist pages Surface 5-7, 5-8, and 5-9.  It has actually been 1 hour 38 minutes since wake-up and they are about 10 minutes ahead of the timeline.
164:33:50||alsj|Earlier, Houston had told Charlie that they would like to do the Battery Management at 164:45 and Charlie was probably about to ask if Houston wanted to wait until that time.
164:34:35||alsj|These are the handwritten values in the on-board Surface Checklist and these were probably entered as John and Charlie got into their suits.
164:39:00||alsj|The times used in the Journal differ from the Mission Time being kept in Houston by  11 minute 48 seconds due to a clock update that was done at about 118 hours to simplify operations at the new lift-off time.

165:00:27||alsj|The comm is noisy but readable
165:00:36||alsj|Charlie has just done the &quot;Verify Voice Comm with Houston&quot; step.

It is now 2 hours 22 minutes after wake-up and they are about 44 minutes ahead of the timeline.  John's next transmission corresponds to the last two steps on Surface 6-3.  While they are on PLSS comm in the cabin, the audio quality is not very good.]</i></blockquote>
165:06:12||alsj|When John moves his head forward and down so he can read the indicators on the top of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-RCU.html" target="new" target="alsj">RCU</a>, he either catches his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new" target="alsj">drink bag</a> valve on the right side of his head or puts pressure on the bag with his neck and squirts himself with the potassium-laced contents.
165:07:37||alsj|Here, Charlie is verifying that these two circuit breakers are already open.  Next, he will turn to face the ECS controls and will change the settings while John reads the steps.  In his next transmission, John notices a step Charlie forgot or, at least, didn't call out.]</i></blockquote>

Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso.  In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.

The elapsed time since wake-up has actually been 2 hour 47 minutes and they are now 46 minutes ahead of the timeline.  Despite the apparent troubles they had with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LEVA.html" target="new" target="alsj">LEVA</a> and helmet donning, they have only lost about a minute since <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1651143" target="new" target="alsj">165:11:43</a>.  Proper seating, sealing, and locking of the helmets and gloves is, of course, critical to their ability to do the EVA and the crews always exercised due care.]</i></blockquote>
165:28:37||alsj|A pressure decrease of about 0.2 psi - due to leaks and breathe-down - is normal and anything less than 0.3 psi is acceptable.]</i></blockquote>
165:31:20||alsj|EVA-3 has started.
165:32:57||alsj|They are waiting for the cabin pressure to decrease below 0.2 psi so they can open the hatch.
165:33:23||alsj|The NASA Public Affairs commentator tells the press that the surface temperature is about 185 F (85 C) and has been rising steadily with the increasing Sun elevation.]</i></blockquote>
165:34:47||alsj|Evidently, Tony does not hear the question.  As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp006.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, the Sun's elevation is currently about 45 degrees.
165:34:47||alsj|John and Charlie have now finished the procedures on Surface 6-7.

165:40:19||alsj|By going to Reset, John ends the measurement that was in progress.
165:41:04||alsj|Charlie is wearing John's OPS, which has a red stripe on it.  John is still the only one with stripes on his helmet, sleeves, and legs.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-CDRStripes.html" target="new" target="alsj">Distinguishing stripes</a> were first added to the commander's suit on Apollo 13 so that the astronauts could be identified in the TV and photographs.

165:41:29||alsj|Because John is still busy with the UV camera, Charlie wants to take care of the LCRU/TV procedures on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR26-27.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-27</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR28-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-28</a>.  Note that Tony doesn't respond to Charlie's question by reading up all the steps.  As a consequence, in a few minutes John and Tony will have to double check and make sure everything gets done.]</i></blockquote>
165:43:07||alsj|John is telling Charlie that Tony is reading up new pointing angles for the UV camera.]</i></blockquote>
165:43:23||alsj|Evidently, Tony did not hear John's temperature report at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1654213" target="new" target="alsj">165:42:13</a>.
165:44:05||alsj|The NASA Public Affairs commentator tells the press that the TV pictures won't be available until the signal is acquired at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid</a>, &quot;where we have our communications lines set up between Madrid and Houston.

165:45:08||alsj|Tony mentioned this added 500-mm pan during the EVA planning discussion at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva3wake.html#1634646" target="new" target="alsj">163:46:46</a> and said he would mention it again at this time.

Now that John has finished up the LCRU power-up that Charlie started and the dusting he started shortly after 165:46:57, he's looked at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR28-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-29</a> and has decided to pick up the final item in the ETB section, which Charlie hasn't yet done.  The &quot;pallet&quot; is probably the geopallet on the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
165:47:45||alsj|John's question suggests that it was usually Charlie who did this task in training.
165:50:01||alsj|This is item 1 under LCRU Power-up and Bat(tery) on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR26-27.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-27</a>.

John will not install the new battery at this time but will stow it under the CDR seat.]</i></blockquote>
165:50:59||alsj|Charlie's  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1655038.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">500-mm Stone Mountain pictures</a> are AS16-105- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17053" target="new" target="alsj">17053</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17116" target="new" target="alsj">17116</a>.]
165:50:59||alsj|TV on.  The camera is pointed more or less west and the Solar Wind Collector (SWC) is at the right side of the picture.
165:51:44||alsj|While John unstows the spare Rover battery, Charlie takes a 16-mm magazine to the DAC as per item 2 on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-28.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-28</a> and then checks the camera setting as per the last line on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-29</a>.]
165:51:44||alsj|As Fendell continues to pan, we see the area south of the Rover criss-crossed with Rover tracks which have darkened the surface. Fendell stops the pan with the right-front Rover wheel at the left side of the picture and then reverses direction.]</i></blockquote>
165:53:29||alsj|Gene Cernan will have a similar problem during Apollo 17.]
165:53:29||alsj|As Fendell looks toward the north, we see a trail of very dark footprints.  These are crossed by a set of Rover tracks, which are not nearly so dark.  The surface looks relatively soft and, on such a surface, John and Charlie probably kicked a great deal of dirt around as they walked.  In contrast, the primary effect of the Rover wheels is to compact the surface and, at least at low speeds, only a small amount of soil is picked up by the wire mesh and scattered on the undisturbed surface on either side of the tracks.  Jack Schmitt has speculated that, during the landing, the descent engine sweeps away large numbers of very small particles and leaves a surface with a higher-than-normal population of larger particles.  These are effective sunlight reflectors and the net result is a bright surface in the immediate vicinity of the LM.  Schmitt speculates that, when the surface is disturbed by walking astronauts or by the Rover, the surface is actually restored to something more closely resembling its normal reflectivity and looks dark in comparison to the brightened soil.  This scene seems to support Schmitt's conjecture.]</i></blockquote>
165:54:15||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat where he is holding one of the Hasselblads.  He looks toward John, who is in the background at the MESA.  Fendell continues his clockwise pan, but soon reaches the stop.  Fendell then reverses direction and we find that Charlie has joined John at the MESA.
165:54:15||alsj|In Houston, Flight Director Pete Frank concludes that, because they still have a good battery in the Rover, there is no point in wasting any more time trying to free the spare.]</i></blockquote>
165:54:58||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right.  He doesn't appear to be wearing a camera and is probably going to the CDR seat to get John's so he can take the pan called out on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-29</a>.  As John wrestles with the spare battery, the MESA jiggles.  After a few seconds of this, the battery obviously comes loose.
165:55:12||alsj|The TV images moves a little, probably as Charlie gets John's camera, which he will use for the pan because it contains color film.
165:55:16||alsj|John goes off-camera to the right.  Fendell follows and finds him as he puts the battery in the seat pan.
165:55:23||alsj|Charlie will take the pan from a spot west of the ladder strut and, therefore, from a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">plus-Z</a> position in LM coordinates.

He reaches into the seatpan and pulls out a Sample Collection Bag (SCB), probably in anticipation of the PLSS Load-up, and then brushes the checklist with his right hand, apparently going back to review <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR26-27.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-27</a>.]</i></blockquote>
165:55:23||alsj|Having completed his review, John turns his checklist page back the way it was, probably to review <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR28-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR28-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-29</a>.
165:56:30||alsj|Each frame on magazine 116/E shows a set of smudges.  Detail of the smudge pattern change only slowly from the begining of the magazine to the end.  The smudges are undoubtedly the result of contact of a dust-ladened, damp cloth with the reseau plate in John's camera during an attempt the clean enough dust off the camera to make the settings readable.

165:57:02||alsj|John walks toward the MESA carrying the SCB.  He is waiting for Charlie so they can do the PLSS Load-up.  Readers should note that this interval corresponds to a spike in Charlie's heart-rate record, which is shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-5b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-5(b)</a> in the Mission Report.  I am inclined to believe that the spike is the result of a spurious data point because there is nothing in the dialog or in the audio tape to suggest strenuous activity.]</i></blockquote>
165:57:16||alsj|John comes around the back of the Rover to the LMP seat, still carrying the SCB.]</i></blockquote>
165:57:25||alsj|John grabs a second SCB from Charlie's footpan and joins Charlie at the back of the Rover.  Charlie is just off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>
165:57:27||alsj|John hands the second SCB to Charlie.  Evidently they had trained with the Special Environment Sample Container stowed in John's SCB.  Bag 4 is not the one that goes on John's PLSS. They don't give Houston the number of the second SCB;  it will fall off John's PLSS at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta11.html#1663415" target="new" target="alsj">166:34:15</a> during the drive to North Ray Crater.]</i></blockquote>
165:57:49||alsj|John turns to face the front of the Rover, presenting the left side of his PLSS and then steps to his left to get a bit closer to Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
165:58:56||alsj|Charlie bounces sideways until he is behind the right side of John's PLSS.  John leans forward, supporting himself on the back of the Rover and, thereby, raises the bottom of his PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
165:59:06||alsj|Charlie pulled up on the tool harness to tighten it and John started tipping to his left as a result.]</i></blockquote>
165:59:06||alsj|John and Charlie have more or less changed places.  Charlie is now standing down-Sun of John with the right side of his PLSS presented. John attaches SCB-4 to Charlie's PLSS.  The top attachment seats easily and then John steps to his left to get behind Charlie and pulls out the bottom strap that has been hanging down, presumably from the tool harness.  See Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-62.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-62</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission Report.]
165:59:06||alsj|Charlie glances at his checklist which, apparently, jogs his memory, even though there is no mention of the following item in his cuff checklist.]</i></blockquote>
165:59:38||alsj|At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva3prep.html#1652947" target="new" target="alsj">165:29:47</a>, just before the Cabin Depress as per Surface 6-6, Charlie was supposed to turn off the MESA heater by opening the circuit breaker.  As Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes, MESA heating is no longer required because all the food and other items requiring temperature control have been removed.]</i></blockquote>
165:59:58||alsj|After getting the strap threaded through a fabric loop near the bottom on the PLSS-ward side of the SCB, John kneels so he can press the Velcro patch on the end of the strap to the corresponding patch sewn on the bottom of Charlie's PLSS.  This may be the best record of an SCB attachment in the Apollo video record. John stands, flips the top of the SCB closed, and then steps forward to press the latch closed.]</i></blockquote>
166:00:15||alsj|John looks at his checklist to make sure he has finished all the tasks on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR28-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-29</a>.  Charlie checks <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-29.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-29</a>.  Readers will note that John has not called out the steps involving the core cap dispenser, the hammer, and the extra packs of sample bags but may have taken care of those earlier.]</i></blockquote>
166:00:24||alsj|Charlie scans his checklist.
166:00:35||alsj|John heads toward the UV camera, which is hidden by the Rover seats, and Charlie bounds off-camera to the left.  Fendell follows John.
166:00:52||alsj|John reported the battery temperature at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1654213" target="new" target="alsj">165:42:13</a>.  Near the UV camera, John bobs to one knee twice, undoubtedly to retrieve something.
166:01:44||alsj|Charlie comes into view and reaches into his seatpan.  For the next minute or so, he appears to be working on his seatbelt.
166:01:49||alsj|John runs toward the Rover.
166:02:06||alsj|Charlie props the end of his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new" target="alsj">seatbelt</a> on a support next to the console to get it out of the way.  He then gets an empty SCB out of the seatpan and, finally, closes the seat.
166:02:43||alsj|Charlie takes the empty SCB to the back of the Rover and attaches it to the HTC behind the LMP seat.  He then goes off-camera to the left.
166:03:06||alsj|Charlie comes into view, takes hold of the DAC staff and rotates the camera, possibly to check the settings.  He then goes off-camera to the left.
166:03:33||alsj|During the return to the LM at the end of EVA-2, the Rover Navigation system stopped working.  Although Houston believes the problem was caused by improper switch settings, the health of the Nav system won't be known until John and Charlie are on their way to North Ray Crater.
166:03:33|Duke|alsj|I was unsure that the Nav system was going to be working; and so I ran out 50 to 100 yards to the north of the Rover and turned around and tried to sight on something between the LM and Stone Mountain.  And my thought was, we can always see Stone Mountain and I'll pick a spot and we'll just aim for that spot on Stone Mountain and, if we've been going mostly directly north, when we come back, if we're not in our tracks, we'd just head for that point.  And that would get us back.&quot;]
166:03:33|Jones|alsj|You wouldn't be far off.
166:03:33|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
166:03:33|Jones|alsj|I imagine it would have been a hard place to get lost in with all the landmarks around.&quot;]
166:03:33|Duke|alsj|It'd be easy.  You don't see a lot of many of the things; a lot of the landmarks, you know, are down in those swales and all, and they all just disappear.  You know, if you went out and back in your set of tracks, you're okay; but the big loops we did, like on EVA-2, when we thought we lost the Nav, John was biasing back to the east so that, eventually, we'd run across our tracks.  But, you know, you could be a hundred yards away from something and, if you're on the wrong side of the hill, you wouldn't see it.  I'm glad we had the Navigation system.  I would have hated to have been up there without one.&quot;]
166:03:33||alsj|John heads for the Rover.
166:04:05||alsj|Fendell starts panning left.
166:04:35||alsj|TV off.
166:05:29|Jones|alsj|I gather that, after the experience the 15 crew had with Jim's seatbelt not fitting right, you spent some time in the one-sixth-g (KC-135) aircraft <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new" target="alsj">adjusting your seatbelts</a>?&quot;]
166:05:29|Duke|alsj|We did, yeah.  We got a new belt, a new design; and then we went up in the one-sixth gravity in the airplane and adjusted everything so it would be preset for us.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
166:05:37||alsj|The LRV power-up configuration is shown in the LRV Operations Decal, which is Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp302.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.7-9</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.

166:05:39||alsj|John will turn the Rover until he is headed directly down-Sun as indicated by the Sun-Shadow Device.  See <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-27.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 1-27</a> in the LRV Operations Handbook.]</i></blockquote>
166:07:03||alsj|During the drive up Stone Mountain to Station 4, the pitch scale de-bonded and fell into the bottom of the instrument, but the indicator needle stayed in place.  John got used to the pitch indicator during training and can estimate his pitch from the position of the needle relative to the case.]</i></blockquote>
||alsj|The planned EVA-3 traverse is shown in the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp265.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">EVA-I-III 2 of 2 Contour Map</a>&quot; and in the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266-s.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-I, III 2 of 2</a>&quot; map.  Because of the delayed landing, John and Charlie will drive, as planned, to the rim of North Ray Crater and spend one hour in the general vicinity of the planned locations of Stations 11 and 12.  They will then head back to the LM and make a single stop somewhere on the North Ray ejecta blanket.  Readers may wish to note that Cat Crater, the planned location of Station 14, was named for Charlie's sons, <b>C</b>harles <b>A</b>nd <b>T</b>homas, while Dot Crater, the planned location of Station 16, was named for Charlie's wife, Dotty.
||alsj|Details of the first part of the traverse are shown in the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3</a>&quot; map.  The LM is near CB.1/80.6 and, as indicated on the map, the first leg of the planned traverse is a drive of 0.8 km on a heading of 030.
||alsj|A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">labeled detail from Pan Camera frame 4618</a> shows the area covered during EVA-3 and the locations that coincide with the Nav system readouts Charlie gives during the drive to North Ray.
166:09:51||alsj|Evidently Houston wants to make sure that the DAC doesn't run out of film during the approach to North Ray Crater.
166:09:54||alsj|Charlie may be saying that he will have to hold the DAC to keep it from moving.
166:10:21||alsj|At the end of the EVA, John will park the Rover about 100 meters east of the LM so Houston can watch the lift-off.  With the Rover in that position, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new" target="alsj">Ed Fendell</a> only has to pan the camera up to follow the LM. Charlie is saying that, while the ridge might be a good vantage point, Fendell would have trouble panning left to right to follow the LM once it pitched over at an altitude of 800 feet.  John's concern was the increased thermal load on the front of the Rover with it parked facing south rather than west.
166:10:21||alsj|The following is taken from a conversation I had with Ed Fendell at his Houston office on August 13, 1996.
166:10:21|Jones|alsj|My reason for being here, Ed, is to ask you to talk about how you got prepared for doing the J-mission TV and anything you think readers of the Journal need to know about how the Apollo TV system evolved.
166:10:21|Fendell|alsj|Well, let me give it to you this way.  I'll tell you what I can remember; because I've got a good friend of mine who was one of the senior flight directors at that time - Pete Frank.  Pete and I are pretty good friends and we worked on Habitat for Humanity together and different things.  And he just retired from Loral.  And we were talking about remembering things and he says, 'It's not only the point that you forget things, it's the point that you remember certain things and then somebody else says something and you find out that you remembered it wrong.'  And this conversation went on yesterday; it had nothing to do with you.  A good friend of ours passed away and we had a funeral we had to go to.
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;Anyways, let me see if I can kinda go back and start with the right place and see what I can help you with.&quot;
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;Prior to Apollo 10, all the communications equipment was spread out in the Control Center in different areas.  For example, the Lunar Module communications equipment belonged to the Lunar Module guys.  You know, the TELMU guys.  And the Command Module equipment belonged to the Command Module guys.  And the erectable antenna we had to go on the Moon and the backpack stuff and all that belonged to the experiments people.  On 10, we tried to separate (meaning undock) the two vehicles but we couldn't get a Go on the comm between the Lunar Module and the CSM.  We couldn't make it work.  And we fooled around for two or three hours - I can't remember how long - and, finally, we got it to work and found out that we were just configured wrong.  The Lunar Module guys (at Mission Control) were not talking correctly to the Command Module guys and vice versa.&quot;
166:10:21|Jones|alsj|This was pre-flight?
166:10:21|Fendell|alsj|This was during the mission.  We were out of configuration.  The switches were not matched up between the two vehicles. So we got that straightened out and we separated and went on to do the mission.  When the mission was over, Kranz came up to me - and I go way back; I'm an ex-Capsule Communicator back at the Cape and I'm an ex-air traffic controller.  Anyway, Kranz came up to me said 'We're going to form a communications section, and you're going to run it.'  See, I was an assistant Flight Director in those days.  And I said, 'Yeah'.  And he said, 'We're going to take all this gear out of all the different areas and we're going to put it all into one section and you're going to run it.'  And I said, 'Who am I going to run it with?' And he said, 'the following people.' and there was only three guys who knew communications out of the twelve or so people.  Anyways, we took it over and we started doing it on 11 and then it progressed down the line and we built this thing up and we started coming along.
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;We flew 11, we flew 12, and we got to 13...And, in the meantime, a guy by the name of Bill Perry, an engineer over in the telecommunications division, came up with a design for actually controlling a (TV) camera - from the ground or remotely.  It (meaning Perry's concept) went through a PRCB (Program Review Control Board) to decide whether or not the program wanted to do this.  And each directorate had to come in and make their pitch.&quot;
166:10:21|Jones|alsj|When was this?
166:10:21|Fendell|alsj|I can't remember exactly when this was; but it's kind of an interesting story.  Anyways, I, being a communications guy, went up to make the pitch for Flight Operations Directorate.  At that time, Kraft had just moved from the head of Flight Operations to the head of the Center and he was there at the Board.  And I had a 'one chart'.  My pitch was one slide.  'FOD has no requirement for remote TV.'  That is what it said. That was it.  Well, we got going on this thing and just ahead of me was a fellow by the name of Tony Calio, who later on ended up becoming a director up at NASA Headquarters.  Well, Tony headed up Science and Applications Division, which were the guys who controlled the geologists and everything else.  And he got up there and started making the pitch for them; and he was saying how they had no requirement for this thing.  Well, Kraft got a hold of him and ate him a new butt hole.  I mean, he was chewing him...'What do you mean?  This is stupid.  This is your chance...This is no foresight...'  And he was eating him alive; and I'm sliding down in this chair, trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this.
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;There was a guy by the name of Mel Brooks, who's over in Europe now, and he was the Assistant Director of Flight Operations and he comes running back to me and he says, 'Get rid of your slide!  Get rid of your slide!'  And I said, 'I can't; it's already up with the projectionist.'&quot;
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;So, anyways, he ate on Tony for about forty-five minutes.  I don't know how well you know Chris, but Chris can just eat you alive.  He's a good friend of mine; but he's the most outstanding person I've ever met in my life.&quot;
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;Well, he gets all done with him (meaning Calio) and I walk up there and the guy throws up my slide.  And the place just came apart. Everybody just started hollering and I thought Kraft was going to die.&quot;
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;Well, that's how it all started.  The end result is we were directed to go off and do this.  They put together what they called a Tiger Team and it works out that the guy who did the actual procurement job - he was the procurement officer - is running this building (that houses Ed's 1996 office).  And there was this guy Bill Perry, and another guy by the name of Olin Graham out of telecommunications, who was his boss.  And there was - oh - about eight of us.  And it was sole-sourced to RCA-Camden (New Jersey) to build the LCRU.  It (meaning the development of the TV and the LCRU) was a two-pronged thing: they (RCA-Camden) were going to build the LCRU and then, (for construction of the TV camera), a procurement went out and an RFP (Request for Proposal).  We had two bidders (on the camera) - RCA-Hightstown (New Jersey) and Westinghouse - and, after doing the Source Board, RCA-Hightstown was picked over Westinghouse.  Westinghouse had the Command Module camera.&quot;
166:10:21||alsj|&quot;We started traveling back and forth and working it.  And we worked it a little different from normally;  they basically took Bill Perry's design on the camera controls (TCU) and implemented the whole thing together.  Both companies bid, basically, on Bill Perry's control design (for) the camera and the motors and the gears.&quot;
166:10:21|Jones|alsj|I know the setup from a crew operations perspective where they mount the LCRU on the front of the Rover and then they mount the TCU and then the camera.
166:10:21|Fendell|alsj|So, that was all put together and we started training.  And the real question came about: 'Well, how are we going to do this?'  One, we had to put in commands in the Control Center to operate it.
166:10:21|Jones|alsj|And it's called a 'three-degree command' because that's how far it goes, about half the width of the six-degree field-of-view (at minimum zoom).
166:10:21|Fendell|alsj|Yeah.  So we had increments for left and right (and) zoom in and out.  So that you could tweak (the pointing and zoom).  See, you've got to understand you had that delay time on the camera (response).
166:10:21|Jones|alsj|Absolutely.
166:10:21|Fendell|alsj|So we built the commands to do that.  (For example), on the thing you saw when the Lunar Module lifted off, those commands were not sent by watching the Lunar Module.  They were sent on time (that is, at pre-planned times relative to the instant of lift-off), because we were moving the camera to where the Lunar Module was supposed to be. (There was) a fellow named Harley Weyer (pronounced 'wire'), who worked for me and is now retired from NASA,  and Harley had figured all that out.  And that's the way that worked.  We watched it going up (in elevation), then opened up (on the zoom), and then (watched it) going down (as the apparent elevation decreased with increasing LM range from the TV).   And we only got to do it right once (on Apollo 17), because the (TCU TV) motors froze the first time (on Apollo 15), etc.
166:10:21||alsj|As usual, Charlie has been taking pictures.  The frames covering the first part of the traverse begin with AS16-111- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18034" target="new" target="alsj">18034</a>.

166:20:39||alsj|John is saying that they have driven 1.7 km since leaving the LM.  The difference between the 1.4 km range and the 1.7 km distance driven is due to the fact that he hasn't driven in a straight line from the LM.

166:29:32||alsj|They have probably just encountered a fresh, sharp-rimmed crater and either went through it or had to slow and then turn quickly to avoid it.  In the Apollo 15 Mission Report, Dave Scott observed that, even on level terrain, if he tried to make a quick turn at a speed greater than about 5 km/hr, the back end would break out and start to swing around.

The Nav system counts wheel rotations to determine distance travelled and, if the wheels are slipping, the indicated distance interval can be signifcantly greater than the actual distance interval.  See the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16PP-NRf3.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">contour map</a> from the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">North Ray Chapter of the Apollo 16 Professional Paper</a>, which shows them climbing about 25 meters in the first 200 meters after passing just east of Station 13.
166:38:01||alsj|North Ray is about 900 meters across and 200 meters deep and John wants to approach the rim slowly enough that he can stop quickly if he finds himself at the edge of a steep drop-off into the crater.
166:38:10||alsj|By this time, Houston has gotten range and bearing readings at enough well-defined locations that they know almost exactly where the LM is and, during this traverse, have an excellent fix at End Crater that shows that the Nav system is working well.  John and Charlie are, indeed, about 500 meters southeast of the rim.

The black, 10-meter boulder at the right is House Rock, which they will visit just before they leave North Ray.  They will park the Rover near the white boulders straight ahead.

166:41:51||alsj|Some geologists had a pre-flight concept of the site as having a variety of volcanic features overlying an anorthositic bedrock. If the North Ray impact was big enough to have penetrated to bedrock, then John and Charlie might have found both black volcanic rocks and white anorthositic rocks.  As it turns out, although House Rock is very dark, it is a breccia and not of volcanic origin.

166:42:56||alsj|The indicated location is on the inner wall of the crater, a clear indication that, by now, the Nav system is overestimating the distance they've travelled.  See the discussion following 166:45:15, below.

166:45:10||alsj|David Harland notes that, although the drive to North Ray has taken far less time than planned, a recommendation is made to the Flight Director not to spend more time at North Ray than had been planned.  Because of the six-hour landing delay, EVA-3 activities have been dramatically curtailed so as not to eat into planned reserves of LM consumables, and this recommendation is consistent with that general approach to the EVA.
166:45:10||alsj|The range and bearing to the LM are <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">4.5/179</a> and the indicated position is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CZ.6/80.2</a>.

The difference between the indicated and actual locations is an unusually large 250 meters.  One possible explanation is that there was more than normal wheel slippage during the climb up to the North Ray rim which, because the Nav system counts wheel rotations to determine distance, would give an overestimate.

The white boulders are about 55 meters west of the Rover.  As can be seen in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ppD2f3.jpg" title="contour map" target="new" target="alsj">post-mission contour map</a>,  the crater is not perfectly circular and has a maximum diameter of about 1100 meters and a minimum diameter of about 1000 meters.  It is about 230 meters deep.  The inner walls are steep - roughly a 30 to 35 degrees slope - and, from John and Charlie's perspective on the rim, a substantial part of the crater is not visible.
166:47:18|Jones|alsj|Meteor Crater (in Arizona) has got really steep walls to it.  Is this that kind of steepness?
166:47:18|Duke|alsj|That kind of steepness; yeah.  It really was.  I mean, it was really scary, getting up too close.  We kidded about it, but we weren't about to get real close.  And we could never (see the bottom)...even on the far (northwest) side.  You know, you get up on the rim of Meteor Crater and you can see the bottom - it was a little bit bigger, I think.  You could see the bottom on the other side but, here, you couldn't.
166:47:18||alsj|Meteor Crater is about 1200 meters in diameter.  As can be seen in an <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16meteorcrtr.gif" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">aerial photo</a> by Dr. David Roddy, the floor of Meteor Crater is flat and covers about half the diameter.

166:48:52||alsj|Frame  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18607" target="new" target="alsj">18607</a> shows Charlie getting the 500mm camera from under the CDR seat.  Apollo 12 astronaut Al Bean used this picture as the basis of one of his most striking paintings, adding John at the other side of the Rover.  David Harland has assembled a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta11lrv.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">portion</a> of the pan that resembles the Bean painting.]
166:48:52||alsj|The fact that John never mentions this pan led me to think that Charlie took it later, at about, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1665537" target="new" target="alsj">166:55:37</a>.  However, Journal Contributor Bob Fry pointed out in 1999 that the astronaut in AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18607" target="new" target="alsj">18607</a> does not have <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-CDRStripes.html" target="new" target="alsj">red stripes</a> on his suit and must be Charlie.  In addition, the relevant video record indicates that John has his camera throughout this interval.
166:49:13||alsj|Charlie runs off-camera to the right, using his skipping stride.  Fendell stops the pan to give the Backroom a chance to get a picture off the monitor.
166:49:13||alsj|The following is taken from a 1996 conversation with Ed Fendell.  See, also, Fendell's October 2000 interview for the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new" target="alsj">JSC Oral History Project</a>.
166:49:13|Jones|alsj|Okay.  The crew pulls up at a geology stop and they turn on the LCRU.  Then you do a pan of the scene.&quot;]
166:49:13|Fendell|alsj|Right.  They pointed the antenna (and) locked the antenna up.  And the first thing we did was what we called a wrap for the science guys, for the USGS guys and so on, and that was put together by a guy named Tim Hait.  He was the guy who coordinated that.  What they wanted to do was to take the camera, swing it all the way to one stop (or pan limit) - either left or right - and then what we would do is we would pan it three degrees, sit a spell, and they would snap a Polaroid picture back in the Backroom.  And we would go all the way around and then, when they had all of that, they would tell us (they had all the pictures) and then we'd go get the crew.  And then they would take that (set of Polaroids) and make a mosaic of it and you've probably have seen pictures of that.  They cut and glued together and they used that for their planning in the back.  The Gordon Swann people, the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lee_silver.html" target="new" target="alsj">Lee Silvers</a>, and Bill Muehlberger and so on.  And then we would swing over and basically follow the crew.
166:49:13||alsj|&quot;Now, every once in a while we would get a call from the back(room) saying, 'Hey, can you swing over and take a look at this?'  And two things were going on.  One, there were certain things they were interested in; but, mostly, they were really interested in what the crew was doing, because the crew was pretty well trained and they were doing the things that they wanted them to do.  But, occasionally they wanted some other pictures to try to figure out exactly where they were...A lot of times, they didn't know how close they were to the pre-planned site.  And other times, like on those big boulders, they wanted some extra shots of the rocks and so on.  And like when Dave Scott got the drill stuck, they wanted a real good look at that to try to figure out what to do.  And things like that.  But, in general, the main thing was to stay with the crew.  Pick a crewman and stay with him.&quot;
166:49:13|Jones|alsj|Did the calls from the Backroom come to you through Flight?
166:49:13|Fendell|alsj|No.  They came to us directly from a guy - I'm trying to remember what he was called.  The Mission Manager.  The Mission Planning Manager.  I forget what it was; but it was one single guy who talked to you.  I think it was a guy named Tim Hait.  He worked for Gordon Swann.  He was a USGS guy.
166:49:34||alsj|A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.northray.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj"> portion</a> of one of Charlie's pans that was assembled by David Harland shows the scene John is describing.
166:49:34||alsj|As Fendell continues the clockwise pan, he finds Charlie joining John at the break in slope that John just described.  As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, they are about 17 meters from the Rover and, if the intervening slope is 10 degrees, they are standing about 3 meters below the TV camera.  Fendell continues the pan and gets a view of the interior of the crater.
166:50:14||alsj|Fendell is now looking at House Rock.  This boulder is 12 meters tall and has lateral dimensions of 16 by 20 meters.  Near the boulder, the surface slopes down toward the north and, consequently, we are not seeing the full vertical extent.  The southwest flank of Smoky Mountain is the background and the slope is littered with boulders ejected from North Ray.
166:50:14||alsj|By collecting samples from the large rocks near the rim, they are certain of giving the geologists back home a look at material dug out by the impact from the deepest part of the crater.  One use of the samples is to estimate the age of North Ray Crater.  Rock that had been buried deep beneath the surface were not exposed to cosmic rays until dug out by the impact and it is possible to use geochemistry techniques to estimate how long the rocks have been exposed.  In 1975, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-CosRayExposur.html" target="new" target="alsj">C.J. Morgan</a> was able to determine that North Ray is about 26 million years old.  In turn, good ages for a number of lunar craters permit improved estimates of the ages of other craters for which the only available indication of age is the number of smaller craters per unit area on the ejecta blanket.
166:50:37||alsj|John is probably referring to the line of boulders about halfway down the visible portion of the north wall in AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18599" target="new" target="alsj">18599</a> and in AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17259" target="new" target="alsj">17259</a>.  See, also, Figure 23 in the North Ray chapter in the Professional Paper.]
166:50:37||alsj|Fendell is looking east toward Ravine Crater, which is dug into the southern flank of Smoky Mountain.  Note the inbound Rover tracks in the foreground and the liberal sprinkling of blocks.]</i></blockquote>
166:51:30||alsj|Fendell is looking over the right-rear fender toward Stone Mountain.
166:51:36||alsj|This is a reference to a group of very light-colored boulders - called the White Rocks - that Shepard and Mitchell found near the rim on Cone Crater during Apollo 14 EVA-2.  See Figures 3-19, -20, -21, -28, -29 and -30 in the Apollo 14 Preliminary Science Report.]</i></blockquote>
166:51:55||alsj|A 'three-rock breccia' consists of a matrix which contain inclusions which, themselves, contain inclusions.  This indicates that, when the three-rock breccia formed, pieces of pre-existing two-rock breccias became the inclusions in the matrix.
166:51:55||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.
166:52:30||alsj|Tuffs are rocks formed of hot volcanic ash which fuses because of internal heat.  If the ash contains pieces of harder rock that was ejected from the throat of the volcano along with the ash, subsequent weathering will tend to erode the ash material first and leave the pieces of harder rock sticking out of the surface.  John is not suggesting that he has collected a piece of tuff but, rather, that the visual impression of the surface texture is tuff-like.  John's grab sample is 67035, a 245-gram, light-matrix breccia which is shown in Figure 62b in the Professional paper.
166:52:30||alsj|Charlie has taken and extensive <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1665320.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">500-mm partial pan</a> consisting of frames AS16-105- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17117" target="new" target="alsj">17117</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17181" target="new" target="alsj">17181</a>.
166:52:30||alsj|Charlie started the 500-mm photos with a left-to-right series along the rim and finished that series with  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17141" target="new" target="alsj">17141</a>.]
166:52:30||alsj|Frames <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17142" target="new" target="alsj">17142</a> to  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17181" target="new" target="alsj">17181</a> are pictures of the interior of the crater.  Although many of these pictures are blurred, they contain useful information.  Digital processing could be used to remove most of the effects of the camera motions that produced the blurring, although I don't believe that has been done as of March 2002.]</i></blockquote>
166:53:38||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie, who is skipping uphill toward the Rover.  John has just started uphill.  Charlie is carrying the 500mm camera and John is clearly wearing his own Hasselblad.  Charlie goes off-camera to the right, still coming uphill.]</i></blockquote>
166:53:43||alsj|During the following transmission, John starts to examine the grab sample and then comes slowly to a stop so he can devote his full attention to it.
166:53:46||alsj|A &quot;zap crater&quot; or &quot;zap pit&quot; is a very small crater blasted into the surface of a rock by a small, high-velocity impactor.
166:53:46||alsj|John starts walking toward the Rover - still examining the sample - and, apparently, is heading for his seat.  Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>
166:54:17||alsj|John goes off-camera to the left and Fendell continues to pan left.
166:54:37||alsj|Fendell finds John at the CDR seat where he is removing a sample bag from the dispenser on his camera.  During Tony's transmission that starts at 54:48, John bags the sample, spins the bag closed, and then folds the metal tabs to seal the bag.  Note that he folds one tab on one side of the bag and the other tab on the opposite side.  This is called &quot;Z-ing&quot;.  This may be the best video of sample bag closure in the Apollo record.  Note that John is still wearing his camera.
166:54:45||alsj|John goes to the back of the Rover, going off-camera to the left.
166:55:29||alsj|Charlie's use of the phrase &quot;pan is complete&quot; contributed to my confusion over the pan that John, in fact, took from below the Rover at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1664906" target="new" target="alsj">166:49:06</a>.  Here, Charlie is using the word &quot;pan&quot; to loosely describe the sequence of Smoky Mountain 500mm pictures he has just completed.  Those photos are frames AS16-105- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17182" target="new" target="alsj">17182</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17215" target="new" target="alsj">17215</a>.]
166:55:29||alsj|Fendell pans right.
166:55:38||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the left front of the Rover. He has the has the 500-mm lens, with its own camera body attached, in his right hand.  He is wearing the LMP camera.
166:55:56||alsj|Fendell continues to pan right.  Once the crater comes back into view, we can see the rays on the north and northwest walls.  They show up as streaks of lighter and darker colored material coming up radially out of the bottom of the crater.
166:56:31||alsj|The far-field polarimetry experiment consists of three partial pans of North Ray Crater, with one taken at each of three settings of the polarization filter - Left, Center, and Right - taken at two separate locations.  The near-field polarimetry experiment, which has been dropped from the station tasks consists of photos taken of selected rocks at phase angles of 90, 110, and 130 degrees.  See <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-30.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-30</a>. ]</i></blockquote>
166:56:56||alsj|As Fendell pans past House Rock, John comes into view.  He is carrying an SCB and starts to run in the general direction of House Rock, intending to go out about 80 meters and, as Houston suggested, sample on the way back to the Rover.  Note that John is not carrying either tongs or a scoop.  Fendell follows him.]
166:56:56|Duke|alsj|If you look at the footprints, here, you can see we're not sinking in very far at all.  It was very firm up there; there's not much dust up on North Ray.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
166:57:04||alsj|As John gets farther from the Rover, Fendell changes both the zoom and the TV pointing.  In the process, he loses John for a few seconds.  Just before John goes off-camera, we see his sample bag dispenser on the ground.  We don't actually see it fall but, from the dialog at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1665755" target="new" target="alsj">166:57:55</a>, we know it falls off at some point during the run.]</i></blockquote>
166:57:04||alsj|The Rover is parked on a north heading, so Charlie is standing northwest of it.]</i></blockquote>
166:57:25||alsj|Tony is probably asking Charlie if he is at the right-hand of the two locations from which he will take partial pans, the generic location shown as a circled &quot;1&quot; on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-30.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-30</a> and in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp192.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  Tony is probably not asking about the setting of the polarizing filter.  In fact, after Charlie takes this first trio of pans, he will move counter-clockwise along the crater rim and, therefore, is currently at the Left position.  See the dialog at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1665935" target="new" target="alsj">166:59:35</a>.  Although Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a> indicates that he is taking these first partial pans from about the same place as he took the unfiltered pan and the 500-mm photos of the interior of North Ray, the TV record following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1665953" target="new" target="alsj">166:59:53</a> suggests he is actually west of the Rover.]
166:57:25||alsj|Fendell finds John again.
166:57:51||alsj|John turns and looks back toward the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
166:57:57||alsj|John hasn't seen the bag dispenser yet but starts back toward the Rover, retracing his steps.]</i></blockquote>
166:57:57||alsj|Charlie is using his own camera and the first pan  ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan17239-48SBHR.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.6 Mb</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan17239-48SB.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">160k</a> ) consists of frames AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17239" target="new" target="alsj">17239</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17248" target="new" target="alsj">17248</a>.  He started by aiming at the right side of the crater and turned to his left between frames.  According to Manned Spacecraft Center Document MSC-07252, &quot;Apollo 16: Index of 70-mm Photographs and 16-mm Film Strips&quot;, this Right filter setting gives images in horizontally-polarized light.]
166:57:57||alsj|The second pan ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan17249-62SBHR.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4.6 Mb</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan17249-62SB.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">176k</a> ) consists of frames AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17249" target="new" target="alsj">17249</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17262" target="new" target="alsj">17262</a> and the polarization is 45 degrees from horizontal.]</i></blockquote>
166:58:31||alsj|John gets into position to grab the bags and drops to his knees.  It takes an extra second or so for him to actually grab the bags and, in that second, he starts to lose his balance and, as he rises, he pitches forward onto his hands and knees.
166:58:31||alsj|Charlie's third pan ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan17263-76SBHR.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">4.6 Mb</a> or <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan17263-76SB.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">176k</a> ) consists of frames AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17263" target="new" target="alsj">17263</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17277" target="new" target="alsj">17277</a>.  The Left filter setting gives images in vertically-polarized light.]</i></blockquote>
166:58:40||alsj|John has the SCB in his left hand and the bag dispenser in his right.  The most effective technique for getting up from your hands and knees while wearing the Apollo suit on the Moon is to push up and back, forcing your torso and backpack to rotate backwards over the knees and, then once your center of mass is over your feet, jumping up to your feet.  John doesn't try this but, instead, gets all of his weight on his left foreleg and then lifts his right hand and then his right knee off the ground.  He then pushes up with his left hand, brings his right foot forward a few inches and pushes up and forward with it enough that he starts to rise, and then runs forward to regain his balance.  He then heads for the Rover.
166:59:09||alsj|Tony is probably looking at one of several fist-sized rocks near the place where John fell.
166:59:13||alsj|John turned to his right to look back to where he fell and now finishes a complete revolution and heads for the Rover.  He goes off-camera to the left and Fendell pans to follow him.
166:59:34||alsj|Charlie is asking if Houston wants him to move far enough away from the first position that the combination of the two sets of pans will give good stereo of the far wall of the crater.  Our eyes are about 7.5 cm apart and, if the near field-of-view where we get good stereo extends to about one meter range, to get good photographic stereo of the far crater wall, which is about 1000 meters away, Charlie will have to move about 75 meters.
166:59:52||alsj|John crosses the TV field-of-view from left to right.  He is wearing his camera.  As Fendell continues to pan left, Charlie comes into view, running back to the Rover from the west.  This suggests that he did not take the polarimetry pans from the position indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  Charlie goes off-camera to the left, probably to get the 500-mm camera off John's seat.  Fendell pans right.]</i></blockquote>
167:00:25||alsj|Fendell finds John, who is running in the general direction of House Rock, and zooms in on him.
167:01:10||alsj|John stops and turns to look back at the Rover to judge his distance.  In the TV, it looks like he is close to House Rock but, as shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, he is only about halfway there.  He is near the location marked by the triangle labeled &quot;right polarization pan&quot;, which is about 65 meters from the Rover.  The run took about 85 seconds and John's average speed was a leisurely 2.7 km/hr.
167:01:33||alsj|Charlie briefly comes into view, carrying the scoop.  John is looking around the area where he stopped.  We don't know exactly when Charlie left the Rover and, so, can't time his run with any accuracy.]</i></blockquote>
167:01:33||alsj|As shown in Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-5a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-5a</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-5b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-5b</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission Report, John's heart rate has risen to about 105 beats per minute during the run while Charlie's is about 90.]
167:01:33||alsj|Charlie is back in the TV field-of-view, still running toward John.  John drops the SCB so it can serve as a scale in the documentary photos.]</i></blockquote>
167:02:02||alsj|Charlie arrives at the sample site and plants the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
167:02:29||alsj|Charlie goes behind John, headed closer to North Ray to take the second set of polarization pans.]</i></blockquote>
167:02:43||alsj|Charlie has stopped to look at the crater and, probably, at the Rover to judge his distance.]</i></blockquote>
167:02:46||alsj|Charlie turns and moves several meters farther from the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
167:02:49||alsj|John takes a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;, AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18615" target="new" target="alsj">18615</a>, of his first documented sample.]</i></blockquote>
167:02:49||alsj|John moves around the sample and takes a cross-Sun stereopair from the north, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18616" target="new" target="alsj">18616</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18617" target="new" target="alsj">18617</a>, stepping to his right between frames.]</i></blockquote>
167:03:15||alsj|Here, Charlie means that he is standing counterclockwise around the rim from the Left position.  The polarizing filter is still in its Left position, which means vertical polarization.
167:03:17||alsj|The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1670317.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">first pan</a> consists of frames AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17278" target="new" target="alsj">17278</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17289" target="new" target="alsj">17289</a>.  The Left filter position gives vertically-polarized images.]
167:03:17||alsj|John gets into position and bobs down to grab the sample in his right hand.  Evidently, it starts to crumble as he squeezes it.  This is sample 67055,  a 222 gram breccia.
167:03:17||alsj|John bags the sample and spins the bag to close it.  He spins the bag so hard that, after wrapping around itself several times, it reverses direction and starts to come open.  John spins the bag a second time and then seals it.  He then leans to his right and picks up the SCB. Because this is a new bag and is still flattened,  John pulls it into shape, opens the top, sticks his hand deep into the SCB to complete the shaping, and then stows the sample.]
167:03:17|Jones|alsj|At this point, John's sampling by hand, using his bobbing technique and not bothering with shovels and scoops and tongs...&quot;]
167:03:17|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  And we've been there twenty minutes and we('ve only) got two rocks.  There was a lot of wasted time up there, I thought.&quot;]
167:03:17|Jones|alsj|In overhead and on photography?
167:03:17|Duke|alsj|Well, I don't know what the polarimetry and all that stuff did for 'em.&quot;]
167:03:17|Jones|alsj|Whereas, the two of you sampling together with the tools could have gotten a lot of samples.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

Photographically, this is probably the best of the polarimetry pans.]
167:03:17||alsj|John puts the SCB down on the ground with care so it stands upright.]</i></blockquote>
167:05:23||alsj|Charlie moves downslope a few meters, moving away from us and to our left.  John takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18618" target="new" target="alsj">18618</a>.]
167:05:23|Jones|alsj|Just a thought here.  They were still looking for volcanics; so they were probably hoping for a repeat, I would imagine, of the layering (resulting from a series of lava flows) that Dave and Jim photographed at Hadley Rille.&quot;]
167:05:23|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  Yeah; we didn't have any of that.  We just didn't have any.  There were some rocks on that far rim over there, but I don't think it was bedrock.  As it was, it was all jumbled up; it didn't look like it was layering.&quot;]
167:05:23|Jones|alsj|But I betcha that's why they were so interested in the photography.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
167:05:40||alsj|John's sample-bag dispenser has come off again.  He gets into position to bob down to get it but, this time, goes down slowly and retrieves it without difficulty.]</i></blockquote>
167:06:04||alsj|At the left side of the TV picture we can see Charlie taking 500-mm photos.]</i></blockquote>

167:06:37||alsj|John gives up trying to re-attach the sample bag dispenser and, with the dispenser in his left hand, grabs the scoop in his right.]</i></blockquote>
167:06:37||alsj|John moves a couple of meters west of his first sample and starts digging a shallow, one-handed trench.  He is probably looking for a buried layer of white soil like the one they found at Plum Crater.]</i></blockquote>
167:07:17||alsj|John plants the scoop.  Charlie turns and comes upslope.]
167:07:17||alsj|Charlie's 500-mm photos of the interior of North Ray Crater are AS16-105-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17216" target="new" target="alsj">17216</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17235" target="new" target="alsj">17235</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:07:40||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right.
167:07:59||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie about 8 to 10 meters east of John.  House Rock is in the background.]</i></blockquote>
167:07:59||alsj|Charlie puts the SCB down on the ground and tries to stand it upright, but the weight of the 500-mm camera makes it fall over.  In Houston, there is a discussion about having Charlie take the film magazine out of his Hasselblad and putting it in the 500-mm camera.
167:08:37||alsj|While Charlie removes the filter, back in Houston Tony makes the decision to abandon the 500-mm photography and preserve the remaining film for sampling.
167:09:54||alsj|John is talking about an Apollo 15 sample which, obviously, he and Tony examined in the Lunar Receiving Lab at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.  The sample in question may be 15455, a large sample Dave Scott collected at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.spur.html#1454801" target="new" target="alsj">Spur Crater</a>.
167:09:54|Duke|alsj|If I had it to do over again, I don't think we ought to sit there and try to describe rocks to 'em.  I think you just ought to collect rocks.  They have to trust you. See, John's sitting there wasting time trying to describe this rock to 'em.  And he could have just bagged the rock, put it in his box, and gone got another one that was different from that.  And he could have just said, you know, this is a white rock or a breccia.  You know, just a brief description of the rock.  I think all of the flights wasted a lot of time doing that.  We could have done a lot more geology, I think, if we hadn't wasting time describing rocks.  In the future, I think it's going to be important - you know, the long stays on the Moon - that we do it.  (That) we don't try to describe back to mission control.  Be well enough trained geologists to just pick it up; and they just trust you with that.
167:09:54|Jones|alsj|Especially on this third EVA.  On the first one, where you were finding stuff that was very different from what the geologists expected, I suppose an argument could be made that they needed to know that you weren't finding basalts.&quot;]
167:09:54|Duke|alsj|To me, just looking at this TV, they could see the distinct rock types.  There were white ones and the gray one and the black ones.  And then just go collect every one of those, you see.  And then they can write their description done when they get them into the labs.&quot;]
167:09:54||alsj|John has taken four &quot;before&quot; photos of this rock.  AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18619" target="new" target="alsj">18619</a> and  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18620" target="new" target="alsj">18620</a> are a down-Sun stereopair and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18621" target="new" target="alsj">18621</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18622" target="new" target="alsj">18622</a> are a cross-Sun stereopair from the north.]
167:09:54||alsj|Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes that future astronauts will probably be equipped with helmet-mounted, miniature cameras which would relay high-quality images back to Earth or the base camp.  This would reduce the need for verbal descriptions although, obviously, the astronaut would still need to describe any striking features or samples for immediate consideration by support personnel.]</i></blockquote>
167:09:57||alsj|Charlie finally gets the filter off his Hasselblad and then turns to his right and goes to join John.  Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>
167:10:08||alsj|Fendell finds John, who has the sample in hand for examination.  This is 67015, a 1.2 kg breccia which is shown in Figures 59A and 59B in the Professional Paper.   While John examines the sample, Charlie gets the scoop, which John had planted to provide scale in his &quot;before&quot; photos.  Charlie returns to the sample site 8-10 meters east of John.]</i></blockquote>
167:10:36||alsj|John puts 67015 in the SCB he had previously put on the ground.  Fendell pans right to watch Charlie.
167:10:46||alsj|John's &quot;after&quot;  of 67015 is AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18623" target="new" target="alsj">18623</a>.]
167:10:46||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop and takes a stereopair of &quot;befores&quot;, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17318" target="new" target="alsj">17318</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17319" target="new" target="alsj">17319</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:11:19||alsj|Charlie gets the scoop under the sample and raises it far enough so he can grab it in his right hand.  During John's next transmission, Charlie hops back and then scoops up another small sample.]</i></blockquote>
167:11:25||alsj|Fendell pans left to find John, overshoots, and then finds him as he takes a down-Sun stereopair, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18624" target="new" target="alsj">18624</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18625" target="new" target="alsj">18625</a>.  John then moves around to the north to get a cross-Sun stereopair.]</i></blockquote>
167:12:19||alsj|Charlie tries to get a sample bag off the bunch that John has hooked over his little finger.]</i></blockquote>
167:12:42||alsj|This is sample 67075, which consists of two pieces of &quot;fragile white breccia&quot; which broke into more pieces during transport to Earth.  See Figures 64A and 64B in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>
167:12:43||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right to get the SCB that contains the 500-mm camera.]</i></blockquote>
167:12:50||alsj|John gets into position to plant the scoop in the secondary crater.  It takes a couple of tries before he gets it stable.]</i></blockquote>
167:13:07|Jones|alsj|In the other places, the soil was deep enough that you could stick the scoop far enough in that it would stay upright.&quot;]
167:13:07|Duke|alsj|And it wouldn't (have to) be quite vertical (to stay upright).&quot;]
167:13:07||alsj|John's cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;befores&quot; is  AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18626" target="new" target="alsj">18626</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18627" target="new" target="alsj">18627</a>.  He gets the scoop so he can collect some small samples.
167:13:07||alsj|Off-camera, Charlie is probably trying to retrieve the SCB and may have fallen.
167:13:07||alsj|In Houston, Tony asks if Experiments wants Charlie to get the rake while he is at the Rover and take it out where John is working. Experiments decides that they want the rake sample taken near the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
167:13:49||alsj|John is collecting samples out of the secondary and is holding a sample bag in his left hand and has the scoop in his right. Charlie comes into view, carrying the SCB.]</i></blockquote>
167:14:25||alsj|John plants the scoop and takes the sample bag to his SCB.  Fendell follows.  This sample is 67095, a 340 gram &quot;light gray rock with black glass and white clasts&quot;.  See Figures 65A and 65B in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>
167:14:39||alsj|After stowing bag 385, John goes back to the secondary, grabs the scoop, and slides it under the next sample he wants to collect.]</i></blockquote>
167:15:03||alsj|John lifts the sample.  The TV image is not very clear, but it looks like he drops the sample as he tries to grab it with his left hand.]</i></blockquote>
167:15:24||alsj|John gets the scoop under the rock again.
167:15:30||alsj|John gets a grip on the rock this time and then pulls a bag off the pack he has hooked to the little finger on his left hand.]</i></blockquote>
167:15:56||alsj|This is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16Samp67115.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">sample 67115</a>, a 240-gram breccia.
167:16:01||alsj|Charlie has probably removed the film magazine from the 500-mm camera and has stowed both the magazine and the camera under John's seat.]
167:16:01||alsj|John spins the bag, seals it, and then gets into position to take a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; from the north, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18628" target="new" target="alsj">18628</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:16:16||alsj|John grabs the scoop and heads from his SCB.  He stops and looks toward House Rock.]</i></blockquote>
167:17:01||alsj|After taking a moment's rest, John stows the sample in the SCB, picks up the SCB and heads back toward the Rover.  Fendell pans left to find Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
167:17:32||alsj|The actual distance from the Rover to House Rock is about 220m.
167:17:32||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie just as he discards an empty sample bag dispenser.  Charlie is west of the Rover at the location marked &quot;67435&quot; in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  The largest of the white boulders is 30 meters beyond him.]</i></blockquote>
167:18:11||alsj|This is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16Sample67435.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">sample 67435</a>, a 354-gram, glass-coated breccia which is shown in Figures 26A, 26B, and 26C on page 70 in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16PP-D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Section D2</a> in the Professional Paper.
167:18:11||alsj|Charlie plants the tongs he is carrying, spins the bag and seals it; and then takes an &quot;after&quot;, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17322" target="new" target="alsj">17322</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:18:51||alsj|Charlie has an SCB standing upright next to him.  It no longer has the 500-mm camera in it.  He picks up the SCB and takes a couple of small steps to regain his balance after reaching down.  He seals bag 415 and stows it.
167:19:01||alsj|Charlie grabs the tongs and heads for the large white boulder shown just east of the &quot;67415&quot; sample location in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  John arrives back at the Rover. The 75-m trip from his sampling area took about 2 minutes and his average speed was only 2.3 km/hr, probably because he stopped to looked back at House Rock to estimate its distance from the Rover at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1671738" target="new" target="alsj">167:17:38</a>.]</i></blockquote>
167:19:01||alsj|Charlie has stopped on a small rise a few meters short of the boulder and, after adjusting his camera settings, takes AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17323" target="new" target="alsj">17323</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17324" target="new" target="alsj">17324</a>, turning to his right between frames.]</i></blockquote>
167:19:37||alsj|Charlie moves closer to the boulder, making seven skipping strides before he stops.
167:19:37|Jones|alsj|When you say 'it's hot out here', is there some specific thing you were talking about?
167:19:37|Duke|alsj|I was running more in  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new" target="alsj">Intermediate (cooling)</a>; and I could feel a hot spot...The right (side) PLSS strap was tight, compressing the insulation in the suit, and I could feel the Sun in there.  With the higher angle, we were running mostly in Intermediate, here.&quot;]
167:19:37||alsj|The current time is 1714 UTC on 23 April 1972.  The Sun's elevation is 46.3 degrees.  On Apollo 15 and 17, the solar elevations at the end of EVA-3 were 40.2 and 40.5, respectively.  At the end of Apollo 16 EVA-3, it will be nearly 48.2 degrees.
167:19:37||alsj|A search of the EVA-3 transcript indicates that, of the 5 hour 40 minute EVA, Charlie used cooling settings above Minimum - but probably not above Intermediate - for about 3 hours 33 minutes. About 26 minutes of that was here at Station 11 and the remainder began soon after they arrived at Station 13 (Shadow Rock) and continued to the end of the EVA. </i></blockquote>
167:19:37||alsj|Charlie takes AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17325" target="new" target="alsj">17325</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17326" target="new" target="alsj">17326</a>, again turning to his right between frames.  He then takes four more short skipping strides and gets to the base of what looks like a foot-high fillet at the base of the boulder.  David Harland has assembled the two frames into a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.1671954_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">mini-pan</a>.]</i></blockquote>
167:20:11||alsj|It is probably during this interval that John takes  a cross-Sun stereopair from the south, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18629" target="new" target="alsj">18629</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18630" target="new" target="alsj">18630</a>, stepping to his left between frames.  He then takes a down-Sun, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18631" target="new" target="alsj">18631</a>.]
167:20:11||alsj|The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_Basin" target="new" target="alsj">Sudbury Basin</a> in Ontario, Canada is one of the largest impact craters known on Earth.  The Apollo 16 (7-9 July 1971) and Apollo 17 (24-25 May 1972) crews each <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap-geotrips.html" target="new" target="alsj">trained</a> at Sudbury a few months before their respective missions.  Six photos from the Apollo 16 visit can be found in the Apollo 16 Image Library, beginning with <a href="images16.html#S7139828" target="new" target="alsj">S71-39828</a>.
167:20:38||alsj|Using the tongs to gauge his distance and provide scale, Charlie takes close-ups AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17327" target="new" target="alsj">17327</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17328" target="new" target="alsj">17328</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17329" target="new" target="alsj">17329</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17330" target="new" target="alsj">17330</a>.  John is still at the Rover, just off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>
167:20:51||alsj|Charlie has the tongs in his left hand, a bunch of sample bags hooked onto the little finger of his right hand, and is holding the SCB in his right hand.  As he works the camera trigger with his right hand, he drops the SCB.
167:21:11||alsj|Charlie gets into a small crater north of the SCB and drops his left knee onto the crater rim and easily retrieves the bag.]</i></blockquote>
167:21:20||alsj|Charlie turns to his right and moves off-camera to the right to examine the westernmost of the large white boulders.  Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>
167:21:40||alsj|As Charlie approaches the largest of the white boulders, we see a very large fragment sitting on the top  It is at least a meter long and perhaps a half meter thick.   There is a visible fracture that separates at least part of this fragment from the bulk of the boulder.  The presence of the fracture should make it relatively easy to break off a piece.]</i></blockquote>
167:21:48||alsj|Charlie reaches the boulder and stands facing the large fragment.
167:22:07||alsj|Charlie leans back to raise his aim and takes  AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17331" target="new" target="alsj">17331</a>.  He then steps to his left and takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17332" target="new" target="alsj">17332</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:22:27||alsj|John comes into view, running out to join Charlie and carrying the rake.  There are several small pieces of rock on top of the boulder and Charlie takes one for examination.  John goes over a small ridge and nearly disappears as he runs down into a depression between the ridge and the boulder.
167:22:30||alsj|In NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#S7158014" target="new" target="alsj">S71-15801</a>, Dr. Fred H&ouml;rz an impact mechanics expert at MSC, is shown with back-up LMP Ed Mitchell (left), John Young, and Charlie Duke at the Lunar Receiving Lab.

167:22:30||alsj|This is sample 67455, a 942-gram breccia which is shown in Figures 71A and 71B in the Professional Paper.  This sample broke sometime before it was first examined in the Lunar Receiving Lab in Houston.]
167:22:30||alsj|John has reached the boulder.  It appears that Charlie is standing partway up the fillet.  John stays below him and moves out of sight to the left, behind the foreground boulder.]</i></blockquote>
167:23:31|Duke|alsj|Fred H&ouml;rz gave us a briefing about shocked rocks, about the various phases that they metamorphose through.  I don't remember much about the details, but he was very good.  And I think he talked about the zap pits and those things that you see in impacts that just changes the whole character of the rock.  He's a German (and has a) Ph.D.  He's still at NASA, as a matter of fact.  His specialty, I think, was shocked rocks.&quot;]
167:23:31||alsj|Charlie turns to face John, comes part way down the fillet, and leans to his left to pick up the SCB he's been carrying everywhere.]</i></blockquote>
167:23:35||alsj|John turns to present the left side of his PLSS which, normally, has an SCB mounted on it.  During the following exchange, John's transmissions are badly clipped.]</i></blockquote>
167:23:51||alsj|Charlie puts bag 416 in the SCB he is carrying.]</i></blockquote>

167:24:19||alsj|John raises the rake and pours.
167:24:27||alsj|Charlie spins the bag closed.

167:24:43||alsj|Charlie's cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; is AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17335" target="new" target="alsj">17335</a>.  He is mostly hidden by the foreground boulder and, once he takes the &quot;after&quot; he hops sideways up slope behind the foreground boulder, moving generally toward the Rover and trying to get high enough that he can get a &quot;locator&quot; showing House Rock.]</i></blockquote>
167:25:03||alsj|Charlie continues upslope behind the foreground boulder and stops when he  is high enough that we can see his Hasselblad.  He faces House Rock and takes AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17336" target="new" target="alsj">17336</a>.]</i></blockquote>
167:25:09||alsj|Charlie turns to examine the north side of the foreground boulder.
167:25:29||alsj|John grabs the tongs and Charlie joins him.  John moves a couple of meters toward the Rover.  Charlie climbs the fillet and rests his SCB against the boulder.]</i></blockquote>
167:26:05||alsj|John moves out of sight behind the foreground boulder and takes a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18634" target="new" target="alsj">18634</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18635" target="new" target="alsj">18635</a>, of another sample.]</i></blockquote>
167:26:22||alsj|John takes a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18636" target="new" target="alsj">18636</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:26:24||alsj|A soil sample from a permanently shadowed area would not receive direct exposure to the solar wind and to solar cosmic rays.  Such a soil sample might show differences in the relative abundances of volatile components, although such differences would be better preserved if the sample had the vacuum protection provided by the Special Environmental Sample Container.  Here, Houston is more concerned with time than the extra protection afforded by the SESC.
167:26:24||alsj|Still standing at the top of the fillet with his back to us, Charlie examines the black clast.  This is sample 67475 ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/S72-43363.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">343k</a> ), a 175-gram, aphanitic, black clast.]</i></blockquote>
167:26:24||alsj|Charlie's &quot;after&quot; is AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17337" target="new" target="alsj">17337</a>.  He did not take a &quot;before&quot;.]
167:26:24||alsj|John goes out of sight behind the foreground boulder and may be collecting his sample.]
167:26:24||alsj|Charlie gets a sample bag off his little finger and bags the black clast.]</i></blockquote>
167:27:15||alsj|Charlie reaches down and stows the hammer in the pocket that is strapped to his right shin.
167:27:15|Jones|alsj|Had you spent much time at the (Lunar) Receiving Lab.&quot;]
167:27:15|Duke|alsj|We did some; but not much.  We had some briefings about the rocks  from some of the geologists; we saw some slides and stuff like that.  But I don't remember actually going over there and looking at very many of them.  We did (look at) a few (rocks from prior missions), though.  We probably visited four times, for all the mission, but we didn't spend hours.
167:27:15|Jones|alsj|Did you go in groups?
167:27:15|Duke|alsj|Me and John, and maybe the backup crew.  I don't remember.  At this point, our classroom stuff was mostly about our (Apollo 16) geology and our area and the experiments we would be doing and the science behind all of the experiments on the ALSEP we were going to have.  So we didn't really get much out that wasn't directly related.&quot;]
167:27:15||alsj|During John's next transmission, Charlie spins the sample bag closed and then gets the SCB that he leaned against the boulder at the top of the fillet.
167:27:52||alsj|Charlie stows the black clast in the SCB, hops down the fillet and then turns to watch John.
167:27:52||alsj|John's sample is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LunarSampleCompendium67415.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">67415</a>, a 175-gram, white-matrix breccia.  His second thought was the right one.
167:28:25||alsj|John stows the white-matrix breccia in the SCB Charlie is carrying and then gets the rake.
167:28:51||alsj|John is pointing at an area between the foreground ridge and the largest boulder.  They are working down-Sun of the Rover and the scene is noticeably washed out.  The TV camera lens may also be dirty.
167:28:53||alsj|Charlie is probably suggesting that they put the tongs in the &quot;before&quot; pictures.
167:29:08||alsj|Charlie has probably dropped the pack of sample bags he had hooked on his little finger.  He retrieves them with the tongs while John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;befores&quot; from the south, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18637" target="new" target="alsj">18637</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18638" target="new" target="alsj">18638</a>.]
167:29:08|Jones|alsj|I gather that you'd planned to sample independently at most of the stops.
167:29:08|Duke|alsj|Here, we were supposed to go out independently.  That was the plan.  But the bags were falling off and we figured out, like John said earlier (at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1672101" target="new" target="alsj">167:21:01</a>), that we'd better do it together because we were just having a lot of equipment problems.  I think we got a little bit more efficient when we started working together.  But, you know, if you had good equipment, you could have done it all by ourselves.
167:29:08|Jones|alsj|Now, when you were solo sampling, you were planning on taking an SCB out and setting it on the ground next to you?
167:29:08|Duke|alsj|Well, that's what we ended up doing, 'cause we wouldn't have had any place to put 'em.
167:29:08|Jones|alsj|And you'd planned ahead to do that?
167:29:08|Duke|alsj|Yeah.
167:29:08||alsj|While Charlie gets a bag ready, John gets a soil sample with the rake.]</i></blockquote>
167:29:43||alsj|Charlie holds the bag down and John pours.]</i></blockquote>
167:29:55||alsj|John has collected more soil and pours it into the bag.]</i></blockquote>
167:29:56||alsj|Charlie spins the bag closed and John backs up to take an &quot;after&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18639" target="new" target="alsj">18639</a>.  The 249-gram soil sample (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LunarSampleCompendium67481.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">67481</a>) was taken just to the right of  the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
167:30:10||alsj|John starts raking.
167:30:11||alsj|Charlie watches John shake the soil out of the rake.]</i></blockquote>
167:30:18||alsj|While Charlie gets a bag ready, John does two more swaths.
167:30:33||alsj|Charlie holds the bag low and John pours the rocks into the bag.  The fragments are shown in Figures 74A to 74G in the Professional Paper.
167:30:48||alsj|While Charlie spins the bag closed, John backs up and takes an &quot;after&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18640" target="new" target="alsj">18640</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:30:51||alsj|John picks up the SCB.
167:31:02||alsj|Charlie puts sample bag 420 in the SCB, which John is now holding at waist height.
167:31:08||alsj|They drop something.
167:31:12||alsj|Charlie gets the tongs.
167:31:17||alsj|John starts running toward the Rover and, after a few seconds, Charlie follows.  They take a circuitous route to avoid the intervening ridge and probably, a crater which is hidden from our view.]</i></blockquote>
167:32:13||alsj|The &quot;bag shoe&quot; may be the &quot;metal strap on rear side of bag&quot; indicated in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-62.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">14-62</a> in the Apollo 16 Mission Report.]
167:32:13||alsj|John and Charlie stop to do a second rake sample.  They are near the rake sample site marked &quot;67610&quot; in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the Preliminary Science Report and are partially obscured by the high-gain antenna mast.]</i></blockquote>
167:32:29||alsj|Charlie plants the tongs and backs off to the north to take a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;.  John is at the left side of the picture, holding the rake.]
167:32:29||alsj|John runs around the tongs to look at the left side of Charlie's PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
167:32:41||alsj|Charlie turns a few degrees to his right to give John a better view.]</i></blockquote>
167:32:46||alsj|The following dialog indicates that John thinks that Tony has been talking about the sample bag dispenser and not the SCB.  He adjusts the sample bags on the fingers of his left hand.
167:32:49||alsj|Stops to listen
167:33:05||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun &quot;before&quot; is  AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17338" target="new" target="alsj">17338</a> and John's cross-Sun stereopair from the south is AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18641" target="new" target="alsj">18641</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18642" target="new" target="alsj">18642</a>.  In the TV picture, note that Charlie has an SCB and a pack of sample bags in his right hand and has an SCB mounted on the left side of his PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
167:33:30||alsj|John does a swath with the rake.
167:33:38||alsj|Charlie moves counter-clockwise around the rake site and takes up a position north of John.  John does a second swath.]</i></blockquote>
167:33:40||alsj|John starts a third swath.
167:33:52||alsj|John isn't sure he has collected anything but soil and soil clods.]</i></blockquote>
167:33:54||alsj|John starts to shake the dirt out of the rake.]</i></blockquote>
167:33:57||alsj|John is using an unusual pouring technique.  He had the rake handle in his left hand and raised the rake until he could grab the handle with his right hand just above the rake head.  He then lowered his right hand until the rake handle was parallel to the ground and, now, with Charlie holding a bag at about waist height, John rotates the rake to get the rock fragments to pour into the bag.]</i></blockquote>
167:34:17||alsj|While Charlie spins the bag closed, seals it, and stows it in the SCB he's carrying, John backs up to get a soil sample with the rake.]</i></blockquote>
167:34:41||alsj|Charlie gets a sample bag ready for the soil sample and then sets the SCB down on the ground to his right.  The ground there is a little higher than where he is standing and, because he doesn't have to bend his knees while he is getting the SCB placed, he has no trouble getting it to stand upright. The sample is <a hret="<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/LunarSampleCompendium67601.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">67600</a>.]</i></blockquote>
167:35:01|Jones|alsj|You talked about the shopping bag in </i>Moonwalker<i>, I think.  You wanted to get a bag with a big enough bottom...&quot;]
167:35:01|Duke|alsj|Just like a shopping bag.  You know, like you get to put your Christmas presents in.   It would have a handle so that, when you pick it up, it closes up and, when you let it back down, it opens up and, so, you can just drop your samples into 'em.  It would come up to about mid-thigh level; and you could just pick it up and off you'd go with it.&quot;]
167:35:01|Jones|alsj|Was it a last minute idea before the flight.
167:35:01|Duke|alsj|Oh, we thought about it earlier, but they didn't pay any attention to us.  But it would have worked.&quot;]
167:35:01||alsj|John and Charlie discuss the shopping bag concept again at Shadow Rock at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta13.html#1683352" target="new" target="alsj">168:33:52</a>.]
167:35:01||alsj|John raises the rake, Charlie lowers the sample bag, and John starts the pour.]</i></blockquote>
167:35:30||alsj|Charlie grabs the top of the SCB and gets it open so he can drop the sample bag in.  He then picks up the SCB.  John has backed off-camera to the left and takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18643" target="new" target="alsj">18643</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:35:38||alsj|Charlie gets the tongs from John and goes off-camera to the right, around a large, foreground boulder, while John heads directly for the Rover.
167:36:03||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom and pans right.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:10||alsj|Charlie crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left, headed for the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:21||alsj|John is saying that things are always farther away than they seem and that trips take longer than he expects.  Because there is no atmospheric haze to give an impression of distance, it is very difficult to judge the size and distance of distant objects.]
167:36:21||alsj|In 1835, Charles Darwin had a similar problem judging distances while traveling in the Andes east of Santiago, Chile, in March 1835:  &quot;Travelers having observed the difficulty of judging heights and distances amidst lofty mountains, have generally attributed it to the absence of objects of comparison. It appears to me, that it is fully as much owing to the transparency of the air confounding objects at different distances, and likewise partly to the novelty of an unusual degree of fatigue arising from a little exertion,&mdash;habit being thus opposed to the evidence of the senses. I am sure that this extreme clearness of the air gives a peculiar character to the landscape, all objects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane, as in a drawing or panorama. The transparency is, I presume, owing to the equable and high state of atmospheric dryness.&quot; - from The Voyage of the Beagle, p 347.
167:36:21||alsj|Fendell stops the pan to give the Backroom another look into North Ray while he waits for John and Charlie to leave the Rover.]
167:36:21||alsj|House Rock can be seen at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CZ.2/80.6</a> in the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-III 3 of 3</a>&quot; map in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.

At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta11.html#1671738" target="new" target="alsj">167:17:38</a>, John only slightly underestimated the distance of House Rock from the Rover as being 150 meters.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:23||alsj|Charlie crosses the TV field-of-view from left to right, carrying the tongs.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:30||alsj|Charlie stops to do a rough sample bag count.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:39||alsj|Charlie starts running toward House Rock.  Fendell pans right to follow but cannot pan fast enough to keep him in view.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:45||alsj|John comes into view, carrying the rake.  He does a couple of two-footed hops as he gets up to speed.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:48||alsj|Fendell finally gets both John and Charlie in view and gets a very nice sequence of both of them running at speed.  They are both using the loping, foot-to-foot stride.]</i></blockquote>
167:36:57||alsj|Charlie stops at the location marked &quot;area of 67710 (rake)&quot; in figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  He is about 56 meters from the TV camera and the run took about 32 seconds.  His average speed was about 6.3 km/hr.  Only <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a15/a15.spur.html#1455628" target="new" target="alsj">Dave Scott's 7.0 km/hr run</a> back to the Rover from the Station 7 boulder was faster.]
167:36:57||alsj|Charlie plants the tongs to serve as a gnomon.  John arrives at the sampling site.  The trip took him about 41 seconds and his average speed was 4.9 km/hr.  After he stops, John looks toward House Rock.]</i></blockquote>
167:37:33||alsj|John backs up to take a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18644" target="new" target="alsj">18644</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18645" target="new" target="alsj">18645</a>.  Charlie goes around the tongs to the north to get into position to take a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
167:37:35||alsj|John moves in to get the sample.
167:37:35||alsj|Charlie takes the down-Sun, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17339" target="new" target="alsj">17339</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:37:55||alsj|Cross-Sun pictures show far greater detail than down-Suns, but down-Suns can provide fully lit images of the color/gray-scale on the gnomon so that the true color and albedo of the rocks can be determined.  John and Charlie have not been using the broken gnomon but, it is probably at this moment that someone in Houston realizes that the color/gray-scale can still be used.  Tony will make the suggestion at  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta13.html#1682318" target="new" target="alsj">168:23:18</a> at the start of the Station 13 activities.  My thanks to Brian Lawrence calling my attention to this point.]
167:37:55||alsj|John steps forward with the rake and Charlie takes up a position north of him and takes a &quot;locator&quot;, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17340" target="new" target="alsj">17340</a>.  As shown in the picture, John is standing with his knees slightly bent and the rake in his right hand.  He starts each swath by dropping the tines onto the surface slightly behind his right leg and then dragging the rake forward a half meter or so.  He does three swaths, shaking some of the dirt out after each one.  Charlie has a sample bag ready.]</i></blockquote>
167:38:34||alsj|John raises the rake and steps toward Charlie to do the pour.
167:38:51||alsj|Charlie spins the bag to close it.
167:38:57||alsj|Charlie looks around for the hand-carried SCB.  Once he realizes he doesn't have it anymore, he hands bag 423 to John and turns to present his SCB.  John gives him the rake and stows the sample bag.]</i></blockquote>
167:39:09||alsj|John gets into position to take a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; from the south, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18646" target="new" target="alsj">18646</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:39:15||alsj|Charlie steps in to get a soil sample with the rake.]</i></blockquote>
167:39:35||alsj|After three attempts, Charlie doesn't have enough soil to do a pour.]</i></blockquote>
167:39:42||alsj|John steps back a meter or so and kicks the soil to see what he might find.  Evidently, he is standing on a thicker soil patch. Charlie finally gets enough of a sample to do a pour and steps toward John, who gets a bag out.]</i></blockquote>
167:39:56||alsj|Charlie does the pour.
167:39:59||alsj|John backs up and Charlie gets a soil sample from the place where John was standing.]</i></blockquote>
167:39:59||alsj|Charlie raises the rake and pours some soil into the bag.]</i></blockquote>
167:40:23||alsj|Charlie gets some more soil.
167:40:42||alsj|John spins the bag closed and Charlie presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
167:40:47||alsj|John stows the sample bag in Charlie's SCB.]</i></blockquote>
167:40:50||alsj|Charlie starts running toward House Rock while John grabs the tongs and follows.]</i></blockquote>
167:41:14||alsj|Charlie reaches a slope change and begins to go downslope toward House Rock.  John stops and looks at a partially buried boulder which is just east of their path.]</i></blockquote>
167:41:59||alsj|Charlie stops  and looks up at House Rock.  He is probably near the large fragment known as Outhouse Rock, which is just south of the main boulder as shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the Preliminary Science Report.]</i></blockquote>
167:42:14||alsj|John reaches the southern face of Outhouse Rock.]</i></blockquote>
167:42:26||alsj|Charlie goes around the east side of Outhouse Rock and John follows.]</i></blockquote>
167:42:57||alsj|Charlie is standing ten meters or so east of House Rock and has all but disappeared from view.  We get only an occasional glimpse of the top of his helmet and OPS.  John is still visible near the east side of the boulder but, because of his distance from the Rover, even at maximum zoom it is difficult to tell what he is doing.]</i></blockquote>
167:43:15||alsj|Charlie takes a sequence of four pictures of the base of House Rock, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17341" target="new" target="alsj">17341</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17342" target="new" target="alsj">17342</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17343" target="new" target="alsj">17343</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17344" target="new" target="alsj">17344</a>.  He turns slightly between frames, making the sequence a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-17341-4.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">partial pan</a>.]</i></blockquote>
167:43:36||alsj|John disappears behind Outhouse Rock.  He reappears briefly, probably having made his way around some boulders but then, as Charlie joins him, they both go out of sight.
167:44:39||alsj|Charlie's close-up of the shatter cone is AS16-106 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17345" target="new" target="alsj">17345</a>.

167:44:39||alsj|Fendell moves his aim to the right to get a full-frame view of House Rock at maximum zoom.  After several seconds, he moves the TV a short distance to the left and then moves it back to the direction where we last saw the crew.]</i></blockquote>

Note that Charlie has a pack of sample bags hooked to his little finger.]</i></blockquote>
167:46:00||alsj|We get a glimpse of the back of somebody's PLSS.]</i></blockquote>
167:46:22||alsj|These samples are <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16Samp67935.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">67935-37</a>, which have an aggregate weight of about 230 grams.

167:46:22||alsj|Fendell shifts his aim up to get a view of some of the boulders scattered on the flank of Smoky Mountain that forms the backdrop.  He then moves his aim up slope in steps until he is looking at the summit.]</i></blockquote>
167:46:53||alsj|At John's suggestion, Charlie is holding the sample in about it's original position.]</i></blockquote>
167:47:03||alsj|Fendell pans down to find John and Charlie.]</i></blockquote>
167:47:10||alsj|The &quot;after&quot; may be AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18652" target="new" target="alsj">18652</a>.]
167:47:10||alsj|This sample is 67915.  It weighs 2.5 kilograms and is shown in Figures 78A and 78B in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>
167:47:11||alsj|The tops of John and Charlie's EMUs come into view.]</i></blockquote>
167:47:24||alsj|Evidently, Charlie discards the sample bag and we see it pop into view.  The bag strikes the side of House Rock about four meters up and then falls to the ground behind Outhouse Rock.]</i></blockquote>
167:48:19||alsj|John's picture may be AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18653" target="new" target="alsj">18653</a>.]
167:48:19||alsj|Although the images are very small in a grainy scene, Charlie is facing left in our view and is evidently striking the rock at about chest height.  Motions of the hammer are visible and indicate that he raises the hammer to head height for each swing.
167:49:04||alsj|These samples are 67955, which have an aggregate weight of about 170 grams and are shown in Figures 80A to 80C in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>

167:50:11||alsj|Charlie is getting a soil sample from inside the split.]</i></blockquote>
167:51:19||alsj|John moves away from House Rock to the east.]</i></blockquote>
167:51:48||alsj|We can see Charlie step to his right between frames of the cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17347" target="new" target="alsj">17347</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17348" target="new" target="alsj">17348</a>.   These pictures give us a good view of John's sample bags.]</i></blockquote>
167:52:00||alsj|Charlie joins John but, even at maximum zoom, it is difficult to see who is doing what.  The following dialog indicates that, as usual, Charlie is using the rake and John is holding a sample bag open. As Charlie mentions in just a moment, there is very little soil at this location and Charlie is probably asking John if he can kick some soil loose.]</i></blockquote>
167:52:41||alsj|Charlie raises the rake and pours.
167:53:07||alsj|Charlie is describing  sample 67975, a 447-gram piece of glass-coated breccia which is shown in Figures 82A, 82B, and 82C in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>
167:53:38||alsj|John has a bag out and, after they put the glass-coated rock in it, Charlie turns to present his SCB.]</i></blockquote>
167:54:26||alsj|Charlie moves a short distance northeast and then turns and takes a second <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16-17349-54.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">portrait</a> of the base of House Rock consisting of frames AS16- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17349" target="new" target="alsj">17349</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17354" target="new" target="alsj">17354</a>.

167:54:26||alsj|In Houston, Jim Lovell, the spokesman for the Backroom, requests that the crew use the padded bags to return a sample of igneous rock, if they can quickly find anything they are sure is igneous. </i></blockquote>
167:55:08||alsj|Charlie joins John near the split.
167:55:18||alsj|Evidently, they dropped some of the sample bags and, in the process of retrieving them with the tongs, got them caught.]</i></blockquote>
167:55:31||alsj|Charlie heads for the Rover with John following.]</i></blockquote>
167:56:47||alsj|John has just called Charlie &quot;Tony&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
167:57:26||alsj|Charlie is carrying the rake.  John probably has the tongs.
167:57:32||alsj|Houston wants to use the padded bags for some very hard samples such as basalt.
167:58:07||alsj|John stops near the location marked &quot;67235&quot; in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-65.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-65</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>.]</i></blockquote>
167:58:10||alsj|Charlie used the foot-to-foot, loping stride all the way back to the Rover,   Making an allowance for the detours he had to make around boulders and craters near House Rock, he ran about 145 meters and made the trip in 2 minutes 40 seconds.  His average speed was 3.3 km/hr and the relatively slow pace was probably due to the fact that he was running upslope.  John also used the loping stride and covered about 115 meters before he stopped.  His average speed was about 2.6 km/hr.]
167:58:10||alsj|John takes a down-Sun stereopair of &quot;befores&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18654" target="new" target="alsj">18654</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18655" target="new" target="alsj">18655</a>.  Note that these pictures are taken in a direction at right angles to the line of footprints.]</i></blockquote>
167:58:31||alsj|John and Charlie's EVA-3 heart rates are shown in Figures <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-5a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-5a</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-5b.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">10-5b</a>, respectively, in the Mission Report.]
167:58:31||alsj|John hops around to the north and takes a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18656" target="new" target="alsj">18656</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18657" target="new" target="alsj">18657</a>.] </i></blockquote>
167:58:50||alsj|An Exer-Genie is a simple piece of exercise equipment, probably an elastic cord they could hook to their feet or to the Command Module bulkhead so they could stretch against resistance and get some exercise during the trip out from Earth.]</i></blockquote>
167:58:58||alsj|John takes a second cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;befores&quot; from the north, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18658" target="new" target="alsj">18658</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18659" target="new" target="alsj">18659</a>, and then a &quot;locator&quot; to the Rover, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18660" target="new" target="alsj">18660</a>.  Note that the absence of a gnomon makes it much more difficult to compare features in successive photographs.]</i></blockquote>
167:59:21||alsj|John steps forward and uses the tongs to collect sample 67235, a 938-gram dark-matrix breccia shown in Figures 67A, 67B, and 67C in the Professional Paper.  John raises the tongs so that the handle is lower than the head.]</i></blockquote>
167:59:31||alsj|John heads for the Rover.  As he gets close, we can see the rock still in the tongs.   Note that he did not take any &quot;afters&quot; of this sample.]</i></blockquote>
167:59:48||alsj|This is the caution flag which sits on the top of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Rover console</a> as shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">1-22</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../lrvhand.html" target="new" target="alsj">LRV Operations Handbook</a>.  The flag normally lies along the top of the console and flips upright when, for example, one of the battery temperatures exceeds 125 F.]
167:59:48||alsj|As John goes off-camera to the left, Fendell pulls back on the zoom and pans left.]</i></blockquote>
167:59:52||alsj|Charlie hasn't heard Tony and looks at the battery temperatures.]</i></blockquote>
168:00:05||alsj|Fendell stops the counter-clockwise pan and reverses direction, panning right.]</i></blockquote>
168:00:26||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat.  He turns to his right and takes the scoop east of the Rover to find another padded-bag sample.
168:00:52||alsj|In Houston, Flight Director Pete Frank is eager to get John and Charlie on the Rover and headed for the next station.  &quot;EVA&quot;, the spokesman for the group keeping track of EVA tasks, reminds him that Charlie needs to change DAC magazines before they leave.
168:00:52||alsj|Charlie hits a couple of fist-sized rocks with the scoop to check their hardness.]</i></blockquote>
168:01:18||alsj|Charlie moves a meter or so north and hits a third rock a couple of times with the scoop.]</i></blockquote>
168:01:30||alsj|Fendell has zoomed in on a meter-sized, white boulder near the right-front Rover wheel.  Charlie is just beyond the boulder.  He plants the scoop and hops back to take a cross-Sun stereopair, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17355" target="new" target="alsj">17355</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17356" target="new" target="alsj">17356</a>.  In the photos, we can see an imprint beyond the rock that marks its original location.]</i></blockquote>
168:01:50||alsj|Charlie steps forward, grabs the scoop, slides it under the sample, and lifts it without apparent difficulty.]</i></blockquote>
168:01:56||alsj|The sample is 67215, a 277-gram breccia which is shown in Figures 66A, 66B, and 66C in the Professional Paper.
168:02:07||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right, headed for the LMP seat.  Fendell pans to follow.
168:02:26||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat.  John is undoubtedly off-camera at the CDR seat and Charlie takes the second padded-bag - which is labeled No. 1 - from him.
168:02:35||alsj|Charlie turns to his right to get some sunlight on the padded bag.  He opens the bag and stows the sample.
168:02:54||alsj|Charlie hands the padded bag to John and takes the 16-mm magazine.]</i></blockquote>
168:02:56||alsj|Charlie turns the staff that holds the 16-mm camera so he can remove the used magazine.  As the magazine comes into view, Charlie sees that the film use indicator has not changed.]</i></blockquote>
168:03:09||alsj|Charlie removes the used magazine and hits it several times with his right hand to try to dislodge the indicator.  Apparently, it moves.]</i></blockquote>
168:03:42||alsj|Charlie reaches across the Rover seats, probably so he can toss the used magazine into the CDR seatpan.  The following dialog suggests he misses the seatpan so that the magazine falls to the ground on John's side of the Rover.
168:03:43||alsj|Charlie gets the new magazine.
168:03:51||alsj|Charlie installs the new magazine.
168:04:35||alsj|Charlie reaches across the seats, takes SCB-6 from John and appears to put it in the LMP seatpan.
168:04:38||alsj|Charlie straightens the scoop head.
168:04:39||alsj|Section 14.4.10 in the ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_MissionReport.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">18 Mb PDF</a> ) Apollo 16 Mission Report ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16_MissionReport.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">18 Mb PDF</a> ) contains the following: &quot;When the crew wrapped the Velcro strap around each of the padded sample bags to further secure them, the Velcro attachment patches came off the bags and the straps were ineffective.&quot;
168:04:39||alsj|&quot;A 20-inch-long wrap-around Velcro pile strap is provided to hold the bag closed in addition to the usual tab closure ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf14-64.jpg" title="drawing" target="new" target="alsj">fig. 14-64</a> ). One end of the strap is bonded with a fluorel adhesive to an etched Teflon patch which is heat-sealed to the Teflon bag. A Velcro hook patch is bonded to the etched Teflon patch with a pressure-sensltlve adhesive and provides the attach point for the other end of the strap. The peel strength of the pressure-sensitlve bond was less than that of the Velcro pile-to-hook connections. Consequently, when the Velcro strap was adjusted to the proper tension, the hook patch came off the bag.&quot;
168:04:39||alsj|&quot;The problem resulted from using the improper bond material for the Velcro hook patch. This equipment is not scheduled for another flight and no further action is required. This anomaly is closed.&quot;
168:04:39||alsj|Charlie reaches between the seats, grabs the tongs, and goes to the back of the Rover to stow the scoop and tongs.]</i></blockquote>
168:05:05||alsj|Note that the gate on the rear of the Rover is open and that Charlie stows the scoop and tongs on the inside face of the Hand Tool Carrier (HTC).
168:05:06||alsj|John's use of 'zee' is a reference to the way the individual sample bags were sealed, by folding the top of the bag down a time or two then bending the metal tab on one side of the bag across the front of the bag and the other tab across the back.  Viewed from the top, the bend metal strip could be though of as forming the letter 'Z'. John is using 'zee' to mean 'seal'.
168:05:06||alsj|Charlie returns to the LMP seat while John comes into view at the back of the Rover and stows the second pair of tongs.]</i></blockquote>
168:05:18||alsj|Fendell pans left to take a final look at the site before turning the TV off.
168:06:11||alsj|Fendell stops to look at the north wall of North Ray.]</i></blockquote>
168:06:28||alsj|Fendell lowers his aim to look at some of the foreground rocks.
168:07:19||alsj|Charlie has been doing his best to make sure the SCB and tool harness are as secure as possible to prevent SCB from falling off John's PLSS, as happened with an empty one during the drive to North Ray at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta11.html#1663415" target="new" target="alsj">166:34:15</a>.
168:07:28||alsj|Fendell zooms in on what appears to be a half-meter boulder with dust sprayed on the visible surface.
168:08:15||alsj|TV off.
168:08:31||alsj|John has probably turned the TV camera counter-clockwise (CCW) to stow it for the drive to Station 13.
168:08:32||alsj|They arrived at North Ray at about 166:47 and have spent more than 1 hour 20 minutes here.  At 167:35, Tony told them they had 25 minutes left and they have gone noticeably past the implied 168:00 departure.
168:08:32||alsj|John parked the Rover near CY.2/79.6 and the Rover readouts at the time they parked were a LM bearing and range of 179/4.5.  The LM is near CB.1/80.6 and the Rover parking position implied by the readouts is CZ.6/80.2.  See the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272-s.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-III 3 of 3</a>&quot; map.]</i></blockquote>
168:09:25||alsj|Sometime before they start to move, Charlie takes AS16-106-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17357" target="new" target="alsj">17357</a>.  The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16trv17357-62.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photos</a> he takes during the first part of the drive are <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17357" target="new" target="alsj">17357</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17362" target="new" target="alsj">17362</a>.
168:09:59|Duke|alsj|He liked to whack rocks.  He just liked the big rocks, I guess.&quot;]
168:09:59|Jones|alsj|And he'd taken to that during training?
168:09:59|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
168:10:06||alsj|Charlie takes AS16-106-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17358" target="new" target="alsj">17358</a> as John turns to the south.  The South Ray ejecta blanket is visible beyond the white boulders.]</i></blockquote>

168:10:19||alsj|John probably has just noticed that they will be going down a steep slope.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ppD2f3.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 3</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">North Ray chapter</a> of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a> indicates that, once they get off the rim, headed ESE, they will drop about 35 meters in a distance of 150 meters.

168:12:00|Duke|alsj|Coming down the hill where we set the Moon speed record, we got that thing up to 17 km/hr, at least on the meter.  And it was something.
168:12:00|Jones|alsj|John lays the claim, here, reading the gauge as an independent, unbiased observer.&quot;]
168:12:00|Duke|alsj|That's right.

168:18:08||alsj|On the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp266-s.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-I, III,  2 of 2</a>&quot; map, the LM is near CB.1/80.6.  The LM bearing/range of 184/3.8 indicates they are near CW.1/81.9.  As shown in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16ppD2f13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">North Ray chapter</a> of the Professional Paper, the bearing/range to House Rock from their present location is 344/0.83.  As shown in the &quot;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">Descartes EVA-III 3 of 3</a>&quot; map, House Rock is at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CZ.2/80.6</a> and that puts Station 13 close to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CV.2/81.7</a>.  The position difference of 180 meters is comparable to the 250-meter error noted at Station 11 at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta11.html#1664515" target="new" target="alsj">166:45:15</a>.  The fact that the difference has decreased may be due to the fact that John was using the Rover brakes on the steep descents.  If there was significant wheel slippage do to braking, the Rover Nav system would underestimate the distance covered.
168:21:34||alsj|Charlie could be seeing spots of orange light on the ground next to the Rover.  These are actually reflections off the mirror blankets and the same phenomenon fooled Jack Schmitt during Apollo 17 Scarp Gravimeter stop at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.trvsta3.html#1435935" target="new" target="alsj">143:59:35</a>.
168:21:34|Jones|alsj|Do you remember if the reflection off the LCRU mirror was colored?
168:21:34|Duke|alsj|Not really.
168:21:34|Jones|alsj|Because it got Jack.  There was some little spots of orange on the ground a stop or two before they got to Shorty and the orange soil.
168:21:34|Duke|alsj|I don't remember what it looked like.  It probably was...Some of that Mylar was orange and it would have reflected and a couple of crystals (in the soil) would have picked up that orange reflection.  It could have been.
168:21:34||alsj|TV on.  The camera is pointed southwest and is at maximum zoom.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom before he starts panning.  There are several sizable boulders visible on the local horizon.
168:21:43||alsj|John turns the TV camera to the right and cleans the lens with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">large dustbrush</a>.
168:21:43||alsj|Fendell pans left.
168:21:43||alsj|Charlie is probably taking the Station 13 pan while he describes the site.
168:22:21||alsj|Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise stop and then starts a clockwise pan of the site.  John crosses the field-of-view from right to left, probably going to the CDR seat.
168:22:21||alsj|As Fendell pans past the high-gain mast, we see a wheel used to secure the mast during initial installation.  Fendell stops the pan at the same time Charlie starts talking.
168:23:02||alsj|John turns to his left and goes off-camera to the right, going around the front of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
168:23:09||alsj|John re-appears from the right and bounds across the field-of-view, headed for the back of the Rover to get a pair of tongs.]
168:23:09||alsj|Fendell continues the pan, stopping every few degrees to let someone in the Backroom take a Polaroid photo of the scene.]</i></blockquote>
168:23:46||alsj|John is referring both to the amount of dirt on the color/gray scale and, jokingly, to the fact that they still have seen none of the volcanic rocks that some of the geologists expected they would find.]</i></blockquote>
168:23:49||alsj|Figuratively, if not literally, they are shaking their heads in disbelief over all the minor equipment problems they are having.]
168:23:49||alsj|Fendell is looking more or less north.  As he continues to pan to the right, Charlie comes into view at the right side of the picture.  He is carrying the rake.  At about the same time, John comes into view, running out to join Charlie and carrying the tongs and the gnomon legs.]</i></blockquote>
168:24:11||alsj|They had planned to start EVA-3 at a Ground Elapsed Time (GET) of 148:25 and Station 13 three and a half hours later at a GET of about 152 hours.  As is shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp006.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">2.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, the Sun's elevation at that time would have been about 38 degrees.  Because of the landing delay and the changes in EVA schedule, the Sun's elevation is currently 46 degrees.  When Charlie says that the Sun is &quot;up over Stone&quot;, he has either mis-spoken and meant to say &quot;Smoky&quot; or is merely referring to the significant elevation.  Sun's azimuth is about 80 degrees east of north while the summit of Stone mountain is at an azimuth of about 170.]
168:24:11||alsj|John puts the gnomon down near the rocks Charlie had indicated.  Charlie gets into position to take a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;.  Fendell continues the clockwise pan; and Shadow Rock comes into view at the right side of the picture.]</i></blockquote>
168:24:19||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun &quot;before&quot; is AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17408" target="new" target="alsj">17408</a>.  John's cross-Sun stereopair from the south is AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18661" target="new" target="alsj">18661</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18662" target="new" target="alsj">18662</a>.] </i></blockquote>
168:24:50||alsj|Fendell is looking at the right side of Shadow Rock, with Ravine Crater on the flank of Smoky Mountain in the background.  Charlie is probably taking a &quot;locator&quot; AS16-106-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17409" target="new" target="alsj">17409</a>, which shows John holding the tongs and, in the background, the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
168:25:37||alsj|John may have just taken AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18663" target="new" target="alsj">18663</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18664" target="new" target="alsj">18664</a>, which are cross-Suns from the south showing Charlie raking.
168:25:56||alsj|As Fendell approaches the clockwise stop, Stone Mountain is visible over the LMP seat.  Fendell reverses direction.]
168:25:56||alsj|Charlie has moved around to the south side of the gnomon, as shown in John's photo AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18665" target="new" target="alsj">18665</a>, which he took from the north side of the gnomon.]
168:25:56|Duke|alsj|It was better to be raking up slope because, raking down slope, you couldn't get the handle low enough to keep the tines parallel to the surface.  They were elevated, so you couldn't dig them in that far. So, raking upslope, your tines get parallel to the surface and you can actually dig them in a little bit more.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
168:26:21||alsj|At some point, John moves around and takes a final picture from the south, AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18666" target="new" target="alsj">18666</a>, as Charlie finishes the raking.
168:26:37||alsj|These samples are 63520-98 and are shown in Figures 36A to 36I in the Professional paper.  The collection includes fragments of both breccias and crystalline rocks.
168:26:53||alsj|Fendell gets Shadow Rock centered in the TV picture and zooms in on the shadowed south face.  Tony asks the Backroom if this might be a place to get a permanently shadowed sample and Jim Lovell, the spokesman for the Backroom, replies that they don't have enough time at this stop to do that.  As Fendell zooms in, the automatic iris opens and we get a reasonably good look at the shadowed rock face.  Lovell tells Flight that, while John gets the LPM measurement, they'd like to have Charlie sample the boulder.
168:27:01||alsj|Charlie is using the rake to get a soil sample and, apparently, is having trouble getting his suit to bend enough.]</i></blockquote>
168:27:27||alsj|This is a reference to the American escape artist, Harry Houdini (1874-1926).]</i></blockquote>
168:27:58||alsj|As Fendell pulls back on the zoom, Charlie crosses the field-of-view and goes around the right side of the Rover.  He is probably headed to the back of the vehicle to stow the rake.  At about this time, John takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; of the rake site, AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18667" target="new" target="alsj">18667</a>.]</i></blockquote>
168:28:27||alsj|John would normally position the LPM down-Sun of the Rover.
168:28:39||alsj|Fendell pans right.
168:29:06||alsj|Apparently, the magnetometer cable attachment at the back of the Rover points toward the left and, if John goes out behind the Rover, the cable will be bent and will have uneven stress at the connection.
168:29:06||alsj|Fendell finds John at the back of the Rover, behind the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>
168:29:30||alsj|John lifts the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LPM tripod</a> out of its holder and backs away from the Rover to the southeast.]</i></blockquote>
168:29:31||alsj|John is a Naval Aviator and, like many naval aviators, doesn't use nautical terminology with ease.  Of course, John often has trouble expressing himself clearly and those who do not know him sometimes do not realize that this is part of a facade that hides a splendid engineering mind.
168:29:48||alsj|John goes off-camera to the left and Charlie comes into view for a moment at the right edge of the picture.  He appears to be several meters south of the Rover.  After a few seconds, Fendell pans left to find John.  Off-camera, Charlie probably goes to Shadow Rock.
168:30:52||alsj|The <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy93.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">SESC</a>, or Special Environmental Sample Can, is the vacuum sealed container that they lost on the way to North Ray Crater.  See Charlie's comment at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta11.html#1670016" target="new" target="alsj">167:00:16</a>.  See, also, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy91.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Figure 91</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Catalog.  Once the permanently shadowed sample is returned to Earth, it will be analyzed to determine the relative abundances of volatile components implanted by the Solar Wind and, to get the best results, Charlie had planned to use the SESC to provide backup vacuum protection to the rock box.]
168:30:52||alsj|John has reached the end of the magnetometer cable and is taking a few moments to position the tripod.
168:30:52||alsj|At Shadow Rock, Charlie takes three pictures of the permanently-shadowed area, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17410" target="new" target="alsj">17410</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17411" target="new" target="alsj">17411</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17412" target="new" target="alsj">17412</a>.  He steps to his left between frames.]</i></blockquote>
168:31:07||alsj|Fendell pans left to find Charlie.
168:31:08||alsj|As Fendell pans past the right edge of Shadow Rock, we see the tongs planted in the ground, out of the way while Charlie uses the scoop.  Fendell then finds Charlie who is on his knees in the shadow of the boulder and with his back to us.  He is collecting a soil sample with the scoop.
168:31:08|Jones|alsj|I gather that there's a hollow place back in there, in the shadow and under the rock.
168:31:08|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  That rock is sitting up there and it's like somebody dug out under there.  The rock's coming up like this and, right up under here, there's like a hole...It was sort of like it was tottering up there.  And I could get down on my knees and I could reach </i>way<i> back up under there with the shovel.  'About a meter', I said (at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1683201" target="new" target="alsj">168:32:01</a>).
168:31:08|Jones|alsj|Did you have to hold on to the rock to get your knees bent?
168:31:08|Duke|alsj|I was on the ground; yeah.  That's what I did.
168:31:08||alsj|After a few seconds, Charlie rises to his feet.
168:32:08||alsj|Charlie has the scoop in his right hand, and is probably holding it near the head.  The scoop handle is visible at Charlie's left side.  He uses his left hand to remove a sample bag from his camera.]</i></blockquote>
168:32:18||alsj|Out of view, Charlie appears to transfer the bag to his right hand and the scoop to his left.  Once again, he appears to be holding the scoop near the head and has no trouble rotating the handle up  to make the pour.
168:32:30||alsj|Charlie turns to his right, facing east.
168:32:33||alsj|Charlie steps out of the shadow far enough that his helmet is in full Sun.
168:32:40||alsj|Charlie turns a half circle to his right and, facing west, steps back into the shadow.  He transfers the sample bag to his left hand and uses his right to lower his gold visor.
168:32:54||alsj|Charlie turns to face the Rover and plants the scoop to his left, near the rake.  He then heads for the Rover, sealing  the bag as he goes, and goes off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>
168:33:12||alsj|Fendell pans right.  In the background, Ravine Crater is the very large depression on the southern flank of Smoky Mountain.]</i></blockquote>
168:33:20||alsj|John was supposed to turn the magnetometer on before he left the Rover so that the sensor could warm up before he started the first measurement.  Charlie is probably at the back of the Rover but hasn't done much training with the magnetometer and is not confident that he can turn it on.  At <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1683332" target="new" target="alsj">168:33:32</a> John tells Houston that he's back at the Rover, although his tone of voice suggests he got back earlier, perhaps as early as <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1683323" target="new" target="alsj">168:33:23</a>.  It would have taken John about 15 seconds to run the 15-meter distance from the magnetometer to the Rover - as he does, on-camera, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1683729" target="new" target="alsj">168:37:29</a> - and  it is simply not possible that he left the magnetometer at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1683314" target="new" target="alsj">168:33:14</a> and arrived at 168:33:23.  Neither is it possible that Charlie turned it on while John was still at the magnetometer at 168:33:23, because there is no way that John then could have gotten back to the Rover before 168:33:32.  The only way I can make the timing work is if John started back to the Rover before 168:33:14 and, on the way, realized that he hadn't turned on the instrument.  He then gets to the Rover at about 168:33:23 and puts the switch to the On position.]</i></blockquote>
168:33:26||alsj|Charlie is probably trying to get a spare SCB off the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
168:33:30||alsj|Charlie crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left.  He is headed back to Shadow Rock and is carrying a spare SCB.  Fendell continues to pan until the magnetometer comes into view and then stops.]</i></blockquote>
168:33:39||alsj|Fendell reverses direction to find Charlie.
168:33:39||alsj|John takes two pictures of the magnetometer.  AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18668" target="new" target="alsj">18668</a> is a &quot;locator&quot; taken past the back of the Rover and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18669" target="new" target="alsj">18669</a> is a stereo companion taken over the seats.]</i></blockquote>
168:33:56||alsj|The SCB comes into view.  Charlie placed it upright near the rake.]</i></blockquote>
168:34:11||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie kneeling in front of the boulder, with his back to us.  He is in about the same position he was in when he got the first soil sample.
168:34:16||alsj|This is a repeat of the discussion of Charlie's &quot;shopping bag&quot; idea, which he first raised at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta11.html#1673450" target="new" target="alsj">167:34:50 </a>at North Ray Crater.]</i></blockquote>
168:34:25||alsj|Charlie rises to his feet and John joins him from the left.  John reaches to get a bag off Charlie's camera.
168:34:27||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the sample area but, because of the relative brightness of Charlie's legs, we can't see any detail in the shadow at the base of the rock.
168:34:53||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right and, as he does, the automatic iris on the TV opens up and we get a view of the mottled surface of the base of the rock.
168:35:00||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and finds John, who was just off-camera to the left.
168:35:28||alsj|John finishes his examination of Shadow Rock, turns to his right, and hops out past the SCB.
168:35:32||alsj|John turns to his left to examine the rock from a distance of a couple of meters.
168:35:45||alsj|John did not mention vesicles during the traverse to Station 11, although Charlie's use of the term &quot;frothy-looking boulders&quot; in the discussion after <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta11.html#1663549" target="new" target="alsj">166:35:49</a> may be a reference to vesicles.]</i></blockquote>
168:35:45||alsj|During this conversation, Charlie has been taking a series of pictures of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta13rock.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">Shadow Rock</a>, AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17413" target="new" target="alsj">17413</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17417" target="new" target="alsj">17417</a>.  The first of these shows John facing the rock and was taken before about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1683530" target="new" target="alsj">168:35:30</a>.  Dave Byrne has created a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1683548.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">portrait of Shadow Rock</a>.]</i></blockquote>
168:35:50||alsj|&quot;Zap holes&quot; or &quot;zap pits&quot; are small craters dug into the surface of a rock by a small impact.  Vesicles are imprints of gas bubbles trapped in a molten rock as it cools.  Here, John is probably seeing vesicles formed when parts of Shadow Rock were molten, perhaps during the North Ray impact when it was ejected.  According to George Ulrich, the author of the North Ray chapter in the Professional Paper, Shadow Rock is a dark-matrix breccia similar to House Rock.]</i></blockquote>
168:35:53||alsj|John reaches down, opens the top of the SCB, and stows the second soil sample.  Behind him, Charlie leans the scoop against the east face of the rock and leans in to get his face plate close to the top of a small projection.]</i></blockquote>
168:36:00||alsj|John runs over to help Charlie.
168:36:08||alsj|During Charlie's next transmission, John takes a cross-Sun stereopair from the south that shows Charlie and the rock face he is examining.  These pictures are AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18670" target="new" target="alsj">18670</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18671" target="new" target="alsj">18671</a>.  John then runs back to the Rover and goes off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>
168:36:12||alsj|Cleavage, in mineralogy, is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite crystallographic structural planes. These planes of relative weakness are a result of the regular locations of atoms and ions in the crystal, which create smooth repeating surfaces that are visible both in the microscope and to the naked eye.
168:36:12||alsj|Charlie runs back to the Rover to change film and goes off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>
168:36:43||alsj|Fendell pulls back on the zoom and Charlie crosses the field-of-view from right to left, probably going to the CDR seat where the fresh magazines are stored.]</i></blockquote>

168:37:27||alsj|Fendell is looking over the right-rear fender and John is at the right edge of the TV picture.  He turns and runs out to get the magnetometer, making the 15-m trip in about 14 seconds.]
168:37:27||alsj|Off-camera, Charlie has probably finished loading Magazine F into his Hasselblad and has taken a frame, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18726" target="new" target="alsj">18726</a>, to make sure he will have unexposed film for his sample documentation.]</i></blockquote>
168:37:53||alsj|At some point after he gets back to Shadow Rock, Charlie takes a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16pan1683802.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">flightline stereo</a> sequence of the base, stepping to his right between frames.

168:38:16||alsj|John runs toward the Rover.  He stops a couple of meters short and turns to look at some of the places where he has kicked the surface layer aside while running.
168:38:41||alsj|John steps toward the right-rear corner of the Rover.  He has been carrying the magnetometer tripod in his right hand and realizes that, to get everything stowed, he needs to have the cable entirely on his left side.  To fix the problem, he turns to his right and goes through 360 degrees, transferring the tripod to his left hand as he turns through north.  He then stows the tripod in its sleeve on the back of the Rover, knocking down the back of LMP seat in the process.  In principle, John could have lifted the tripod high enough to pass the cable over his head while still facing the Rover, but there would have been a good chance of snagging the cable on his PLSS  and his decision to make the 360 degree turn was probably a good one.
168:38:41||alsj|Charlie is probably congratulating himself on picking a couple of places from which to chip samples.
168:38:41||alsj|John goes off-camera to the left to get the cable reel.
168:39:26||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds John with the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">cable reel</a> already in his hands.  John turns to his right to look at Charlie, who is probably on the east side of Shadow Rock.  He may have knocked off the large sample he eventually picks up at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1684114" target="new" target="alsj">168:41:14</a> and may have fallen trying to get down to get it up off the ground.]</i></blockquote>
168:39:49||alsj|John drops the cable reel and runs off-camera to the left to help.  Fendell pans left to follow.
168:39:50||alsj|Before Fendell gets Shadow Rock in view, John re-appears, running back to the cable reel.  As Fendell continues the pan, Charlie comes into view, holding the hammer.  He steps toward a corner on the southeast side  of the boulder and knocks a sample off.  He taps the rock several times, left-handed, and breaks at least one loose.  He then steps back, transfers the hammer to his right hand and stows it in his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.  The sampling area is shown in Figure 35B in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a> and in AS16-106- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#17414" target="new" target="alsj">17414</a>.] </i></blockquote>
168:39:50||alsj|Charlie gets a sample bag off his camera,  steps forward to get the tongs, and picks up a sample.
168:40:39||alsj|Having bagged the first sample, Charlie uses the tongs to pick up the second and bag it.  These two small samples are 63335 and 63355, which have a combined mass of about 133 grams.
168:40:45||alsj|Charlie plants the tongs near the SCB and then spins the sample bag to seal it. During his next transmission he opens the SCB, stows the sample, and reaches for the scoop.
168:41:00||alsj|Charlie gets the scoop in his left hand and, uses it as a prop while he goes to his knees next to the SCB.  Once down, he grabs a large sample in his right hand and rolls it against his knee, much as he did with Big Muley at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta1.html#1240801" target="new" target="alsj">124:08:01</a> at Station 1.  However, this rock, unlike Big Muley, is small enough that, eventually, he gets his hand completely under it and can get to his feet without having to press the sample against his leg.  This large sample is 60017, a 2.1 kg breccia which is shown in Figure 35C in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16profpaper.htm" target="new" target="alsj">Professional Paper</a>.  In a footnote to the figure, the authors of the Professional Paper state that &quot;sample 60017 was assigned a LM/ALSEP number (that is, the initial '60') before its source location at Station 13 was recognized with assurance.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
168:41:17||alsj|Charlie transfers the sample to his left hand, grabs the SCB cover in his right hand.  The SCB opens as he lifts it and he then drops the sample, unbagged, into the SCB.
168:41:34||alsj|Charlie grabs the tongs and, carrying the tongs, scoop, and SCB, heads toward the Rover and goes off-camera to the right.
168:41:34|Jones|alsj|This is a really nice little piece of TV about efficient solo sampling.&quot;]
168:41:34|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  You're working around a rock like that, it was a lot easier.  I had the tongs; I came prepared.  I had the little sample bag (SCB) on the ground.  Once you get that way, you don't have to take all those pictures and stuff.  You could work solo, if you had everything. We've learned a little bit, so we got more efficient at it.  We knew what to take with us.&quot;]
168:41:34|Jones|alsj|You could use the shovel as a prop to help you get down on your knees and then get back up.  Use the rock.&quot;]
168:41:34|Duke|alsj|And we had the tongs.  It worked pretty good.
168:41:34|Jones|alsj|And I guess sampling a rock face was a little bit easier...&quot;]
168:41:34|Duke|alsj|It was easy to hammer.  You didn't have to get real low to hammer, like John did a couple of times over at Plum.  It just worked well.&quot;]
168:41:34|Jones|alsj|It seems to me that the suit designers for the extended mission are going to have to think carefully about reinforcing the knees or having some kind of a replacement pad; because, being able to get down close to the ground is vital for not only this work but, also, all the non-geology stuff that people are going to be doing later on.&quot;]
168:41:34|Duke|alsj|You need a lot more mobility in that suit.  Seems to me you needed something where you could bend at the waist and bend at the knees, basically like you could walk up steps.  You couldn't do that in the Apollo suit.
168:41:34|Jones|alsj|You couldn't walk up steps.
168:41:34|Duke|alsj|And you couldn't bend at the waist.  It's just too stiff.  The arms weren't bad; the mobility in the arms was pretty good.  And the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new" target="alsj">gloves</a> were pretty good, they're just hard to squeeze.  Yeah; it's going to require a lot of thought, for a stay of a month or more.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
168:42:03||alsj|Fendell pans right.
168:42:10||alsj|Charlie wants John to take the scoop and tongs while he stows the SCB under the LMP seat.
168:42:40||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat.  Charlie turns and sees the TV looking at him.
168:42:44||alsj|John is at the back of the Rover stowing the tools.]</i></blockquote>
168:42:46||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right, headed to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-52.jpg" title="LCRU Battery" target="new" target="alsj">controls</a> on the left side of the LCRU.]</i></blockquote>
168:43:05||alsj|TV off.
168:43:39||alsj|Charlie is probably trying to get in the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>
168:43:58|Jones|alsj|What I think I'm hearing here is that you were getting on the Rover but the SCB was getting hung up on the seat.  Is that right?&quot;]
168:43:58|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.
168:43:58|Jones|alsj|I thought the SCB was on the outside.
168:43:58|Duke|alsj|It is; but I was getting hung up on something.  I don't remember.  I think, probably, what it was is once you get in, if you get in sideways, that bag can hit on the side of the seat.  And then you're trying to get straightened back in there.  That's what happened.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
168:44:28||alsj|John parked the Rover on a northerly heading and, while Charlie waits for John to get seated, he has a good view to the north.]</i></blockquote>
||alsj|When John and Charlie arrived at Station 13, the LM bearing/range was <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">184/3.8</a>.  With the LM near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp267.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CB.1/80.6</a>, these readings give a Station 13 location near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp271.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CW.1/81.9</a>.  As is discussed in the commentary following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta13.html#1681845" target="new" target="alsj">168:18:45</a>, their actual position is about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp271.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CV.2/80.6</a>.  The position difference of 180 meters is about the same size and direction as the error noted at Station 11 at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta11.html#1664515" target="new" target="alsj">166:45:15</a>.

||alsj|With regard to the difference between the indicated nav system position here at Station 13 and the actual location, note that, when John and Charlie get back to the LM at 169:16:11, the nav system will show them close to their actual location.  If the difference was due to wheel slippage during the climb to the rim of North Ray, similar wheel slippage  on the way back during the climbs up to the rim of Palmetto or up the east-west ridge north of the LM could reduces the difference.
168:46:43||alsj|As shown in EVA-2 <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva2CDR18-19.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-18</a>, Station 10 was about halfway between the LM and the ALSEP site.

End gets its name from the fact that it was to have been the site of Station 17, the last planned stop of the traverse.

168:49:15||alsj|These boulders are probably about 1.5 km south of the crew's present location.
168:50:16||alsj|The formal definition of a 'cobble' is a piece of rock between about 6.4 cm and 25.6 cm.  Anything bigger than 25.6 cm is a 'boulder' while pieces between about 0.4 cm and 6.4 cm is a 'pebble'.  Of course, judging the sizes of pieces of rock from the moving Rover is imprecise at best, and his use of 'cobble' in the sense of 'relatively big but not a boulder' can't be faulted.

168:51:31||alsj|John and Charlie first tried this technique during the return to the LM at the end of EVA-2.  The Apollo 17 crew used the technique to good advantage at several places and Jack Schmitt was able to change camera settings while taking the pans, correcting for the changing sun angle as Gene Cernan drove around in a tight circle.
168:51:45||alsj|This readout indicates a position near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp271.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CS.3/83.6</a>, which is about 700 meters NNE of Dot Crater.

168:53:02|Duke|alsj|Higher than that.
168:53:02|Jones|alsj|So, you had to get the arm up.  And did you have to go forward?
168:53:02|Duke|alsj|Yeah.  It was like this.
168:53:02|Jones|alsj|So you had to get your face out over your knees.&quot;]

168:55:28||alsj|Very fresh, small craters often have a glass-coating in the bottom - made during the impact if the projectile velocity was high enough - and numerous clumps of compressed soil.  The latter is called &quot;indurated regolith&quot; or, more colorfully, &quot;instant rock&quot;.  Charlie is asking if it would be possible to use samples of the glass and/or instant rock to date impacts that made them.
168:56:41||alsj|They have not reached End and will not do so until <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1685904" target="new" target="alsj">168:59:04</a>.  Charlie's comment about &quot;looking into End&quot; suggests that, at least for the moment, they are above End.
168:57:00||alsj|This is probably a reference to a pre-flight discussion.

168:57:12||alsj|On flat ground, John's usual speed is about 10 km/hr.  A speed of 14 km/hr strongly suggests that, since Charlie said they were &quot;looking into End&quot;, they have been dropping down into a depression.

169:00:07||alsj|These readouts give a location of CL.4/82.2.

It has been about a minute since Charlie reported they were passing End which, assuming a speed of 9 km/hr, suggests they are about 150 meters south of End, in reasonable agreement with the estimated 180-m error of their Station 13 position.  Charlie's next transmission indicates that they are looking into Palmetto.

169:02:30||alsj|Charlie's next <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16trv18773-79.jpg" title="strip of images" target="new" target="alsj">seven traverse photos</a> are AS16-117-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18773" target="new" target="alsj">18773</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18779" target="new" target="alsj">18779</a>.

169:04:04|Jones|alsj|We haven't heard either of you use the word 'bench' in reference to craters very much, if at all.  The folks who went to the mare sites certainly saw benches down in craters that corresponded to roughly where the regolith/bedrock boundary was.
169:04:04|Duke|alsj|We didn't have any.
169:04:04|Jones|alsj|Were all the craters pretty much bowl shaped?
169:04:04|Duke|alsj|Uh-huh.  And just loose blocks on the side.  There was some benches up on the mountains; and we used that term for that.  But we didn't have any in the craters.
169:04:40||alsj|The readouts indicate a location near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CH.9/82.3</a>.  They are actually very near the planned traverse and are seeing higher LM bearings than expected because John landed about 200 meters NNW of the planned landing site.
169:04:48||alsj|John has seen a rock just ahead that is taller than the Rover's 14-inch (35-cm) clearance.  This could be the rock in AS16-117-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18786" target="new" target="alsj">18786</a>.
169:05:46||alsj|The Apollo 15 crew experienced heart-irregularities called PVCs (post-ventricular contractions) which were traced to a potassium deficiency they accumulated during training, primarily during suited, EVA training in the Florida sun.  John and Charlie are drinking fortified liquids to prevent a recurrence.
169:05:46||alsj|Journal Contributor Brian Lawrence notes that John's statement, &quot;implies that he has been drinking while driving, which suggests he has a lot of confidence.  I would have guessed it would be distracting to find the valve.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
169:06:02||alsj|In large, liquid-fueled rockets like the Saturn V, the tanks have to be baffled to reduce fuel sloshing and the attendant variable loads on the vehicle.  John has been complaining throughout the mission about the orders he and Charlie and Ken have been given to drink lots of liquids.]
169:06:02|Jones|alsj|Was fuel-slosh an aircraft problem?  Spacecraft?  Or both?&quot;]
169:06:02|Duke|alsj|It could be both.  Yeah: big airplanes.  They baffle the tanks, usually; but it is not much of a problem any more with big airplanes.  But, in the spacecraft, in the big rockets without the right baffles, yeah, fuel sloshing could be a big problem.  Mainly, fuel slosh is a problem with Navy ships, though.  Big ships.  They rock like this and pitch and the fuel's going back and forth in the tanks.  Liquids on a big ship, if the tanks aren't baffled, they can really be a problem.&quot;]
169:06:02|Jones|alsj|Especially if the tank's resonant  frequency is about the same as the wave frequency.
169:06:17||alsj|During the 65 hours since John and Charlie landed, the Moon has rotated under the plane of the Command Module's orbit and the displacement is now about 33 degrees in longitude.  Mattingly has just performed a Service Engine burn to change the orientation of his orbit so he will pass over the landing site when John and Charlie return to orbit at about 175:30.
169:07:44|Duke|alsj|John handled the magnetometer, so he had an interest in it.  You tended to pick an interest, more, in what you were doing, in what you were trained to do.
169:07:44||alsj|&quot;Endogenic&quot; means internally generated.  Charlie is saying that he sees no evidence that the crater was formed by impact.  An example of an endogenic crater would be a sink.  One can imagine, for example, a surface subsidence over a covered lava tube, although such a feature would be highly unlikely at Cayley.
169:08:04|Jones|alsj|What, pray tell, is a 'Doodlebug Hole'?&quot;]
169:08:04|Duke|alsj|You've never seen a doodlebug?
169:08:04|Jones|alsj|I've never seen a doodlebug hole.  Sorry.
169:08:04|Duke|alsj|Well, in the South, when I was a little kid, my Grandmamma had a house that was up on posts - pillars.  And so, as kids, you could crawl underneath.  On hands and knees you could crawl under the house; and it was sandy under there.  And there was these little bugs - we called 'em Doodlebugs, but I don't know what they were.  It wasn't like they dug a hole like this (throwing the dirt out in a pile around the hole), it was like they just drilled down and everything fell into it.  So it was a level surface (around the lip of the hole); you'd come up and there was no rim to this hole, it was just sunk in.  So, what I'm saying is, this hole that we're describing here was like that: it just came, and it didn't have any rim around the hole - which indicates ejecta.  It was like everything just sunk out the bottom.  So it looked like doodlebug holes.&quot;]
169:08:04|Jones|alsj|And the doodlebugs burrowed in sand.
169:08:04|Duke|alsj|Yeah, they burrowed in sand.  And we used to have a rhyme.  I can't remember.  You take a little piece straw off a broom and 'Doodlebug, doodlebug, are you at home?'  And you'd spin this little piece of straw around in this little doodlebug hole and, if he was there, eventually you'd work him up to the top.&quot;]
169:08:04|Jones|alsj|How big were they?
169:08:04|Duke|alsj|There were little.  Not even as big as the tips of your fingers.  And I forgot what else they look like; but they were real small little bugs, almost like a sand flea.&quot;]
169:08:04||alsj|Mark Swanson, creator/editor of <a href="http://www.antlionpit.com/" target="new" target="alsj">The Antlion Pit: A Doodlebug Anthology</a>, tells us that "<a href="a16.doodlebug.html" target="new" target="alsj">Doodlebug</a>" is a colloquial name for the larvae of pit-digging species within the antlion family (Myrmeleontidae), which are insects related to lacewings. They are found in many parts of the world.
169:08:04||alsj|See, also, page 19 in Arthur C. Clarke's 1961 novel, &quot;A Fall of Moondust&quot;.  Mark writes, &quot;I'm curious how Clarke learned of antlions. If he spent his childhood in the UK, it's unlikely he saw one as a child as antlions are extremely rare in the UK (a tiny colony in Suffolk, very far from Somerset). Perhaps he learned about them in Sri Lanka and saw children playing with them. Curious.&quot;  Clarke was born in 1917 and lived in Sri Lanka from 1956 until his death in 2008.
169:08:08||alsj|The indicated location is near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CF.4/82.0</a>, although their actual position may be 150-200 meters farther south.  In a moment, Charlie will describe the crater as being at least 200 meters across and 40 meters deep, suggesting that he is describing the feature centered at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CE.1/80.4</a>.  This is the same feature Charlie described as a '<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">big sag</a>' on the outbound trip at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.trvsta11.html#1661240" target="new" target="alsj">166:12:40</a>.
169:08:24||alsj|Tony is asking if the sink hole is on the top of a dome - which might indicate that the dome was a volcanic construct; but John and Charlie tell him that they are currently driving on a bit of elevated ground.
169:09:11||alsj|Charlie wants John to drive in a tight circle so he can take another Rover pan.
169:09:30|Jones|alsj|90/270?
169:09:30|Duke|alsj|That's a aircraft term.  As pilot, you're flying along and you make a 90-degree turn and fly, and then you do a 270-degree turn, which gets you going in the opposite direction on the same track you were going out on.&quot;]
169:09:30|Jones|alsj|Ah!  So you do a 90 degree turn (to the right).  And then you do a 270 (to the left)...&quot;]
169:09:30|Duke|alsj|And the 270 brings you back going this way.
169:09:30|Jones|alsj|So the 90 displaces you off far enough so that, when  you do the 270, you're coming back along your outbound track.
169:09:30|Duke|alsj|See, what I wanted him to do was to come this way (to the right), and then he'd start back (to the left); and, as he started back through, I'd start taking pictures.
169:09:30||alsj|Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien is a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../frank97.jpeg" target="new" target="alsj">licensed pilot</a>. &quot;The origin of the '90/270' phrase comes from aviation instrument flight rules, specifically what is called a 'procedure turn'.  Procedure turns are used as part of many instrument landing approaches. Usually, the aircraft flies over a navigation checkpoint (the initial approach fix) in a direction opposite the desired landing path. A procedure turn is made to reverse course towards the runway, and is often designed to intercept the ILS (Instrument Landing System) or localizer.&quot;
169:09:30||alsj|&quot;The purpose of having such strictly defined turns is to ensure that aircraft remain within a strictly defined airspace. For example, in an aircraft traveling north, a right 90/left 270 ensures that the aircraft will not enter airspace to the west of the original flight path.   If I remember correctly, 90/270 procedure turns were used mostly by the military, and may be rarely used today. More commonly, procedure turns are 45/180/45, which is 45 degrees right turn, 180 degrees left, 45 degrees (left again).&quot;]</i></blockquote>

169:09:43||alsj|Charlie's picture of this small, glass-bottomed crater is AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18789" target="new" target="alsj">18789</a>.]
169:09:43||alsj|This frame is part of the next sequence of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16trv18787-93.jpg" title="strip of images" target="new" target="alsj">seven traverse photos</a>, which are AS16-117-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18787" target="new" target="alsj">18787</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18793" target="new" target="alsj">18793</a>.
169:10:02||alsj|With the LM at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CB.1/80.6</a>, a nav readout of 198/0.7 puts the crater near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CE.4/81.7</a>.  As indicated above, the feature in pan camera frame <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/AS16-4618EVA3lbl.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">AS16-4618</a> that seems to match Charlie's description, particularly with regard to it's diameter, is centered at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CE.1/80.4</a>.  If John has given the nav readout as they passed east of the crater, it would seem that much of the difference between nav system locations and actual locations seen at Stations 11 and 13 has disappeared.
169:10:36||alsj|John is thinking that, without a rim to provide shadowing, the shallow features are not visible in the pre-mission photos used to make the map.  That is certainly true of the shallowest features but, in this case, I believe the sink hole does show up, albeit indistinctly.
169:11:22||alsj|The indicated location is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp270.jpg" title="map" target="new" target="alsj">CD.5/81.3</a>.  They are approaching the east-west ridge north of the LM.
169:11:22||alsj|During the return traverse to the LM, John has taken photos AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18672" target="new" target="alsj">18672</a> to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18674" target="new" target="alsj">18674</a>.]
169:11:22||alsj|Brian Lawrence notes, &quot;I thought drinking and driving was quite impressive, but he's taking pictures too! See the dialog at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta9.html#1482459" target="new" target="alsj">148:24:59</a>, where Tony says 'Let's put Bravo on John's since he doesn't shoot while he's driving'.&quot;]
169:11:22||alsj|At about the present moment, Charlie takes AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18794" target="new" target="alsj">18794</a> which is notable because it shows a sharp turn that John made during the outbound traverse to skirt a crater.

169:12:00||alsj|With the Rover pointed directly at the LM, the spacecraft is partly hidden by the high-gain antenna and John turns the Rover slightly to get a better view.  John takes AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18676" target="new" target="alsj">18676</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18677" target="new" target="alsj">18677</a>.] </i></blockquote>

169:12:30||alsj|John is thinking that, because they are above the LM and the ALSEP area, they may be able to see brightness contrast at the edge of the ray.
169:13:27||alsj|Charlie's first LM picture is AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18797" target="new" target="alsj">18797</a>.

169:13:36||alsj|Charlie is not suggesting that John go into reverse but, rather, wants John to reverse the direction of the turn he has been taking and point the Rover more at the LM.

169:13:48||alsj|Charlie is talking about the 15-m crater that is directly east of the LM.  John overflew this crater during the final approach.]</i></blockquote>
169:13:57||alsj|As we will hear in a moment, John is still thinking about the problem of identifying the edge of a ray.
169:13:58||alsj|Charlie takes AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18799" target="new" target="alsj">18799</a> and, at some point, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18800" target="new" target="alsj">18800</a>.]
169:13:58||alsj|John's final two traverse photos are AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18679" target="new" target="alsj">18679</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18680" target="new" target="alsj">18680</a>, with the latter being similar to Charlie's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18799" target="new" target="alsj">18799</a>.] </i></blockquote>
169:15:20||alsj|Charlie is probably thinking that either a north or a south heading will give good cross-Sun TV coverage of the sampling they will do next.
169:17:10||alsj|John parked on a south heading of 180.  The indicated bearing to the LM is 188 but, this close to the spacecraft, the reading is meaningless.  As shown in figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, John has parked about 10 meters due north of the large boulder near the ALSEP and about 70 meters WSW of the LM.  The Nav system indicates that John drove a total of 11.1 km on this EVA and that he is about 0.1 km from the LM.  Clearly, the Nav system has worked superbly.
||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, John has parked about 30 meters north of the ALSEP Central Station and 10 meters north of the 2-meter boulder.  The Rover is pointed south.
169:18:33||alsj|TV on.  The camera is pointed more or less northwest and Charlie crosses the field-of-view from right to left as he gets into position to take the pan.
169:18:50||alsj|The TV image jiggles, perhaps as John tries to free the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a> from its holder on the front of the Rover.  A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16brush.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a> from training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#KSC71PC777" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71PC-777</a> shows the stowed dustbrush.
169:18:57||alsj|Apparently, John has dropped the dust brush.
169:18:57||alsj|TV off.  As Charlie implies at 169:19:22, John has probably bumped against the high-gain antenna, knocking it out of alignment.
169:18:57||alsj|I do not believe that Charlie comes over to help John at this point.  As he says in a moment, he is taking his pan.
169:19:34||alsj|Journal Contributor Jim Murray has combined frames 18816 and 18818 and has largely removed the effects of sunlight reflected in the lens to produce a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mini18816-8.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">striking up-Sun view of John at the Rover with the LM in the background</a>.
169:19:34||alsj|Journal Contributor Dominique Caudron notes that Charlie caught Venus just over the eastern horizon in <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18815" target="new" target="alsj">18815, 16, and 17</a>.

At the time Charlie took the pan, about 1914 GMT/UTC on 23 April 1972, the Sun's azimuth and elevation were 77.8 and 47.2 degress, respectively and Venus's were 84.4 and 2.9 degrees.  Venus's apparent magnitude was -4.4.  A <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16vert18815.jpg" title="image detail" target="new" target="alsj">vertical slice</a> thru the photo shows shadow orientations in the foreground.  Venus rose at the Descartes site at about 164:05, about an hour and a half before the start of EVA-3.  However, Charlie's Station 10 Prime Pan is the first sequence of EVA-3 photos in which Venus is not hidden by the LM or high ground on the eastern horizon.  Venus was also captured in a number of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a14/a14Venus.html" target="new" target="alsj">images taken by Al Shepard</a> during Apollo 14.</i></blockquote>
169:20:26||alsj|TV on.  The TV camera is now pointed north-northeast, over the left-rear Rover wheel.  John may have moved the camera when he was re-aligning the antenna.

169:21:20||alsj|Finally, Ulli Lotzmann has provided a relevant extract from the NASA document &quot;AP16 Problem and Discrepancy List&quot;, dated 26 June 1972:  &quot;The sun shade is secured in place by Velcro hooks on the sun shade and Velcro pile on the camera. The Velcro pile is sewn in place on the television blanket. The Velcro hooks are held to the sun shade with an adhesive. A discrepancy report was written during qualification testing of the sun shade because the adhesive would not hold during pull test. Lunar surface photographs verified separation occurred between the sunshade and Velcro cemented to the sunshade. For Apollo 17 it is directed that stiching or brads be added to prevent this occurence&quot;]</i></blockquote>
169:21:32||alsj|John doesn't tell us if he actually removed the sunshield and saw that the Velcro adhesive had failed or if the sunshield was merely loose.  The fact that Charlie dropped the sunshield into the dust at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvload.html#1201819" target="new" target="alsj">120:18:19</a>, just prior to installing it on the camera, may be relevant. This incident is not discussed in the Apollo 16 Mission Report.
169:21:32||alsj|After John parks the Rover at the VIP site, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.vip.html#1703052" target="new" target="alsj">170:30:52</a> Tony asks him to remove the sunshield and throw it away.
169:21:32||alsj|The ALSEP Central Station comes into view.  Stone Mountain is in the background.
169:22:03||alsj|Fendell is now centered on the 2-meter boulder.  Note the foreground Rover track.  Here, we can see the edges on the shallow impression made by the Rover wheels.
169:22:18||alsj|Charlie is trying to read his camera settings to take &quot;before&quot; photos of the rake site but, because he is already in position to take a down-Sun and is facing west, the camera is in his own shadow.
169:22:24||alsj|During the following transmission, Charlie changes his camera settings because, after taking the down-Sun, he is about to take a cross-Sun &quot;locator&quot; of the Rover.  As shown in the &quot;Standard Sampling Photos&quot; part of Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lsp192.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">3.3-1</a> in the Apollo 16 Final Lunar Surface Procedures, the down-Suns were taken at f/11 and the cross-Suns were taken at f/8.
169:22:31||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun is  AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18824" target="new" target="alsj">18824</a>.]
169:22:31||alsj|John's cross-Sun stereopair from the south is AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18681" target="new" target="alsj">18681</a>and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18682" target="new" target="alsj">18682</a>.]
169:22:31||alsj|Charlie's &quot;locator&quot; of the Rover is AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18825" target="new" target="alsj">18825</a>, which is also an excellent picture of John.]</i></blockquote>
169:22:43||alsj|As Fendell continues to pan, John and Charlie come into view northwest of the Rover.  John has his back to us and is undoubtedly holding a sample bag open.  Charlie is standing north of him and has the rake head up at waist height.  He is examining the fruits of his first swath.
169:23:20||alsj|Charlie pours the samples into the bag.  Fendell continues the TV pan.
169:24:03||alsj|They have been having trouble with the sample bag holders on the cameras and John has been holding a pack in his hand.  Here, he needs to seal the rake-sample bag and needs to have Charlie hold the unused bags.
169:24:03||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.
169:24:13||alsj|At this point, John is probably putting the rake sample in Charlie's SCB.
169:24:37||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie as he backs up to get his shadow off the sample area.  John takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; from the south, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18683" target="new" target="alsj">18683</a>.] </i></blockquote>
169:24:38||alsj|As shown in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, John and Charlie did Station 10 about 30 meters east of the 2-meter boulder.
169:24:52||alsj|Charlie has been holding a pack of sample bags in his right hand.  He comes over to John and gives him the bags.
169:24:54||alsj|Charlie twists the rake so he can drag the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tools/judy38.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">solid, side portion</a> through the soil to get the soil sample.
169:25:01||alsj|Charlie raises the rake and pours the soil sample into a bag John is holding.
169:25:14||alsj|The rake is mounted on the extension handle, which Charlie will need to do the double core.  As Judy Allton indicates in Table 6 of her &quot;Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools and Containers&quot;, John and Charlie have two extension handles.  The scoop is currently attached to the other handle and is probably mounted on the back of the Rover at the present moment.  Charlie could use either extension handle to do the double core, but the point is that, to get a soil sample he will need the rake and there is no point in doing the double core before he finishes with the rake.
169:25:16||alsj|Charlie steps toward John and takes the unused bags so John can seal the soil sample.
169:25:25||alsj|After spinning the bag closed, John steps to Charlie's right side and puts the soil sample in his SCB.
169:25:50||alsj|John's cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; of the soil sample is AS16-116-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18684" target="new" target="alsj">18684</a>, taken from the south.
169:25:59||alsj|John takes the rake.
169:26:01||alsj|Charlie gets into position to bob down to get the gnomon.
169:26:06||alsj|Charlie backs away from the gnomon.  Recall that the gnomon staff came off earlier in the mission and, in order to retrieve the gnomon, he would have to get down to within a few inches of the ground and grab the legs.  Throughout the mission, John has had a much easier time getting low to the ground and is confident that he can retrieve the gnomon and then place it at the double core site wherever he wants.  See the discussion following <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new" target="alsj">119:24:37</a>.
169:26:13||alsj|John bobs down and grabs the gnomon easily with his right hand.
169:26:18||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right and John goes off to the left.  Fendell decides to pan left.
169:26:21||alsj|In Houston, Flight is being told that telemetry is indicating that roll indicator on the ALSEP mortar package is off-scale.  Experiments wants the crew to make sure the mortar package is actually level.
169:27:13||alsj|Fendell finds John and Charlie, who are about 30 meters from the Rover.
169:27:22||alsj|John puts the gnomon on the ground.
169:27:22||alsj|Fendell zooms in as Charlie gets into position to take a down-Sun &quot;before&quot; and John gets ready to take a cross-Sun from the south.
169:27:44||alsj|Charlie's down-Sun is AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18826" target="new" target="alsj">18826</a>. In a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16det18826.jpg" target="new" target="alsj">detail</a>, note the dirt John kicked forward as he took a step with his right foot. Most of the particles have moved out the same distance from his boot.  In the wider view, note the rougher texture of the surface where John and Charlie have walked.  John's <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../omega.html" target="new" target="alsj">watch</a> is set on Houston time and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16watch18826.jpg" title="detail" target="new" target="alsj">reads 1:20 or 1:21</a>.   A transcript time of 169:27:30  corresponds to 1:21:30 on 23 April 1972.  Transcript times are known to have absolute uncertainties of a minute or more, so the agreement is quite satisfactory.   In the distance, just under the corner of John's PLSS, we see the warning flag on the mortar pack.]
169:27:44||alsj|John's cross-Sun stereopair is AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18685" target="new" target="alsj">18685</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18686" target="new" target="alsj">18686</a>.  John steps to his left between the frames.]
169:27:44||alsj|Charlie goes around behind John and goes off-camera to the right.
169:27:51||alsj|Charlie takes a &quot;locator&quot; of John and the rake site, with the LM in the background, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18827" target="new" target="alsj">18827</a>.  After taking the picture, Charlie comes back into view and gets a bag ready while John does a swath with the rake and then shakes the soil out.]</i></blockquote>
169:28:10||alsj|Even in the TV picture it is evident that John has not gotten many rocks.  He starts a second swath.
169:28:20||alsj|John shakes the soil out of the rake.
169:28:25||alsj|Charlie steps toward John, who raises the rake to make the pour.
169:28:53||alsj|John does a third swath and shakes the dirt out.
169:28:53||alsj|The difference in fragment abundance between Station 10 and  Station 10 Prime may be a result of Station 10 Prime being on a ray and Station 10 being off it.  Alternatively, it could be a result of very  different local cratering histories.]</i></blockquote>
169:29:04||alsj|John pours the fragments into the bag.
169:29:17||alsj|John does a fourth swath and shakes the dirt out.
169:29:35||alsj|John raises the rake to do the pour.
169:29:36||alsj|As the fragment fell out of the rake, it missed the bag opening.  Charlie swiped at it with the bag to try to catch it, but missed.
169:29:54||alsj|While Charlie spins the bag to seal it, John goes around to the south side of the gnomon to take an &quot;after&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18687" target="new" target="alsj">18687</a>.] </i></blockquote>
169:29:59||alsj|John gets on the downside of a moderate slope so that his feet are hidden from us by an intervening high spot.  He bends his right knee, leans to his right, and uses the edge of the rake to get a soil sample.  Charlie gets a bag ready.  Note that he is still holding bag 349 that contains the rake sample.  John raises the rake carefully and pours.
169:30:28||alsj|John gets a second batch of soil.  For some reason, Charlie kicks his left foot vigorously to the side and sends a shower of dust flying.  He had backed up slightly a moment before and it is possible that he had stepped on a rock and is getting it out of the way.
169:30:28||alsj|John pours.
169:30:42||alsj|John backs up and takes an &quot;after&quot;, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18688" target="new" target="alsj">18688</a>.] </i></blockquote>
169:30:51||alsj|Charlie turns to his left to present his SCB.  While John stows bag 349, Charlie spins the soil sample bag to seal it.  Once it is sealed, he hands it to John, who stows it in Charlie's SCB.
169:31:13||alsj|Fendell pans right.  At maximum zoom, the camera appears to be moving faster than normal, but isn't.  Apparently, Houston has decided to try to look at the mortar package with the TV so that they won't have to bother John and Charlie with that task.
169:31:32||alsj|Fendell stops the TV just as the Central Station antenna comes into view.  The stop is so precise, in azimuth, it appears that he  knew exactly where he was going to find it.  Fendell pans down slightly to get the Central Station centered.
169:31:39||alsj|Fendell pans right in small increments, looking for the mortar package.  After the second movement, he is centered on the RTG.  The eastern edge of the 2-meter boulder is at the lower right edge of the TV picture.  A copper-colored ribbon cable runs off screen to the right toward the magnetometer.  As can be seen in Figure <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">6-13</a> in the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16psr.html" target="new" target="alsj">Preliminary Science Report</a>, Fendell is panning the wrong way.  From Station 10 Prime, the mortar package  - MPA in the figure - is to the left of the Central Station and in the foreground.
169:31:39||alsj|At about this point, John takes an up-Sun stereopair, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18689" target="new" target="alsj">18689</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18690" target="new" target="alsj">18690</a>.] </i></blockquote>
169:31:59||alsj|Fendell reverses direction and pans a short way to the left.  However, after a few seconds, he pans right again and, after two short movements, is looking over the top of the 2-meter boulder.  The magnetometer is visible past the left side.  Note the bright, white blanket of South Ray ejecta visible in the far distance over the top of the boulder
169:32:26||alsj|John takes &quot;after&quot; photographs AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18691" target="new" target="alsj">18691</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18692" target="new" target="alsj">18692</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18693" target="new" target="alsj">18693</a>.  In 691, the sample appears to have been taken from the lower right corner.  This sample is 60018, a 1.5 kg breccia which is shown in Figure 7C in the Apollo 16 Professional Paper.]
169:32:26||alsj|Fendell pans farther right and gets the magnetometer at the left edge of the TV picture.  Realizing that he isn't going to find the mortar package at maximum zoom, he pulls back.  Meanwhile, Backroom spokesman Jim Lovell tells Flight that, if the mortar package can't be located with the TV, the crew will have to delete the double core and go look at it.
169:32:50||alsj|John may have given Charlie the rake to take back to the Rover.
169:32:50||alsj|Fendell pans left and stops with the Central Station at right center.  The mortar package is the white object left of center.  The question is: does anyone in Houston recognize it?  Flight asks Lovell if the Backroom really wants to delete the double core and Lovell says that they would rather not but that it may be necessary if they &quot;can't satisfy ALSEP with the TV camera.&quot;  Tony chimes in and points out that, while Charlie does the double core, John can go over to examine the mortar package, particularly since he was the one who deployed it.  Of all the people in Houston, Tony and backup Commander Fred Haise probably understand the situation and the possibilities better than anyone.
169:33:24||alsj|One of the astronauts, possibly Charlie,  passes in front of the TV, crossing the field-of-view from left to right.
169:33:24||alsj|John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;before&quot; photos of the glass ball.  These are AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18694" target="new" target="alsj">18694</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18695" target="new" target="alsj">18695</a>.  In 694, the glass ball is above and to the right of the gnomon leg with the gray scale on it.  John then takes a &quot;locator&quot; to the Rover.  This is <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18696" target="new" target="alsj">18696</a>, which shows Charlie at the Rover.  This sample is 60135, a 138 gram, round, solid, glass-coated breccia, which is shown in Figure 14B in the Professional Paper.]
169:33:24||alsj|In Houston, someone realizes that the white object left of center in the TV picture is the mortar package and Fendell zooms in.  As he does so, the mortar package antenna becomes obvious.  After just a moment, we hear, &quot;Flight, (this is) ALSEP.  We're happy.  We've had a transducer failure.&quot;  This is one of several instances during the J missions when the TV was successfully used as a mission tool beyond its intended role as a means of gathering geologic information and documentation.  A sensor on the mortar package was telling the experimenters that the package was rolled 12 degrees away from vertical - enough to jeopardize the experiment - but the TV clearly indicates that the package is still sitting level the way John left it.
169:33:24||alsj|Fendell now pulls back on the zoom and pans right, looking for the crew.
169:33:24||alsj|The following dialog suggests that, as soon as John collects the glass ball, he joins Charlie at the back of the Rover.
169:35:08||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat and we see him screw the two core sections together.
169:35:10||alsj|Charlie goes around the back of the Rover to get the rake handle from John.  He goes off-camera to the right.
169:35:32||alsj|John likes to hear that they have time left for more sampling before they have to go back to the LM to start closeout.
169:35:32||alsj|Fendell pans right to the clockwise limit.  John is at the CDR seat at the right edge of the picture.  Charlie goes to the back of the Rover with the double core in his right hand and the rake in his left.  He pushes the rake extension handle into the mounting hardware.  He then takes the rake off the extension handle.
169:35:48||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the left.
169:35:52||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds John at the LMP seat.  Charlie is off-camera, farther left, and is getting ready to throw the rake head.
169:35:58||alsj|Charlie goes to the back of the Rover and attaches the rake extension handle to the double core.
169:36:20||alsj|Charlie will push the double core as far into the ground as he can by hand and then will hammer it in to full depth.  Charlie goes off-camera to the left and John goes around the back of the Rover to the CDR seat, carrying two fist-sized rocks.
169:36:20||alsj|For a moment, Fendell follows John but then pans left to find Charlie.
169:37:00||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie northwest of the Rover as he reaches down with his left hand to get the hammer out of his <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16ShinPocket.html" target="new" target="alsj">shin pocket</a>.
169:37:08||alsj|Charlie stands and rests while John, who is off-camera near the front of the Rover, turns and takes AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18697" target="new" target="alsj">18697</a>.   John then comes over closer and, still off-camera, takes <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18698" target="new" target="alsj">18698</a>.]
169:37:08||alsj|In Houston, the spokesman for the Backroom, Jim Lovell, tells Flight that their top sampling priority is what Charlie described, at the start of EVA-1, as a piece of basalt near the LM.  Lovell tells Flight that it is in the crater behind the LM.
169:37:21||alsj|In Houston, Lovell protests to Flight that the basalt was near the LM and not here.  Tony England explains his transmission by pointing out that Charlie had said that the rock was under the engine bell and, therefore, was inaccessible.  In the dialog, Charlie indicated this both at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1191736" target="new" target="alsj">119:17:36</a> when he first described the rock during the Rover deployment and, later, at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.debrief1.html#1282118" target="new" target="alsj">128:21:18</a> during the EVA-1 debrief.
169:37:21||alsj|Charlie steps up to the double core and hits it three times, left-handed.  The hammer turns in his hand and he stops to adjust his grip.  He then hits it seven more times before having to adjust his grip once again.  After starting again, on the second stroke, the hammer glances off the extension handle, apparently because Charlie has run into resistance at depth.  He then grabs the hammer in both hands and starts pounding.  NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.s72_33898.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-33898</a> shows Charlie driving a double core during training at the Kennedy Space Center on 22 March 1972.
169:37:50||alsj|John crosses the TV field-of-view from left to right, momentarily blocking our view of Charlie.  When we see Charlie again, he is still delivering short, sharp, two-handed blows and, after a total of about 20 blows, stops hammering.
169:38:22||alsj|John's stereopair of &quot;afters&quot; of the double core is AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18699" target="new" target="alsj">18699</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18700" target="new" target="alsj">18700</a>.  They show Charlie as he stands, resting, with his arms down at his side.  Once John takes the pictures, Charlie reaches forward and pulls the core out with some care.  He exhales sharply at one point, but doesn't sound like he's straining.  He has the core in his right hand and raises the tip, resting it on his up-raised left hand.  He then runs toward the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>
169:38:49||alsj|At the back of the Rover, Charlie holds the double core with the tip pointing straight up.  He removes the extension handle and stows it.
169:38:54||alsj|Fendell pans left.
169:40:10||alsj|No where in the transcript does Charlie mention any rocks in the crater behind the LM as being vesicular basalts.  His mention of a rock he thought might be a vesicular basalt under the engine bell is at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.lrvdep.html#1191736" target="new" target="alsj">119:17:36</a>.
169:40:10||alsj|Fendell gets the LM in view and zooms in.
169:40:10||alsj|In Houston, Lovell tells Flight that they need the core tube numbers from Charlie.  Flight acknowledges the request but Tony doesn't pass it up, apparently confident that Charlie will relay the information when he is ready.
169:40:57||alsj|With the TV at maximum zoom, we have an excellent view of the front of the Ascent Stage.  Note that the hatch is closed, but not latched.
169:42:38||alsj|Before collecting the sample, John took a cross-Sun stereopair from the north, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18701" target="new" target="alsj">18701</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18702" target="new" target="alsj">18702</a>; then an up-Sun picture, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18703" target="new" target="alsj">18703</a>; and, finally, an &quot;after&quot;, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18704" target="new" target="alsj">18704</a>.  The sample is 60019, a 1.89 kilogram breccia which is shown in Figure 8C in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>
169:43:42||alsj|Tony was probably listening to a conversation between Flight and EVA, the people who keep track of the time remaining for the completion of the various activities.  Somebody sitting with Tony evidently heard John's question and told Tony.
169:43:56||alsj|In the interest of saving time, Flight had asked <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> if it would be okay for John to drive back to the LM without switching the LCRU off.  Fendell said that wouldn't be a problem.
169:44:07||alsj|Charlie comes into view at the left side of the TV picture. As he gets close to the LM, he angles around the south side of the spacecraft, passing close to the UV camera.  If Charlie left the Rover at 169:43:51, he makes his turn to the right 49 seconds later at 169:44:40, he covered  about 70 meters at a speed of about 5.1 km/hr.  His 48-m run back to the LM from Station 10, starting shortly after <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta10.html#1492040" target="new" target="alsj">149:20:40</a>, has much more complete TV coverage than this one.  The estimated speed for that run is 4.8 km/s.  He did both runs using his loping stride and seemed to run with similar ease both times.
169:44:41||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right.  Fendell moves his aim slightly right and  finds Charlie behind the LM, looking for basalt samples.
169:44:59||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the right.  Fendell follows and finds him just as he picks up a sample with the scoop.  After a brief examination, Charlie moves farther right, probably having dropped the sample because it was a breccia.  After moving several meters, Charlie stops and moves a rock with the scoop, but then moves on again without bothering to pick it up.  Clearly, he is having no trouble recognizing breccias once he gets close enough to see the clasts.
169:46:24||alsj|John's sample is 60215, a 386-gram white breccia which is shown in Figures 15A and 15B in the Professional Paper.  Prior to sampling, John took three &quot;before&quot; photos, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18705" target="new" target="alsj">18705</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18706" target="new" target="alsj">18706</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18707" target="new" target="alsj">18707</a>.]
169:46:24||alsj|NASA photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/ap16-S72-43966.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">S72-43966</a> shows a thin-section of 60215.  Scan courtesy of Harald Kucharek.
169:46:24||alsj|Charlie has stopped to examine another rock and, this time, plants the scoop and backs up to take a cross-Sun stereopair from the north, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18828" target="new" target="alsj">18828</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18829" target="new" target="alsj">18829</a>.  He then gets the scoop, slides it under the sample, and lifts it without difficulty.  Finally, after examining the sample, he bags it.]</i></blockquote>
169:47:50||alsj|This sample is 60235, a 70-gram breccia with crystalline clasts, which are the features he described as being &quot;lath-like&quot;.  In mineralogy, laths are thin, linear structures and are characteristic of some types of rocks which crystallized from a melt and, hence, are called, crystalline.
169:47:50||alsj|Charlie spins the bag and seals it.
169:48:23||alsj|Charlie looks around and then moves off-camera to the right.  As he does, the camera moves abruptly and ends up pointing at the surface near the Rover.  After a few seconds, the Rover starts to move and we lose the TV picture.
169:48:23||alsj|TV off.
169:49:49||alsj|Charlie took three pictures of this sample, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18830" target="new" target="alsj">18830</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18831" target="new" target="alsj">18831</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18832" target="new" target="alsj">18832</a>.  The sample is 60255, an 871-gram breccia which is shown in Figures 17A and B in the Professional Paper.]</i></blockquote>
||alsj|John has just parked the Rover at the LM at the end of EVA.  As per instructions from Houston, he did not take the time to change the LCRU switch before making the drive.  Consequently, the comm signal has a lot of static.
169:51:45||alsj|John is asking Charlie to help with the high-gain alignment.  GCA is &quot;ground controlled approach&quot;.
169:53:54||alsj|TV on.  Charlie is in view at the left front of the Rover and is looking at the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LCRU.html" target="new" target="alsj">LCRU</a> <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="new" target="alsj">signal-strength meter</a>.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pans left.
169:54:23||alsj|As Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise stop, Charlie comes into view and goes to the CDR seat.  Apparently, he put John's SCB on the seat while he was helping with the antenna alignment.  He picks up the SCB and goes to the back of the Rover.
169:54:24||alsj|As Charlie goes off-camera to the left, John comes into view at the right and goes to the CDR seat.  He reaches in, gets the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new" target="alsj">dustbrush</a>, and goes out of view to the right, headed from the front of the Rover.
169:54:24||alsj|The TV picture jiggles as John dusts the front of the Rover.  Fendell pans right.  John dusts the TV lens.
169:55:20||alsj|John crosses the field-of-view from right to left.
169:55:38||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie, who is north of the LM.  He is spinning a sample bag to seal it.  He has already taken a cross-Sun stereopair of &quot;before&quot; photos from the north, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18833" target="new" target="alsj">18833</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18834" target="new" target="alsj">18834</a>.  The sample is 60275, a 255-gram, glass-coated breccia which is shown in Figures 18A and 18B in the Professional Paper.  Charlie has the scoop planted and has John's SCB standing upright nearby.]</i></blockquote>
169:56:33||alsj|Charlie goes to the SCB and leans to his left to open the top.  He drops bag 18 into the SCB  and then picks up the SCB.  He takes an &quot;after&quot;, which is AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18835" target="new" target="alsj">18835</a>.] </i></blockquote>
169:56:44||alsj|Charlie grabs the scoop, turns to his right, and heads off-camera to the left.  Fendell pans to follow and doesn't actually lose sight of him.
169:56:44||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop and hops around to a position a couple of meters north of it.
169:56:58||alsj|Charlie takes a cross-Sun stereotriplet from the north, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18836" target="new" target="alsj">18836</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18837" target="new" target="alsj">18837</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18838" target="new" target="alsj">18838</a>, stepping to his right between the first two frames but moving only slightly - perhaps not moving his feet - between the second and third.  He then gets a sample bag off his camera and opens it.]</i></blockquote>
169:57:20||alsj|Charlie gets the scoop and lifts the sample without difficulty.
169:57:50||alsj|This sample is 60315, a 788-gram crystalline rock.  In Houston, Flight says, with some satisfaction, &quot;How's that for timing, there, Experiments?&quot;
169:57:50||alsj|Charlie drops the bag.
169:58:04||alsj|Charlie plants the scoop and opens another bag.
169:58:09||alsj|John comes into view at the right side of the TV picture.
169:58:16||alsj|Charlie picks up the SCB and then throws away the unused sample bags.  He is facing the Rover and, with a flick of his right wrist, sends them sailing off-camera, to our left, in a very flat trajectory.
169:58:16||alsj|John stands and looks at his checklist, which is on his right forearm.  He is probably looking at page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3CDR46-47.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">CDR-46</a>.  He reaches across with his left hand and appears to stroke the surface of the page with his fingers.
169:58:16||alsj|Charlie grabs the scoop and heads for the LMP seat.  Fendell follows.
169:59:16||alsj|Charlie appears to throw the extension handle off-camera to the right and stands for a moment, watching it.
169:59:36||alsj|Charlie picks up SCB 7 and we watch him as he inserts a core tube into one of the internal sleeves.
169:59:52||alsj|Charlie turns to face the back of the Rover, possibly to get some light on his cuff checklist.
170:00:07||alsj|John joins Charlie at the LMP seat and bends down to release the bottom of the SCB on the right-hand side of Charlie's PLSS.
170:00:07||alsj|Ulli Lotzmann provides a <a href ="a16still1700015.jpg" title="image" target="new">TV still</a> showing John on the left with the red CDR strip on his helmet and Charlie on the right wearing John's OPS with the CDR strips on the back.
170:00:18||alsj|John now removes the SCB from Charlie's PLSS.
170:00:25||alsj|As Charlie turns, sunlight falls on the right-hand side of his helmet.  He reaches up and extends the side visor.
170:00:26||alsj|John places the SCB on the LMP seat.
170:00:37||alsj|John releases the tool harness strap from the fastening on the right-hand side of Charlie's PLSS.  He starts to go around behind Charlie, who simultaneously turns to his left to help get it unwound.  John ends up between Charlie and the LM, holding the harness.  John then presents the right side of his own PLSS so that Charlie can return the favor.  They both drift off-camera to the left.
170:01:01||alsj|John crosses the field-of-view from left to right, carrying his Hasselblad.  Charlie comes into view briefly, but with his back to us.
170:01:21||alsj|Fendell zooms in on the UV camera, which is beyond the ladder.  Charlie returns to the LMP seat and picks up an SCB.
170:01:39||alsj|Charlie takes the SCB off-camera to the right, while Fendell examines the UV camera.
170:01:39||alsj|What Charlie may be saying is that he was trying to hold too many things and, without thinking, brought something up toward his mouth so he could hold it with his teeth.  His helmet, of course, got in the way.
170:01:39||alsj|The TV picture jiggles as one of them works at the Rover.
170:02:24||alsj|As Fendell pulls back on the zoom, John comes into view from the right, carrying an individual sample bag toward the LMP seat.
170:02:44||alsj|John goes to the back of the Rover.
170:03:16||alsj|Fendell pans left to find John.
170:03:17||alsj|Fendell finds John as he makes his way around the north LM footpad, headed for the east footpad.  He stops there for a moment and then continues around to the south side of the spacecraft, which is where the cosmic ray experiment is deployed.
170:03:17||alsj|At about this time, Charlie places a photo of the Duke Family on the surface and takes three photos, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18839" target="new" target="alsj">18839</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18840" target="new" target="alsj">18840</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18841" target="new" target="alsj">18841</a>.]</i></blockquote>
170:03:38|Duke|alsj|'Sixty-four Charlie' (64-C) was our test pilot school class.  He and I went to test pilot school together.  The class climbed up to the top of Mt. Whitney (in California) and everybody had a ball.  And that's what I was referring to: it (meaning the exploration of the Descartes landing site) was better than the Mt. Whitney event.
170:03:38||alsj|In January 2011, Ulli Lotzmann realized that photos AS16-117-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18842" target="new" target="alsj">18842</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18843" target="new" target="alsj">18843</a> show a piece of Beta Cloth on which Charlie has written &quot;64-C&quot; to honor the third class of 1964 at the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School.  Ulli also located a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16USAF-ARPS-64C.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">photo</a> - possibily a graduation photo.  In his book </i>Moonwalker<i>, Charlie mentions that the class started with fourteen members.  The photo shows twelve pilots.  Charlie is standing, third from the left.  Al Worden (Apollo 15 CMP) is standing on the far right.  Stu Roosa is kneeling, fourth from the left.  And Hank Hartsfield (Apollo 16 Support Crew and CSM CapCom) is immediately right of Roosa. In  </i>Moonwalker<i> Charlie mentions three of the others: Sam Armstrong, who is standing on Charlie's left in the picture; Joe Wuertz, who is on Charlie's right; and Pete Hoag, who is on Al Worden's right.  I also found a bio of "Duke" Fredricks, who is on Wuertz's right at the left end of the line; and Jerry Larson, who is kneeling in front of Charlie. In a February 2011 exchange of e-mail, Charlie identified the pilot kneeling on the right as Gary Moore, but said that the class had &quot;lost track of him&quot;.  Two of the signatures remain uncertain: Floyd Stoorep(?), kneeling on the left; and "Windy" Hull, kneeling, second from the left.]
170:03:38||alsj|As Charlie mentions in his book </i>Moonwalker<i> (page 206), he also placed a medallion commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Air Force.  Photos  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18844" target="new" target="alsj">18844</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18845" target="new" target="alsj">18845</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18846" target="new" target="alsj">18846</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18847" target="new" target="alsj">18847</a> show the medallion.  Charlie mentions the Air Force Anniversary at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1701951" target="new" target="alsj">170:19:51</a> but had certainly put it out prior to <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1701142" target="new" target="alsj">170:11:42</a>.]
170:03:38||alsj|Journal Contributor John Muse helped me think about the Duke Family and medallion photo sequence.
170:03:38||alsj|Fendell is panning to the left - clockwise - looking for John.
170:04:08||alsj|Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and, not finding either John or Charlie, reverses direction.  The TV picture jiggles as Charlie works, off-camera, on the CDR's side of the Rover.
170:05:50||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie working at the CDR seat.
170:06:17||alsj|Charlie picks up the ETB and goes around the back of the Rover and off-camera.  Fendell is at the counter-clockwise pan limit.
170:06:36||alsj|Fendell pans clockwise.
170:06:38||alsj|There is some microphone noise that suggests that John tries Tony's suggestion of holding the cosmic ray experiment upright and shaking it.
170:07:19||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie, who is facing south and holding one end of the cosmic ray frame.  John is off-camera to the right and, as we watch, Charlie shakes and pulls the frame while John pulls on the 'removable' plate.
170:07:57||alsj|Off-camera, John drops his end of the frame.  Charlie takes a couple of steps toward John, probably, to put the experiment in reach.
170:07:59||alsj|Fendell pans right to get the cosmic ray experiment centered.  Charlie is at the left in the TV picture, holding the frame, and John is at the right, gripping the plate with the pliers.  The frame is roughly two meters long.  While Charlie holds the frame tightly, John pulls with the pliers and we see the plate slide out about a foot.
170:08:16||alsj|John pulls the plate out a few more inches, at which point it folds up, rather like an airplane flap.
170:08:20||alsj|John loses his grip on the experiment, leaving Charlie to control its entire weight.
170:08:25||alsj|John re-gains his grip on the experiment and Charlie walks it toward the left, John guiding, so that the frame can rest on the MESA while John works on it and Charlie goes back to his tasks.
170:08:30||alsj|Charlie goes toward the Rover but, after a few steps, stops and raises his right arm to get some sunlight on his checklist.  He then rotates his wrist, perhaps so he can look at his watch.  He goes to the LMP seat. Only the right-hand side of his PLSS is visible.  John is at the MESA with his back to us.
170:08:44||alsj|John has just looked at a patch called a tempa-label.  It has a series of spots which change from white to black at successively higher temperatures.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.
170:09:08||alsj|Charlie turns to his left slightly, undoubtedly to get some sunlight on his checklist.
170:09:30|Jones|alsj|Were you planning to run the 16-mm camera when you were doing the Descartes Olympics?  What was the Descartes Olympics?
170:09:30|Duke|alsj|Well, we was (sic) just going to screw around, really,  You know, Dave had been able to drop the hammer and the feather and we were going to do the Descartes Olympics because it was an Olympic year.  John was supposed to do a long jump and I was going to do a high jump - which I ended up doing and falling over backwards and that really got my attention.  But I didn't remember that we told anybody about that, but I guess it was in there somewhere.
170:09:30||alsj|We looked at the checklist.
170:09:30|Duke|alsj|(Reading) 'LRV placement and Grand Prix.'  I don't remember us supposed be having a Grand Prix.  'LCRU, switch 1; plus and minus 15 volts, DC prime; perform Grand Prix; reset Nav as follows: 085...'  But I said an Olympics.
170:09:30||alsj|The &quot;Grand Prix&quot; entry was probably a contingency in case they hadn't been able to do the Grand Prix early.  We found nothing in the checklist indicative of the Descartes Olympics.  See, however, the note at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1702033" target="new" target="alsj">170:20:33</a>.
170:10:04||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the left, going to the left side of the MESA.
170:10:23||alsj|Charlie reaches down to get the pliers, which appear to be attached to the left side of John's suit at, or just below, waist level.
170:10:31||alsj|John steps to his right, away from Charlie, who is still trying to free the pliers.
170:10:31||alsj|John goes to the right end of the MESA, leans to his right - perhaps even kneeling - and reaches into the ETB.
170:11:01||alsj|Charlie goes off-camera to the left.  John rises and brings the detector bag to the center of the MESA and starts to bag the detector plates.
170:11:20||alsj|Fendell pans left to find Charlie.
170:11:38||alsj|Charlie takes four documentary photos of the SWC prior to retrieving it.  These pictures are AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18848" target="new" target="alsj">18848</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18849" target="new" target="alsj">18849</a>, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18850" target="new" target="alsj">18850</a>, and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18851" target="new" target="alsj">18851</a>.]
170:11:38||alsj|In frame  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18849" target="new" target="alsj">18849</a>, the bright/white area on the surface just up-Sun of the staff is undoubtedly a diffuse reflection of the Sun.] </i></blockquote>
170:12:27||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie beyond to the U.S. Flag.  He has the SWC staff and has it raised at shoulder height, getting ready to throw it like a javelin.
170:12:32||alsj|Charlie throws the javelin from left to right.  He imparts a slight rotation as he releases it and, as it goes off-camera to the right, it is traveling horizontally but it pointing at the ground. It looks to me that it would have travelled about 20 meters.
170:12:36||alsj|Charlie heads for the Rover, carrying the SWC sheet.  He uses a sideways hopping motion, leading with his left foot.  He may be doing this to keep the SWC sheet in the sunlight as he tries to roll it up more completely.
170:12:38||alsj|Fendell has been panning to the right to try to keep Charlie in view.  But, as Charlie gets close to the Rover, Fendell can't keep up and Charlie goes off-camera to the right.
170:13:04||alsj|As Fendell continues to pan to the right, the javelin comes into view.
170:13:28||alsj|A tempa-label has a series of spots which change color from white to black at successively higher temperatures.    A detail from Apollo 13 training photo <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tempa-label.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">70-H-103</a> (scan by Frederic Artner) shows a tempa-label on the handle of a fuel-transfer tool.
170:13:28||alsj|Fendell finds Charlie at the left side of the MESA.  As per <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-27.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-37</a>, he has put the SWC sheet in a special bag that was stowed in the MESA and is closing that bag.  Charlie moves to the Rover where he will put the SWC bag in the ETB (Equipment Transfer Bag). Fendell pans right and finda John at the right side of the MESA with his back to us. and Charlie at the LMP's LRV seat.
170:14:04||alsj|John turns toward the MESA and Charlie goes to the back of the Rover to get the penetrometer drum. Fendell follows Charlie.  John  joins Charlie at the back of the Rover to  get a rock bag off the gate.
170:14:20||alsj|A bag can be seen hanging from the Apollo 17 ladder hook behind the lefthand side of the bottom rung in AS17-134-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/AS17-134-20482.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">20482</a>.
170:14:20||alsj|We see Charlie remove the penetrometer drum.
170:14:32||alsj|Charlie goes behind John on his way to his set so he can put the drum in the ETB.
170:14:39||alsj|Fendell follows
170:15:07||alsj|Charlie picks up a rock bag he had in the footpan.
170:15:38||alsj|John goes behind the Rover and out of the field-of-view to the right.  Charlie stands behind the Rover, in view, and adjusts his Hasselblad.
170:15:59||alsj|I originally thought that Charlie took two pictures of John at this point, AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18852" target="new" target="alsj">18852</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18853" target="new" target="alsj">18853</a>.  However, those two pictures show John at the LMP seat and, at this point, John is somewhere on the other side of the Rover.  Charlie actually takes the pictures at about 170:17:37.  My thanks to Andy Chaikin for helping me get it right.]
170:15:59||alsj|While Charlie waits for John, he decides to report the cotents of the ETB as per the last line on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16eva3LMP-27.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LMP-37</a>.
170:16:38||alsj|Fendell pans left and finds Charlie at the MESA.

170:16:38||alsj|John comes into view carrying a rock at appears to be about 25 cm across.  This is sample </i></blockquote>
170:17:04||alsj|John takes the rock to the LMP seat.  We can see Charlie putting something - probably the Cosmic Ray Experiment - into the ETC, which is hanging from the front edge of the MESA.  For the next few minutes, John will be working with the film cassettes from the UV Astronomy Camera.
170:17:33||alsj|Charlie hasn't yet put the Mag 117 into the ETB and is probably reporting what the frame count will be after he takes two pictures of John, who is still working at the LMP seat.  Charlie goes out of the field-of-view to the right to get the two pictures of John
170:17:40||alsj|John turns to face Charlie, who takes AS16-117- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18852" target="new" target="alsj">18852</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18853" target="new" target="alsj">18853</a>.  These are the last useful frames on the magazine.

170:18:09||alsj|Charlie has returned to the MESA.  He removes Mag Foxtrot/117 from the Hasselblad and puts the magazine in the ETB.  John to the ladder and puts something down.  He then turns toward Charlie and examines his cuff checklist.
170:18:32||alsj|Charlie throws the Hasselblad he was working with off camera to the left.
170:19:00||alsj|At some point prior to driving out to the VIP site, John takes a picture of the UV camera, AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18708" target="new" target="alsj">18708</a> and one that shows Charlie working at the Rover, <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18709" target="new" target="alsj">18709</a>.] </i></blockquote>
170:19:35||alsj|John has been turning and reading checklist pages to make sure he hasn't forgotten anything.
170:19:41||alsj|John goes around the back of the Rover to his seat and Carhlie follows him.
170:20:08||alsj|Fendell has panned to the clockwise limit and finds John at at his Rover seat.  Charlie comes into view from the right and goes to the back of the Rover.
170:20:08||alsj|Note that Charlie has to have put out the Air Force medallion sometime before he put Mag Foxtrot in the ETB.  Perhaps he has just moved it.  John puts his Hasselblad on his RCU bracket.
170:20:32||alsj|John rubs something on his left wrist.  He may be examining an abraded surface.
170:20:32||alsj|The EVA started at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva3prep.html#1653116" target="new" target="alsj">165:31:16</a>, so they are about 4 hours 50 minutes into the EVA.  That suggests that Charlie's watch - or at least the stopwatch function - hasn't been operating for about 35 minutes.
170:20:32||alsj|&quot;Astro Actions&quot; may be a cryptic reference to the Descartes Olympics.
170:21:09||alsj|John reaches into the cloth-lined enclosure under one of the seats and pulls out the dustbrush.
170:21:12||alsj|John brushes off his checkist.  Charlie is still at the back of the Rover.
170:21:31||alsj|John will make a final set of magnetometer reading at the VIP site and will need the dustbrush to clean both the LPM and the Rover.  Charlie goes toward the LM, out-of-view to the left.
170:21:37||alsj|John grabs either the back of his seat or the geopallet behind it with his right hand and starts a series of four jumps, getting higher with each one and letting go of the Rover near the top of each jump after the first.  He does the fourth one with his hand completely off the Rover.  On this jump, he is off the ground for about 1.85 seconds which, on the Moon, means he reached a height of 0.69 meters or 2.3 feet.  Before he finishes his next transmission, he does another jump from a spot a bit closer to the TV and is off the ground for about the same length of time.
170:21:57||alsj|John has moved behind the Rover and, immediately after saying &quot;They threw that out," does a final jump that may be the highest of the series, although not higher by more than a few centimeters.  Because he is mostly hidden by the Rover, timing of this jump is more uncertain that the prior jumps.
170:22:08||alsj|As John completes his last jump, Fendell pans left and finds Charlie, who does a short  jump and then tries a big one.
170:22:08||alsj|In his book, </i>Moonwalker<i>, Charlie says "I decided to join in and made a big push off the moon, getting about four feet high.  'Wow!', I exclaimed.  But as I straightened up, the weight of my backpack pulled me over backward.  Now I was coming down on my back.  I tried to correct myself but couldn't, and as my heart filled with fear I fell the four feet, hitting hard - right on my backpack.  Panic!  The thought that I'd die raced across my mind.  It was the only time in our whole lunar stay that I had a real moment of panic and thought I had killed myself.  The suit and backpack weren't designed  to support a four-foot fall.  Had the backpack broken or the suit split open, I would have lost my air.  A rapid decompression, or as one friend calls it, a high-altitude hiss-out, and I would have been dead instantly.  Fortunately, everything held together.
170:22:08||alsj|In a slow-motion replay of Charlie's jump, his backward rotation is clearly visible.  He may have reached a height of 0.81 meters or 2.7 feet.  As he comes down, he is leaning back as much as 20-30 degrees and, although he lands on his feet, he can do nothing to stop falling backwards onto his PLSS.
170:22:32||alsj|Although Charlie is hidden by the Rover while he tries to get up, when John does give him a hand and he rises, it does appear that he was still facing up.
170:22:44||alsj|We see the Rover shake as John stands beside the Rover, facing forward, grabs hold of something, jumps up, and pulls himself  sideways into his seat.  The Tv camera is aimed such that we see his right shoulder and part of his PLSS as he settles into the seat.
170:22:46||alsj|John doesn't wait for an answer but swings his legs out of the Rover, pushing himself upright, possibly off the outboard handhold.  Fendell started panning right as John moves but doesn't quite keep up enough to show us the dismount in detail.
170:23:06||alsj|TV off.
170:24:48||alsj|We can hear Charlie breathing as he takes equipment up the ladder to the porch.
170:26:51||alsj|The &quot;gotcha lens&quot; is, of course, the TV camera lens.  Journal Contributor John Pfannerstill notes that the acronym for the Ground Controlled Television Assembly, GTCA, was commonly pronounced &quot;gothcha&quot;.  In 2000 correspondence, Tony confirms that his use of &quot;gotcha&quot; was probably a play on both the acronym and the crew's feeling that the TV was watching them whenever they made a mistake.
170:27:49||alsj|An <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LRVFinalParking.html" target="new" target="alsj">analysis</a> of mission photographs of the LM taken here at the final parking place and elsewhere indicates that the Rover is a bit closer than John's estimate and is about 81 meters from the LM.
170:29:22||alsj|On Apollo 16, John and Charlie drove 26.7 km and used 98.2 Ah, for an average of 3.67.  This figure is much higher than usage during Apollos 15 and 17, which  was 1.67 and 1.59 amp-hours/km, respectively.  However, the Apollo 16 Mission report indicates that abnormal drainage from Battery 1 was noted during EVA-2. John and Charlie don't give regular amp-hour readings but the few we have indicate big drops during both EVA-2 and EVA-3.

170:31:05||alsj|Although the sunshield has not been seen in the field of view at any time, there may be a concern that it could get in the field-of-view and/or disturb the camera while <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> pans upward to follow the LM ascent.</i></blockquote>

Charlie is running out there now and, later, both he and John will run back.  A running astronaut kicks a great deal of dirt as he goes, spraying it in a fan, primarily a forward direction.  This can be seen best in the video of Gene Cernan's work east of the Rover at Apollo 17 Station 4 at about <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../a17/a17.sta4.html#1454821" target="new" target="alsj">145:48:21</a>.

170:35:25||alsj|TV on.  Charlie is in the field-of-view on the right.
170:35:57||alsj|Charlie may have already taken a pair of  cross-Suns of this rock:  AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18710" target="new" target="alsj">18710</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18711" target="new" target="alsj">18711</a>.] </i></blockquote>
170:36:02||alsj|It is currently 20:30 Universal Time on April 23, 1972.  At the Descartes landing site, Earth is very close to the zenith and is less than one-quarter illuminated.  The sunlit portion includes all of South America except Argentina and the bulge of Brazil and portions of the Caribbean and the western Atlantic.

It is described in detail on pages 97-105 in the <a rhef="a16sampcat.html" target="new">Apollo 16 Sample Catalog</a>.
170:36:54||alsj|With the warning flag in the raised position, the Rover instrument console will absorb more sunlight than normal.  As becomes evident in a few moments, Houston is concerned about keeping the console from getting too hot.
170:37:06||alsj|Charlie's cross-Sun stereopair of the LPM rock are probably AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18712" target="new" target="alsj">18712</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18713" target="new" target="alsj">18713</a>.] </i></blockquote>
170:40:25||alsj|This request is another indication that Houston is concerned about the TV and communications gear overheating prior to launch.
170:40:54||alsj|John may be asking if Houston wants a picture of the front of the Rover with the thermal blanket over the LCRU.  At some point, John takes two photos of the LPM across the back of the Rover.  These frames are AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18714" target="new" target="alsj">18714</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18715" target="new" target="alsj">18715</a>.]

170:45:23||alsj|Charlie is talking about the crater that John overflew by just a few meters just prior to touchdown.
170:45:23||alsj|Off-camera, John puts the rock on top of the LPM and then checks to make sure he hasn't disturbed the instrument.
170:46:09||alsj|Before he goes back to the Rover, John takes a cross-Sun stereopair of the LPM with the rock on top.  These are AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18720" target="new" target="alsj">18720</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18721" target="new" target="alsj">18721</a>.] </i></blockquote>

170:47:21||alsj|John describes the scene without actually saying what he thinks Charlie is doing.
170:49:29||alsj|Charlie selected the rock at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.vip.html#1703616" target="new" target="alsj">170:36:16</a>.

170:49:29|H&ouml;rz, from a 29 March 2003 e-mail|alsj|I was in the science 'backroom' during this EVA and needless to say: I was pleased that the crew thought of me in person. The rock itself is one of many glass-draped rocks that were returned from Apollo 16, many more than all other missions combined, most likely because they were fresh, uneroded/uncomminuted ejecta from the very young - only 2 million (!) years old - South Ray Crater.
170:51:02||alsj|John may be taking two last pictures on his way back to the LM.  These are AS16-116- <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18723" target="new" target="alsj">18723</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#18724" target="new" target="alsj">18724</a>.

170:53:35||alsj|Ron Creel has provided a summary ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.
171:03:23||alsj|and get it in there good.
171:03:46||alsj|Prior to climbing the ladder, John probably hooked the ETB to a lanyard (LEC or Lunar Equipment Conveyor) that he had left hanging down from the porch railing.  Now, he is pulling the ETB up to the porch and, in the next transmission, Charlie may be watching the operation out his window.
171:10:11||alsj|The next several minutes of dialog indicate that Charlie used the overhead <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../DumpValve.html" target="new" target="alsj">dump valve</a> to depressurize the cabin at the start of the EVA and he is now getting into position to put that valve in Auto.
171:11:00||alsj|A noise that sounds like cabin repressurization starts at this point but, because it continues long after repressurization ends, it must be static.
||alsj|John and Charlie are near the bottom of the left-hand column on Surface Checklist page 7-1.
171:12:17||alsj|The dialog indicates that the cabin is now repressurized.  The noise that began at the start of repressurization is still present, indicating that we are hearing comm noise.
171:12:20||alsj|They may have to turn to be able to see the circuit breaker panels.  Now that the suits are deflated, this is much easier than it would have been prior to repressurization.
171:13:30||alsj|All of the crews found it impossible to open the hatch - even just a little - unless the cabin pressure was 0.2 psi or less.  Now that the cabin pressure is about 5 psi, it would be impossible for anybody to open it.  John is amazed that someone in Houston is concerned.
171:13:55||alsj|As indicated previously, Charlie has been using the overhead <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../DumpValve.html" target="new" target="alsj">dump valve</a>, so a check of the safety on the dump valve in the forward hatch is largely superfluous.
171:16:02||alsj|Once they get hooked up to the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new" target="alsj">LM ECS</a> and to LM Comm, they will remove the PLSSs and prepare for a final equipment jettison.  They are on about 2/3rds of the way down the right-hand column on Surface Checklist page 7-1.
171:19:16||alsj|They have completed Surface Checklist page 7-1 and, next, will connect to LM Comm.
171:22:28||alsj|Public Affairs reports that the poor communications - and, by implication, Houston's inability to receive high-bit-rate data - is due, primarily to the fact that the LM high-gain steerable is unavailable and, also, because reception is through the 85-foot dish in Spain rather than the 210-foot dish at Goldstone, California.
171:22:28||alsj|Note, the times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.

171:38:35||alsj|Charlie's next transmission relates to the first item on page 7-2: &quot;Prep for Equip Jett 1&quot;
171:39:32||alsj|They are now weighing the sample containers.  They will record the weights on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16LMLS2-2.jpg" title="checklist page" target="new" target="alsj">page 2-2</a> of the LM Lunar Surface Checklist and will read them up to Tony after they finish.
171:45:20||alsj|The maximum allowable weight on the ISA is 18 pounds.
171:51:07||alsj|They are over the planned limit for samples and, in principle, would be cutting into propellant margins if they kept them all.  As Tony mentions, however, the Command Module orbit is perfectly lined up so that John and Charlie wouldn't have to apply any lateral thrust to achieve the rendezvous.  Nonetheless, the fact that Houston is taking a long time to make a decision about the over-limit samples is indicative of the pragmatic conservatism that motivated most operational decisions in Apollo.
172:09:07||alsj|Apparently they are unable to get one of John's wrist rings seated and John is suggesting that he take his helmet off and try to blow any offending just out of the connection.
172:11:40||alsj|Note, the times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.
172:18:23||alsj|They haven't started the depressurization.  Charlie is checking the valve, putting it in Auto before going to Open.  He will put it back in Auto once they get down to 3.5 psi.
172:20:46||alsj|John may be having trouble leaning over far enough to reach the handle.
172:21:28||alsj|Charlie is standing behind the hatch and is probably holding it open while they position Charlie's PLSS in the hatch opening so that John can kick it out far enough that it falls to the ground.  Charlie undoubtedly watches out his window.
172:24:49||alsj|For the next several minutes, John and Charlie struggle to get the helmets off.
172:38:40||alsj|In the original flight plan they would be preparing for an eight-hour rest period prior to the launch.  Because of the landing delay, most of the checklist items on pages 7-5 through 7-15 have been eliminated.  They are now taking care of the &quot;Post-EVA Cabin Clean-up&quot; on page 7-5 before taking care of the stowage items on pages 7-6 and 7-7.  John's next transmission takes care of the final, handwritten step on page 7-5.
172:38:40||alsj|The NASA Public Affairs commentator notes that Gene Kranz and the White Team of flight controllers are taking over LM operations from Pete Frank and the Orange Team.
172:41:47||alsj|Next, John and Charlie empty the ETB, stow the film magazines, and put cover bags - called sample containment bags - over the sample collection bags (SCBs).  These checklist items are in the right-hand column on page 7-6 and at the top of the left-hand column on page 7-7.

172:41:47||alsj|Note, the times mentioned by the PAO Commentators are 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.
173:01:21||alsj|Frank and Stacey O'Brien have provided a view ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../CAM000378.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.7Mb</a> ) of a RHSSC in a LM simulator taken in 2002 at the Cradle of Aviation Museum.  The Right Hand Side Stowage Comparment (RHSSC) is on the lower part of the side bulkhead on the LMP's side of the cabin and consists of four shelves into which various soft stowage bags have been secured.  Various other bags are secured to the sides.  A second photo ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../CAM-RHSSC.jpg"  title="image" tasrget="new" target="alsj">0.7Mb</a> ) from the O'Briens show the RHSSC in more detail. The set of items shown in the CAM photo undoubtedly differs in detail from the flown set in the Apollo 16 LM.</blockquote>
173:02:15||alsj|Referring to page 2-2, bag 7 will be stowed on the aft engine cover; bag 4 on/in the LHMS; bag 5 will go in the RHSSC (Right-Hand Side Stowage Compartment); bag 8 will go in the LHSSC; and bags 3 and 6 will go in the  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../apollo.glossary.html#ISA" target="new" target="alsj">ISA</a> (Interim Stowage Assembly).  Note that, in the on-board copy of the checklist, Charlie wrote 5 and 8 in the wrong blanks and then corrected himself with the notations &quot;RH&quot; and &quot;LH&quot;.]</i></blockquote>
173:04:57||alsj|It is currently 23:00 UT on 23 April 1972.  In California, the Moon rose above the eastern horizon about 30 minutes ago and, during this comm break, NASA switches comm from the 85-foot dish near <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../MDSCC.html" target="new" target="alsj">Madrid</a> to the 210-foot dish at Goldstone.  The comm improves dramatically.

173:20:30||alsj|For some reason, the on-board clock is 20 hours behind.
173:21:25||alsj|John writes this number near the top of the left-hand column on <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf7-10_11.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">page 7-10</a> in the Surface Checklist.
173:30:12||alsj|Mattingly's half of the following conversation will be added at a later time.
173:42:13||alsj|This is a change from normal procedures and, of course,  John and Charlie want to know the reason for the change.  Jim gives them an explanation at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1740321" target="new" target="alsj">174:03:21</a>.
173:44:13||alsj|OPS stowage is the first item under &quot;Cabin Clean-up for Launch&quot; at the top of the right-hand column on page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf7-14_15.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">7-15</a>.

173:59:34||alsj|Note that Jim did not give Charlie any time to turn to the pre-printed form for the P32/CSI pad.

174:13:56||alsj|To summarize, they will launch at about 175:43 and rendezvous with the Command Module during the first backside pass.  AOS on the first orbit will occur at about 177:15 and, shortly after that, Jim will read up the time-line changes.  Then, after docking and doffing the suits, they will begin to closeout the LM for the sleep period after the second-orbit AOS, which comes at about 179:10.
174:23:06||alsj|The ninth line of the left-hand column on page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-4_5.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-4</a> indicates that the expected range of temperatures for the rendezvous radar (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../rendradar.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">LM-9</a> photo by Randy Attwood) is +10F to +75F.  The +95F reading is out-of-range, which is why John wants to verify that it is okay to do the radar test.

174:34:52||alsj|Charlie writes this information at the right-hand side of page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-6_7.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-7</a>.
174:47:02||alsj|Colin Mackellar has stacked about 30 frames from the LRV TV to provide a portrait of LM (<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/A16LM_PreLiftoff30StackedFrames.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">0.1 Mb</a>) at about this time.
174:48:09||alsj|In the TV from the Rover camera, we can see the rendezvous radar, on the top-front of the LM pivot upright.  More antenna maneuvers follow over the next few minutes.
174:50:16||alsj|During the next few minutes, Charlie configures the 16-mm camera mounted over his window to film the ascent, as per the last item on page 8-8.
174:52:07||alsj|Next, John and Charlie configure the circuit breakers and various switches and valves for the launch.  The long list of items is given on pages <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-10_11.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-10-11</a> and <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-12_13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-12</a>.
174:56:02||alsj|Charlie is simply letting Houston know where he and John are in the checklist.
175:00:26||alsj|Houston had acquisition-of-signal from the Command Module, which has completed about one-quarter of its 52nd orbit.
175:01:29||alsj|In his next transmission, Charlie is asking about the procedure change Jim read up about the final moments of rendezvous.
175:04:39||alsj|Note that Houston does not give them an explanation of this anomaly prior to launch.  However, the fact that they won't be using RCS System A means that the lights are on is only of academic interest.
175:05:29||alsj|As usual, Houston is going to monitor the Commander's heart rate during the ascent.
175:05:42||alsj|The switchover from the use of descent-stage consumables to ascent-stage consumables that Charlie is about to report is covered in the first paragraph at the top of Surface Checklist page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-12_13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-12</a>.
175:11:12||alsj|John is telling Houston that all of the tank valves in the Descent Stage are open.  This procedure ensures that there is no pressure in any of the tanks and no chance of any dynamic tank response to the launch of the Ascent Stage.  These procedures are in the bottom paragraph on page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-12_13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-12</a>.
175:12:40||alsj|This is the &quot;Guidance Recommendation&quot; indicated near the middle of page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-12_13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-13</a>.
175:19:48||alsj|The normal valve position, as indicated near the middle of page <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16surf8-12_13.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">8-12</a> is Auto.
175:21:43||alsj|John will activate a small <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../tnD7141ApPyrotchnc.html" target="new" target="alsj">explosive charge</a> which will open a valve to allow pressurized helium to flow from the helium tank into propellant tank 1.  He will then repeat the procedure for tank 2.
175:23:42||alsj|I have begun to add material from the NASA transcript of the on-board recording.  Speaker indentification can not be checked until we obtain a copy of the recording.
175:26:52||alsj|Journal Contributor Danny Ross Lunsford called attention to this exchange and the follow-up below at 175:28:50.
175:29:00||alsj|In response to an October 2007 e-mail about John's momentary eye trouble, Charlie Duke wrote, &quot;The suit loop was not that spiffy in the cooling arena, so maybe we did sweat. We had been working steadily. Can't remember if we had the LCG's plugged in.&quot;  The LM Lunar Surface Checklist indicates that for at least an hour and a quarter before liftoff - and probably much longer - the circuit breaker for the LCG Pump was open, so they were definitely not getting any water cooling.
175:29:35||alsj|Journal Contributor David Woods suggests that the most likely source of light shining in John's eyes would have been reflections off the instrument panel that were directly lit by the Sun through the overhead, rendezvous/docking window.  At the time of liftoff (0127 GMT 24 April 1972), the Sun in 50 degrees above the eastern horizon on an azimuth of 077 (13 degrees north of East).  Based on a <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16comp18299-309.jpg" title="image comparison" target="new" target="alsj">comparison of post-landing, down-Sun photos</a> that John and Charlie took out the windows about 2 hours after landing, the LM is facing an azimuth of about 264 (6 degrees south of west) and the azimuth in the opposite direction is 084.  Consequently, at lifoff the Sun's azimuth (079) is about 5 degrees north of being directly behind the LM.
175:31:44||alsj|In the TV image, the horizon is tilted down to the right.  <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new" target="alsj">Fendell</a> does not have the TV at mazimum zoom and has it positioned so that the plus-Y (north) footpad is at the bottom of the frame.  Consequently, he has a lot of frame above the LM to help capture liftoff.
175:31:44||alsj|Because of the time delay in getting commands to the camera, Fendell had to tell the camera to begin tracking upwards slightly before ignition.  The camera begins to track about 2 seconds after ignition.  The LM stays in the field-of-view for about 6 seconds but, in part because John parked only 80 meters from the LM, the camera can't be panned fast enough during these early stages to keep the LM in sight.  As the LM gains altitude and, after pitchover, begins to move westward, the camera catches up.
175:31:44||alsj|Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that the rear panels on the Ascent stage can be seen to buckle during the first few seconds of liftoff.  See the discussion for AS16-122-<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/images16.html#19533" target="new" target="alsj">19533</a>.
175:31:53||alsj|The LM goes out of the TV field-of-view at about 175:31:55.
175:31:55||alsj|<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-2.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">John's heart rate</a> increased briefly to 105 beats per minute during liftoff, but quickly returned to the 80-90 beats per minute range that he'd shown during most of <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16mrf10-5a.jpg" title="image" target="new" target="alsj">EVA-3</a>.
175:32:02||alsj|Fendell finds the LM at about 175:32:04 and keeps it in the field-of-view for about 9 seconds before it drifts out the lower-left corner.
175:32:42||alsj|Fendell regains the LM at about 175:32:47, loses it again after about 2 seconds, then regains it at about 175:32:55 and keeps it in view until it becomes too faint to be seen at roughly 175:33:30.
175:32:56||alsj|More on-board material will be added at a later date.
175:33:52||alsj|After the LM becomes too faint to be seen in the Rover camera, Fendell pans down until the camera is once again looking at the horizon at about 175:33:48.
175:33:52||alsj|Journal Contributor Henning Conrad has noticed that, in a comparison between pre- and post-liftoff TV images of the LM ( <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16_ascent-animation2.gif" title="two-frame animation" target="new" target="alsj">0.3 Mb, animated gif</a> ), it is quite evident that the footpads were pressed farther into the surface by the significant downward impulse that came with liftoff. On the left-hand side, the minus-Y (south) footpad has been slightly depressed and the footpad seems to have been displaced outward. There appear to be changes in the minus-Y secondary struts consistent with that outward displacement. Also, the minus-Y probe moves a small amount between frames. On the right-hand side, the plus-Y (north) footpad is clearly displaced downward by roughly one third of the footpad height. The footpad width is 94 cm. The height as measured in AS12-46-6779 is about 12 cm. Consequently, the downward displacement is about 4 cm. I don't see any indication of outward motion of the footpad or flexing of the secondary strut. However, the plus-Y probe does move much more than the minu-s-Y probe.  Note: The 'before' image was captured sometime before <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/#1745407" target="new" target="alsj">174:54:13</a>, when Ed Fendell raised the TV camera slightly in preparation for tracking the ascent.
175:39:08||alsj|These are the velocity residuals - the differences from the planned orbit - on the three axes in feet per second.
175:40:48||alsj|Note, the time Jim Irwin reads up is 11 minutes 48 seconds later than the corresponding transcript times because of a clock update in Houston at <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html#1180631" target="new" target="alsj">118:06:31</a>.  Consequently, John and Charlie will start the tweak burn at 175:42:17 transcript time
175:48:56|Jones|alsj|But they did bring you home a day early.
175:48:56|Duke|alsj|Yeah, that's because they got nervous, I think, because, if the engine didn't work and we had a problem it gave them another, extra day, of consumables and stuff to try to figure out what was what.  The more you waited up there - if you did have a problem - the less time you had to think of something brilliant to fix it.  They got a little nervous and brought us home a day early, I think, just to make sure we could have some ample time to fix any problems.
