-01:30:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-minus 1 hour, 30 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. Just seconds from now a final gemsphere release will be made. A gemsphere is a weather balloon which measures the winds aloft. However, we don't anticipate any problems with any type of weather this morning. The spacecraft checkout is continuing ahead of schedule according to the test conductor Skip Chauvin. The cabin purge has been completed and the spacecraft pressurized with a 60-40 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. This mixture is similar to air, is pressurized slightly above the ambient pressure and then the crew checks for any possible decay in that pressure. This ensures that we've had a proper seal with the hatch, which came closed earlier and that we have no spacecraft leaks. These activities continuing at this time.

During these checks the signal is sent to receivers aboard the 3 stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. This receiver is connected to destruct packages aboard the vehicle. If the vehicle should stray off path due to a malfunction, the Range Safety Officer could elect to send signals by way of these receivers to the destruct package, This would be done only after the astronaut crew, of course, had executed their abort and were well away from the vehicle. During these tests, the signals are sent with the destruct packages in an unarmed condition. It's a check to ensure that the signals are reaching the destruct packages or, at least for the test, reaching the receiver. The swing arm is now in the 12-degree position, or parked position. The astronaut crew aboard the spacecraft now, in an emergency situation, could use their Launch Escape Tower to clear themselves well away from the spacecraft, in an emergency - from the space vehicle in an emergency.

000:24:42|T|CMP|I'm gonna keep my plat - platform way over standard.
000:25:02|T|CMP|Okay. Tell you what, gang. Could you tell me that our oxygen flow looks good?
000:25:07|T|CDR|I couldn't tell you nothing.
000:25:08|T|LMP|Yeah, it does.
000:25:09|T|CMP|Okay. The [oxygen] flow is less than 0.2 [pounds per hour] or something like that?
000:25:15|T|LMP|No, it's about 0.3.
000:25:16|T|CMP|Okay, and how's the cabin pressure?
000:25:17|T|LMP|Cabin pressure's holding at 5 - about 5 1/2 (psi, 34 -38 kPa)]. Okay, let me get that. We have the Canaries <a href="acron.html#los">LOS</a>. Let me do what I'm supposed to do here at Canaries. Getting ready to flow.

000:27:50|T|CMP|[Laughter] Hey, if you pull your helmet off, it's gonna go.
000:27:54|T|CDR|Where does it go?
000:27:56|T|CMP|Straight up [Laughter].
000:27:57|T|CDR|Did you shut your air off?
000:27:58|T|CMP|Yeah, but there's still just as much Delta-P in ... [laughter] it ... my nose, I couldn't even see it.
000:28:05|T|CDR|Well, pull your glove off first.
000:28:07|T|LMP|Can you - can you shut my flow off ..., Ken?
000:28:09|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Here comes your flow off, now.

000:28:53|T|LMP|Yeah, I know it. I'm trying to avoid that, John.
000:28:56|T|CDR|Course it's guarded.
000:29:00|T|CMP|I keep forgetting you have to hold things.
000:29:04|T|LMP|Well, for some reason, I want to float right up against the instrument panel. Maybe my - maybe it's my helium in my suit.
000:29:12|T|CDR|You want your old dinner bag there, Ken?
000:29:14|T|CMP|Yes, sir; thank you now.

000:29:20|T|CDR|That's got to be the world's greatest thing.
000:29:23|T|Unidentified|[Laughter]
000:29:28|T|CDR|I hate to tell you this, you guys. John's got to go potty.
000:29:31|T|LMP|No, this thing won't fit [Laughter].
000:29:34|T|CMP|Oh, you're kidding me - I hope.
000:29:37|T|LMP|I can't get out of -
000:29:39|T|CMP|I guess I'd better get on with that P52.
000:29:43|T|CDR|Yeah, I guess - Have you jettisoned the covers, Ken?
000:29:45|T|CMP|No. I - I was trying to move too slow, I think.
000:29:47|T|CDR|Okay.
000:29:48|T|CMP|I'm gonna do that next, and then I'll get this stuff. I'll do it.
000:29:51|T|CDR|It's 29 minutes, so we got plenty of time.
000:29:53|T|CMP|Yeah, it won't take long.
000:29:54|T|CDR|What - what all is in the checklist to do between now and tonight? Anything?
000:29:58|T|LMP|No. No, wait a minute. Let me get this thing. There you go ... it back, naturally.
000:30:04|T|CDR|Oh, come on. My goodness sakes.
000:30:07|T|LMP|[Laughter]
000:30:08|T|CDR|... the optics coming around?
000:30:10|T|CMP|I figured I was gonna - I stuck Tool E in here where I've been keeping it. And it floats out. I thought I'd just started off the mission by losing Tool E.

I know you're not, and I assure that the people of this country aren't bored and if you went out in the vicinity of the Cape and looked around today you'd probably find the biggest crowd with more people enthusiastic about the space program than we've ever seen before. And, I want you to know that the administration's interest has not diminished and as Chairman of the Space Council mine continues to accelerate as I look forward to 17 and through the Skylab launchings to follow. What's going to come after that will depend to a great extent on the continuation of your expertise and the great way you discharge your responsibilities. But you know that the people of this country still have that explorer spirit. They still have that tremendous sense of urgency for the United States to be the leader of the world in this kind of technological advance.

000:34:58|T|CMP|: Okay. I'm gonna -
000:34:59|T|CDR|I haven't got ORDEAL set up, but I got it laying here.
000:35:01|T|CMP|Can I get rid of your thing for a minute?
000:35:03|T|CDR|Sure.
000:35:04|T|CMP|Okay, there's your flow. The Optics Zero is Off -
000:35:06|T|CDR|What's the - what's the - what should we be doing?
000:35:08|T|CMP|- [Optics Speed Controller] Speed should be Lo[w]; [Optics Zero?] Off.
000:35:10|T|LMP|I'm gonna turn the page here, and -
000:35:11|T|CMP|I tell you one thing you can do is - I'm going to stay in the dark here, so I can see.
000:35:15|T|LMP|Okay.
000:35:16|T|CMP|Would you copy these numbers for me?
000:35:17|T|LMP|Yeah, I'll get them for you. John, we're up to speed, as far as I know.
000:35:23|T|CMP|I haven't started unstowing stuff.
000:35:25|T|CDR|Okay, at 35 minutes.
000:35:27|T|LMP|Oh, we got to do the - we got to do the Main Reg Check, and the secondary Accumulator Quantity.
000:35:36|T|CMP|Man, I tell you what, I - There's another thruster fire.
000:35:39|T|LMP|Okay. John, you want to go to Secondary Glycol?
000:35:41|T|CMP|Okay, would you record star 23?
000:35:43|T|LMP|Okay.
000:35:44|T|CMP|Denebola.
000:35:53|T|LMP|Okay.
000:35:59|T|CMP|I don't - I flat don't think I can see a star pattern at all.
000:36:03|T|LMP|Well, I can out the front here, out the rendezvous window.
000:36:06|T|CMP|But I got a star in the sextant.
000:36:08|T|CDR|What's the name of it?
000:36:10|T|LMP|You didn't see Denebola out the big ...
000:36:12|T|CMP|Okay, I did not see a star pattern.
000:36:14|T|CDR|Shoot.
000:36:16|T|CMP|And I'm - I'm well adapted enough in that - but I - I'm sure that the cover's off because -
000:36:25|T|CDR|: You can see some stars?
000:36:26|T|CMP|Because I see flashes, and - and occasionally I can see a star, but it's just - you know, you can't miss Denebola.
000:36:35|T|CDR|Well, let me look whenever we get a chance here. ...
000:36:37|T|CMP|All right. You got any question about whether it's okay to proceed with them?
000:36:40|T|LMP|Heck, no. Go, man.
000:36:42|T|CMP|Okay. Yeah.
000:36:44|T|LMP|Hey, John?
000:36:45|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
000:36:46|T|LMP|We want - we can do a secondary glycol accumulator or loop check - leak check, if you want to.
000:36:51|T|CDR|Yeah. ... Ken ... numbers ... -
000:36:53|T|CMP|Okay, hang on a second and I will. Load it ... procedure.
000:37:01|T|LMP|This is so great.
000:37:07|T|CMP|Those optics ... are superb.
000:37:16|T|CMP|Okay, the second star is Number 30.
000:37:19|T|LMP|Okay.
000:37:20|T|CMP|Wouldn't you know. Just what I always wanted.
000:37:22|T|LMP|What's the number?
000:37:23|T|CMP|There it is. Menkent. That may not be in the sextant.
000:37:24|T|CDR|... what it is.
000:37:29|T|CMP|- By golly, there are some stars out there. One just went by ... went by. But I'm sure - and I see some of those - Gosh, it looks like the center of the sextant - or the telescope is where I'm seeing ... But this thing is - auto optics is just neat as I thought it was.
000:37:48|T|LMP|Man, I can't believe that. I just can't believe our view [laughter].
000:37:52|T|CDR|Golly, you're here.
000:37:54|T|LMP|I mean [laughter].
000:37:55|T|CDR|Twelve days from now, you won't believe it.
000:37:58|T|LMP|This is fan - You know, I just can't believe how much a thrill this is.
000:38:01|T|CDR|It's really swinging, isn't it?
000:38:02|T|LMP|Oh, man, I've waited -
000:38:03|T|CMP|I mean to tell you.
000:38:05|T|LMP|- so long for this.
000:38:06|T|CDR|Just - just look! Look at that! Just hold your cotton picking hand out there in a 70-pound pressure suit, and you ain't got nothing on.
000:38:17|T|CMP|Oh, there's -
000:38:18|T|CDR|That was a good start.
000:38:19|T|CMP|That's a good start.
000:38:20|T|CDR|There you go there, Ken, babe. Look at those torquing angles! [Laughter].
000:38:23|T|CMP|[Laughter]
000:38:24|T|CDR|Whoo, hoo, hoo!
000:38:25|T|CMP|You got those copied?
000:38:27|T|LMP|Wait, 040 -
000:38:28|T|CDR|Yeah.
000:38:29|T|LMP|- plus -
000:38:30|T|CDR|031.
000:38:31|T|LMP|Plus 031.
000:38:32|T|CDR|Plus 045.
000:38:34|T|LMP|Plus 045. I got them. Give me the DET [Digital Event Timer] and I'm ready.
000:38:38|T|CMP|Okay. I'll torque them at 40.
000:38:39|T|LMP|Okay.
000:38:40|T|CDR|Might as well ... -
000:38:41|T|CMP|Just for kicks, I'm going to do that over again.
000:38:45|T|LMP|Okay -
000:38:46|T|CDR|No, you don't, Ken -
000:38:47|T|LMP|No. Come on.
000:38:48|T|CDR|- you don't need to do it again, honest.
000:38:49|T|CMP|Okay.
000:38:50|T|CDR|You're gonna get a blue million of them.
000:38:51|T|CMP|Okay, that - that really feels good.
000:38:52|T|LMP|Yeah. ... of those ... EMP.
000:38:55|T|CDR|Because we're liable to have our torquing angles doubled the next time we did it.
000:38:58|T|CMP|That's right. I don't want to know it if it is.
000:39:00|T|LMP|Okay, John, get -
000:39:01|T|CMP|- ... torture.
000:39:02|T|LMP|Give him a -
000:39:03|T|CDR|... Tool E?
000:39:04|T|LMP|Give him a Tool E.
000:39:05|T|CDR|Okay.
000:39:06|T|CMP|Yeah. I was going to float myself along underneath there, if you -
000:39:07|T|CDR|I got the ORDEAL up.
000:39:08|T|CMP|You have? Oh, you.
000:39:10|T|CDR|[Laughter]
000:39:11|T|CMP|That's ... I - in my job. It's so easy to do. Too late. [Laughter] Oh, ...
000:39:20|T|LMP|You know, I do feel like I'm standing on my head.
000:39:22|T|CMP|I don't. I feel like I've been here all my life.
000:39:25|T|CDR|Yeah, that what comes with 2000 hours under your belt.
000:39:28|T|LMP|Yeah.
000:39:30|T|CDR|Okay, now I need a flashlight to see what the angle is. Okay, when do you want to do this, Charlie?
000:39:36|T|LMP|Okay, let me see. Secondary Accumulator Quantity is at 40. Go ahead, any time for 30 seconds. I'll give you a mark. Give me a mark when you open it.
000:39:43|T|CDR|Okay, going - going to Normal Right?
000:39:47|T|LMP|Yeah. Go to Normal.
000:39:48|T|CDR|Okay; 3, 2, 1 -
000:39:50|T|CDR|Normal.<img style="width: 350px; height: 263px;" alt="ECS Gauges" src="pics/ecs_twin_gauges.jpg" align="right">
000:39:51|T|LMP|Okay.
000:39:52|T|CDR|It's Normal.
000:39:56|T|CMP|You guys are screwing with my union card.
000:39:58|T|CDR|: Let me get out of your way there, -
000:40:01|T|CMP|Okay. I'm gonna go play with the regulators. Okay?
000:40:04|T|CDR|Let's have a sandwich.
000:40:05|T|CMP|Hey, let's get this all cleaned up ...
000:40:06|T|LMP|Yeah, let's get it cleaned up.
000:40:08|T|CDR|It's clean as a whistle.
000:40:09|T|CMP|Oh, I want to get these regulators checked and all that stuff that I haven't done. Okay.
000:40:13|T|CDR|Say when you want to shut it off, Charlie.
000:40:14|T|LMP|They're fine [laughter]. Okay -
000:40:21|T|LMP|Mark.
000:40:22|T|CDR|Okay, going to Bypass.
000:40:23|T|LMP|Okay, it's good.
000:40:24|T|CDR|Bypass.
000:40:25|T|LMP|Loop's good. Okay, we should ... ECS, and then the Fill valve ... On.
000:40:29|T|CMP|Okay. I'm turning Main Reg B to Off.
000:40:35|T|LMP|Okay.
000:40:40|T|CMP|Emergency Cabin selector is going to One. All right. How's the flow look ...?
000:40:46|T|LMP|It's 0.2 [pounds of oxygen/hour].
000:40:47|T|CMP|Okay. gonna hit the Press To Test.
000:40:48|T|LMP|Okay.
000:40:52|T|CMP|Did you get some flow there?
000:40:54|T|LMP|A little bit, yeah.
000:40:55|T|CMP|Okay, I may have ... in ... a little long -
000:40:57|T|LMP|I think you did. I - Okay, that's it ... out.
000:41:02|T|CMP|Okay. Go back to Normal?
000:41:04|T|LMP|Not yet. Here it comes.
000:41:08|T|CMP|All right, Regulator B is coming on.
000:41:10|T|LMP|Okay.
000:41:11|T|CMP|And [Regulator] A is coming off.
000:41:14|T|LMP|Okay.
000:41:15|T|CMP|Going to number 2. ... Valve A Close, Number 2 [Emergency Cabin Pressure Selector]. Away we go.
000:41:26|T|LMP|Okay, it came up a little bit, Ken.
000:41:27|T|CMP|You want me to hold it longer?
000:41:28|T|LMP|That - no, that's fine with me.
000:41:29|T|CMP|Okay. Go back to Normal?
000:41:30|T|LMP|Yeah.
000:41:32|T|CMP|Well, I'm working mine. There's Both.
000:41:35|T|LMP|Okay, I'm going to do - We've been up here long enough. I'm gonna do the fuel cell purge -
000:41:39|T|CDR|There's - Reg A.
000:41:40|T|LMP|- And check them out.
000:41:42|T|CMP|Hey, John, do you - did you do that Secondary Leak [check]?

000:41:45|T|LMP|Fuel cell - Don't panic. I'm just testing them a little bit.
000:41:47|T|CDR|: Yeah, but still - you know.
000:41:48|T|LMP|Yeah.
000:41:49|T|CDR|I don't ... -
000:41:50|T|LMP|What the heck? I said I was going to do the fuel cell -
000:41:52|T|CDR|Yeah, I know. I knew it. I'm sorry. I don't want anything to spoil this guy now.
000:42:01|T|CMP|... Did you do the secondary leak check?
000:42:02|T|LMP|Yeah. It passed.
000:42:08|T|CMP|Yeah, so I can get number 6.

000:42:47|T|LMP|Okay, check your surge tank pres - Okay, I got that. Cryo fans, Off; on as required. Okay.
000:42:53|T|CMP|Oh, here's the nicest part of all in zero-g -
000:42:54|T|LMP|Fuel cell heaters. Okay, that's ... -

000:43:02|T|CDR|... can, too, and go back in just like downtown.
000:43:08|T|CMP|John?
000:43:09|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
000:43:10|T|CMP|May I present you with a 70-millimeter Hasselblad
000:43:15|T|Crew|[Laughter]
000:43:22|T|CDR|Oh, this is as nice as it's always been. That's all I've got to say. Just can't beat all this floating around.
000:43:27|T|CMP|But, in Gemini, you couldn't move around to enjoy it. This has got to be better than that kind of ... Phew! Can you imagine what those guys are going to do when they get in Skylab?
000:43:44|T|LMP|Well, I ain't gonna trade with them, I'll tell you that right now.
000:43:47|T|CMP|No, but they are gonna have a ball. When they get that great big volume down there.
000:43:53|T|CDR|How are we going to drink water? That's been worrying me ever since we took off. You got to keep a count of it someway or another?
000:44:01|T|CMP|Well, I don't know. I'll check and see if ...
000:44:04|T|CDR|Well, we're supposed to.
000:44:06|T|CMP|If so, it's not going to be any big deal, I can guarantee you.
000:44:10|T|LMP|Hey, how's the systems test look, 5B?
000:44:13|T|CMP|Looks good; okay.
000:44:15|T|CDR|I'm going to hang Tool E around the handle up here. Is that a good place?
000:44:17|T|CMP|Okay, just be sure -
000:44:19|T|CDR|Do you have a place it ...?
000:44:20|T|CMP|No, that'd be fine. Just be sure it's snapped wherever you put it. You know, it won't - I already made that hanging mistake once [laughter].
000:44:27|T|CDR|Yeah, well, the thing is, it's - the thing around it is really tight, this snap around it.
000:44:38|T|CDR|There must be something I have to do but I don't know what it is.
000:44:41|T|CMP|[Laughter] I think it's the ...
000:44:44|T|CDR|Golly, I mean to tell you. If this isn't gonna be the neatest thing that ever was.
000:44:52|T|LMP|[Laughter] Oh, my helmet.
000:44:53|T|CDR|Can't wait to get into that LM.
000:44:55|T|LMP|Yeah.
000:44:58|T|CDR|The thing just ... for another five minutes and 44 seconds. The pressure's all right - 48 - 38 and 18, Just exactly what they were at that other thing.
000:45:17|T|CMP|For you, my friend, if you'll pull out a - out of that little U compartment down there, the camera bracket.
000:45:24|T|CDR|I already did.
000:45:26|T|CMP|Oh, you - Oh.
000:45:28|T|CDR|Ha, ha, ha, ha. Well, I've got all these cameras, and I don't know what to do with them. It's really neat.
000:45:34|T|CMP|Here, I'll tell you what we'll do with one is raise your foot, right here, to start with. I guess we - I tell you what. You don't really need that guy right now. I can stow it back here in the -
000:45:44|T|CDR|What, the Hasselblad?
000:45:45|T|CMP|- In - no, the DAC.
000:45:47|T|LMP|Okay, John. You're supposed to do a - a GDC align.
000:45:51|T|CDR|Okay.
000:45:52|T|CMP|Here, let me stow that DAC.
000:45:53|T|CDR|No, let me just stick it on the thing. It's as good a place for it as any.
000:45:56|T|CMP|It won't be in your way ...?
000:45:57|T|CDR|No.
000:45:58|T|CMP|Okay. Why don't we - you want to set it while we're about it, then?
000:46:04|T|CDR|Yeah. The T - the -
000:46:06|T|CMP|I hadn't - I didn't set it at all yet.
000:46:09|T|CDR|T - T-8 -
000:46:10|T|LMP|Is that - is that APS mod - is that the APS module that's causing all those ... flashes?
000:46:14|T|CMP|- want a T-8, John?
000:46:17|T|CDR|T-8 at l0 feet, right?
000:46:18|T|CMP|Ten feet, 1/250 -
000:46:19|T|CDR|1/250, at 12 frames a second.
000:46:21|T|LMP|I just started the secondary coolant loop pump.
000:46:22|T|CMP|Okay.
000:46:24|T|CDR|Good, Charlie.
000:46:25|T|CMP|That's magazine AA.
000:46:28|T|CDR|Magazine AA is what's on there. How about that? Another new ... -
000:46:33|T|CMP|You're kidding me.
000:46:35|T|LMP|It's really there?
000:46:36|T|CDR|Yep.
000:46:37|T|CMP|[Laughter] Okay.
000:46:42|T|LMP|Can't believe it.
000:46:44|T|CMP|[Laughter] Okay, you got the [Hasselblad] EL, John?
000:46:45|T|CDR|The what?
000:46:47|T|CMP|You got the Hasselblad?
000:46:48|T|CDR|Yeah.
000:46:49|T|CMP|How about an f/8.
000:46:52|T|CDR|Okay, f/8.
000:46:53|T|CMP|1/250.
000:46:55|T|CDR|: Reads 250th.
000:46:57|T|CMP|And -
000:46:58|T|CDR|And infinity?
000:46:59|T|CMP|Well, why don't you take it about ten feet and go - well, put it on infinity for the time being. We might -
000:47:03|T|CDR|Okay, because as we come across the ..., we might see something. Yeah.
000:47:06|T|LMP|Okay, and that thing just gets stowed out here. Here, I - I put up my little -
000:47:12|T|CDR|: I can't do it; they put velcro right here.
000:47:13|T|CMP|- ... my goody bag.
000:47:14|T|CDR|You don't want to do that.
000:47:15|T|CMP|Oh, okay.
000:47:17|T|CDR|It can't get loose unless somebody bumps it.
000:47:19|T|CMP|Well, where did you put it?
000:47:20|T|CDR|Right there. See?
000:47:22|T|CMP|Okay.
000:47:23|T|CDR|Isn't that neat?
000:47:24|T|CMP|Okay. I've got to -
000:47:25|T|CDR|I could have nailed it right up here to this Velcro, but I don't think ... -
000:47:27|T|CMP|Well, here, I've been using this little goody bag and getting my stuff emptied out of it.
000:47:31|T|LMP|Okay, here come the TSBs you guys.
000:47:35|T|CDR|Old TSB Charlie.
000:47:36|T|LMP|It is so white and pretty.
000:47:39|T|CDR|Kind of like our suits.
000:47:40|T|LMP|: Who wants one? Ken, there's one for you.
000:47:43|T|CMP|Okay, I'll be with it in a second, as soon as I get my things put in here.

000:47:54|T|CDR|- before I leave.
000:47:56|T|CMP|I don't think there's any difference. I think it's like - like - Okay. Oh, ... I was gonna put this thing back once you get the <a href="acron.html#cmc">CMC</a> up.
000:48:17|T|LMP|Okay, John, here's one for you.
000:48:19|T|CDR|Oh, that's sure nice, Charlie. I'm sure glad you gave me that TSB.
000:48:22|T|LMP|I thought you'd like that.
000:48:24|T|CMP|Okay, how about the -
000:48:25|T|LMP|: Aren't - aren't I supposed to put some cameras and mags back in here? In U-l?
000:48:30|T|CMP|Yeah, I think that's ... yet, Charlie.
000:48:31|T|LMP|Okay. I'll leave it ... -
000:48:32|T|CMP|I'm taking one last look at my sextant - my telescope here -
000:48:34|T|LMP|Leave it at ... -
000:48:36|T|CMP|- before I screw up on it.
000:48:37|T|CDR|Oh, ho.
000:48:39|T|CMP|I got a star in it now.
000:48:40|T|CDR|Hee, hee. Hee, hee, hee. It got away from me. Come back here, you ... [laughter].
000:48:49|T|CMP|Gosh, this is mag - Oh, look at those pretty stars. Look at that. Oh.
000:49:08|T|LMP|Okay, GDC align is all we got left.
000:49:12|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I'll align the old GDC. That'll be roll 180 -
000:49:17|T|CMP|I know, I couldn't be looking at Denebola again, but -
000:49:21|T|CDR|Can you see a pattern?
000:49:23|T|CMP|Yeah, I don't recognize it. It's brighter than heck. It looked like Denebola, but -
000:49:26|T|CDR|... constellation is ...
000:49:27|T|CMP|I bet it is.
000:49:34|T|LMP|See, the horizon is beginning to light up.
000:49:46|T|CMP|Oh, and I just won me a beer.
000:49:49|T|CDR|What's that?
000:49:50|T|CMP|Well, maybe I didn't here. What's going on?
000:50:01|T|LMP|I'm turning up S-band volume for the -
000:50:03|T|CMP|: Oh-oh -
000:50:04|T|LMP|- Canaries [sic - means Carnarvon] check.
000:50:05|T|CMP|- I wonder.
000:50:06|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. We got a little roll drift in the <a href="acron.html#gdc">GDC</a> and a little yaw drift, but we don't have a heck of a lot of other, and it's - Goldang, it's been running for 50 minutes, and it's off 5 degrees in yaw - 5 degrees in yaw - and we're on Rate 2, so you don't really know. And two degrees in pitch - Heck, I'll take that. And - and 8 degrees in roll for 50 minutes. That's with the <a href="acron.html#bmag">BMAG</a>s ... That ain't really all that bad.
000:50:44|T|CMP|Oh, I can even see stars now with the reticule turned on. Is it - guess what I got? Antares!
000:50:55|T|CDR|Beautiful.
000:50:57|T|CMP|: [Laughter] It even looked like Scorpio [laughter]. Oh.
000:51:05|T|CDR|Okay, the GDC's aligned behind - to behind you at 51:05.
000:51:09|T|LMP|Mark that down.
000:51:10|T|CDR|So I get a - then I have that we're on Rate 2, BMAGs.
000:51:15|T|LMP|51:05.
000:51:16|T|CDR|Yeah, I'm gonna do some scientific research on this thing with my little pen - unless some dingaling give me a ... pen ...
000:51:31|T|LMP|Okay, I - do you want to do this reference comparison - SCS attitude reference comparison check, John?
000:51:37|T|CDR|Yeah, but I - can we do it until after we've had some -
000:51:40|T|CMP|You've got to compile them.
000:51:42|T|LMP|Oh, okay. That's right. ... be sure.
000:51:47|T|CMP|Oh, you beautiful ... You little beauty. Hoo, hoo.
000:51:57|T|LMP|Okay, there's the comm coming up.
000:52:00|T|CMP|Well, I won me a six-pack.
000:52:03|T|CDR|What's that?
000:52:04|T|CMP|I said that if I went from Manual, that the optics would drift.

001:02:07|T|LMP|Go ahead, Gordon.
001:02:09|C|Ful|Okay. I'll give you all the story on the APS module problem. Evidently APS module number 2, which is our one on top of the vehicle, the one that would cause you to pitch away from the Earth; the primary helium regulator there has failed to the backup, and the backup isn't regulating properly. Normally, it should hold around 190 psi (1310 kPa). This pressurizes both fuel and oxidizer. And it has gradually increased now up around the 320 [psi] (2200 kPa) range. And there's a relief valve which will relieve helium pressure at 325 [psi] (2240 kPa) and reseat when the pressure gets down to 225 [psi] (1550 kPa). There should be a gradual loss of helium. We'll have a better hack at the States pass as to when you could expect a deplete. But should you lose control in orbit, go to the procedure on [Page] L2-10 for Service Module RCS control of the S-IVB. Over.
001:03:11|T|LMP|Roger.
001:03:33|T|LMP|Well, Ken, you might have your work cut out for you.

001:03:46|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Go ahead.

001:04:45|T|CMP|Yeah. It doesn't have anything to do with TLI. How do we get our LM? You got your UV shade in the window, have you, Charlie?
001:04:53|T|LMP|Yes.

001:06:25|T|CMP|Well -
001:06:26|T|LMP|Then it wouldn't ...
001:06:27|T|CMP|Trouble is, there's too much backing up ... determine ...
001:06:32|T|CDR|Well, the pressurization looks good. We got to get it down. What - what he's saying really is, we got to empty some of that fuel out of there. Right?
001:06:40|T|CMP|Yeah. What do you think?
001:06:47|T|LMP|Well, like he says - it seems to me what he means is that - is that the thing's just going to deplete the helium in there.
001:07:00|T|CMP|That's ... It do seem like helium did that.
001:07:11|T|CDR|Okay, get to those procedures on that page, and tell me what they are.

001:12:31|T|CDR|Thumbwheels say 178.4.
001:12:36|T|LMP|Okay.
001:12:37|T|CDR|Pitch is 088.2.
001:12:41|T|LMP|Okay.
001:12:42|T|CDR|Yaw is 356.2.
001:12:44|T|LMP|What's your time?
001:12:47|T|CDR|Time is - 1 hour, 12 minutes and 45 seconds.
001:12:52|T|LMP|: Okay, that's nine at 21-minute check, and we got one degree on roll, got two degrees on - 1½ degrees pitch, and about 4 degrees yaw. FDAI Select 1/2, John.
001:13:14|T|CDR|Okay. Well, tell me what that thing on Page 2 - whatchacallit says, Charlie.
001:13:24|T|LMP|Dash 10.
001:13:33|T|LMP|Okay. Spacecr - Service Module RCS control of S-IVB. Launch Vehic - If APS module failed, Launch Vehicle Guidance, CMC; Manual Attitude Roll, Minimum Impulse.
001:13:45|T|CDR|Okay.
001:13:46|T|LMP|CB [circuit breaker] SECS Arm, two [of], close. Auto RCS Select, Pitch and Yaw, Off.
001:13:53|T|CDR|CB SECS Arm, two, closed?
001:13:55|T|LMP|: Yeah.
001:13:56|T|CDR|Yeah? Okay ... get the ... on this here.
001:14:01|T|LMP|Okay, then we got turn off - turn on - put A/C Roll to Main B, and B/D Roll to Main A. Then RCS Command to On.
001:14:10|T|CDR|A/C Roll to Main B, B/D Roll to Main A.
001:14:21|T|CMP|Want to give me your boost cards?
001:14:22|T|CDR|Why do we do that? ...
001:14:23|T|CMP|I'm sorry.
001:14:24|T|LMP|To get - to get commands - to get roll commands. Here - here's one, Ken.
001:14:30|T|CMP|Okay, are you through with that?
001:14:32|T|LMP|Yeah, I'll just leave the landing card up here. Okay?
001:14:34|T|CMP|All righty.
001:14:35|T|CDR|Oh, shoot.
001:14:36|T|LMP|Okay, you want to take it down? I don't care.
001:14:38|T|CMP|[Laughter] I'd like a more positive approach, Charlie. John, you want to give me some of your -
001:14:44|T|LMP|Wait a minute. Let me have the - L - the Boost cards back. It's got the TLI no-go's on it.
001:14:50|T|CMP|Okay. Well, that's - this one?
001:14:54|T|LMP|Yeah.
001:14:55|T|CMP|There you go.
001:14:56|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, then after that, the booster - guy he confir - he commands the burn mode.
001:15:06|T|CMP|These two over there? …
001:15:21|T|LMP|Says if that's successful and we get control, the Launch Vehicle Guidance back to IU; we control pitch and yaw with THC, roll with RHC. Allow S-IVB to drift in pitch, gravity gradient. Control yaw within platform limits. Perform normal procedures except Time Base 6 minus 15 minutes, manoeuvre to TLI attitude and set up ORDEAL. Hold TLI attitude until ignition. Null ullage deviations with service module RCS. After ignition, RCS Command, Off. Auto RCS Select, 16, Main A, Main B. Manual Attitude, three, to Rate Command. After cut-off, go back to CMC. Manual Attitude, three, Accel Command. RCS Command, On.
001:16:15|T|CDR|Okay. Well, that's a good thing. I'm sure glad you told me that, Charlie. That - there's the Moon.
001:16:20|T|LMP|Where?
001:16:21|T|CDR|Out the front window.
001:16:23|T|CMP|Hey, John. Would you put my DAC ... for me, please?
001:16:26|T|CDR|Yeah, ...
001:16:27|T|CMP|Okay.
001:16:33|T|CDR|It's awful stiff velcro.
001:16:34|T|CMP|It goes right over the <a href="acron.html#dsky">DSKY</a>. Doesn't it fit there?
001:16:36|T|CDR|Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! It goes right over the DSKY [laughter].
001:16:41|T|CMP|It - I mean, it probably really does.
001:16:45|T|CDR|... - .
001:16:46|T|CMP|... on top of that little DSKY. It doesn't fit there?
001:16:48|T|CDR|Yeah, it does. And that's ... coming up.
001:16:57|T|LMP|I can't get my head down far enough. Oh, yeah, look at that. That - Ken, you ought to ... up here and look at that -
001:17:01|T|CMP|I don't have the time. I'm getting my - last little chore done here. I got - I think I overdid it.
001:17:09|T|CDR|Laughter)
001:17:14|T|CMP|[Laughter] Things are getting out of hand.
001:17:18|T|CDR|Well, let's take it f/11, at 250 -
001:17:20|T|LMP|Are getting kind of what?
001:17:21|T|CDR|You think in the middle of the day, we should go to f/11, Ken, or f/8 is still good enough?
001:17:26|T|CMP|Well, I'm just thinking. I've got a little bit of ... in that.
001:17:29|T|CDR|Well, I think f/11 for this time of day is probably the best you can do.
001:17:34|T|CMP|Okay, we got all the cards we're gonna need now? For TD&amp;E [Transposition, Docking and Ejection of the LM from the S-IVB] and all that stuff, straight through.
001:17:38|T|LMP|Gosh.
001:17:39|T|CMP|I got the Flight Plan out; I got the G&amp;C Checklist; I got the Surface Checklist available; I got the star charts, I got the TLI cards, got the TD&amp;E card in my pocket. Anything else we'd be likely to need?
001:17:54|T|LMP|Nope.
001:17:57|T|CMP|Here's your antenna card. Why don't you just stick that up? [Laughter]
001:18:00|T|LMP|Okay, thank you ... my copy.
001:18:02|T|CMP|...
001:18:05|T|LMP|Thank you.
001:18:08|T|CMP|I think I'm gonna sit down and think some more about that TD&amp;E.
001:18:14|T|CDR|Okay, there ain't nothing we can do about it if that module ain't holding attitude.
001:18:19|T|CMP|If it won't hold in attitude, we'll go get it out of attitude.
001:18:21|T|CDR|That's right.
001:18:22|T|LMP|Looks like it's in attitude now.
001:18:24|T|CMP|Well, it is. I just don't want that little bugger to blow up back there, and get a leak -
001:18:29|T|CDR|That's exactly what I've been thinking all this time. You know, they ain't never said nothing about that.
001:18:34|T|LMP|Well, they got this -
001:18:35|T|CMP|They said they got that relief valve.
001:18:36|T|LMP|They got the relief valve.
001:18:38|T|CDR|Yeah. God willing, when the relief valve comes through, Charlie.
001:18:44|T|CMP|But he said it was over the relief pressure, didn't - already, didn't he?
001:18:47|T|CDR|Something like that -
001:18:48|T|LMP|He said that it was - as far as they could tell, it was right at the relief pressure. How can -
001:18:52|T|CMP|... you talking about? We don't have double gage [?]. We didn't start -
001:19:02|T|LMP|I'm gonna take this thing - little dealy off here. The official ASPO [Apollo Spacecraft Program Office] circuit breaker putter-inner. Coming off.
001:19:16|T|CMP|Okay, I've got a stowage place for it, but it's kind of hard to get to right now.
001:19:19|T|CDR|Oh, yeah.
001:19:20|T|LMP|You just want me to leave it on, then?
001:19:21|T|CMP|If it's not in your way.
001:19:23|T|LMP|No, it's not. I ... -
001:19:24|T|CMP|Why don't we just leave it there until I get a chance to take it down and play with it, because I have a place for it ... in.
001:19:30|T|LMP|Okay.
001:19:34|T|CDR|It's right on ... should start.
001:19:37|T|CMP|Apparently, it's just the regulator. But the helium supply ... -
001:19:41|T|LMP|Well, they're afraid -
001:19:42|T|CDR|... off.
001:19:43|T|LMP|- I think they're gonna give - afraid they're gonna give out of gas.
001:19:47|T|CMP|Well, that's what I'm afraid of, too.
001:19:50|T|CDR|It won't start up.
001:19:53|T|CMP|... Get it in?
001:20:14|T|CMP|What time?
001:20:15|T|LMP|... 01:20.
001:20:29|T|CDR|A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I said, "The pressure looks good up here." They said, "Well, it ain't your pressure; it's the APS.
001:20:36|T|LMP|Oh.
001:20:56|T|CMP|How's everything up in this old panel look?
001:20:59|T|LMP|Fine, Ken.
001:21:00|T|CDR|This just looks downtown, Charlie and Ken.
001:21:02|T|CMP|Yeah.
001:21:03|T|LMP|Well -
001:21:04|T|CMP|Well.
001:21:05|T|CDR|Well.
001:21:07|T|CMP|Is it ever beautiful.
001:21:08|T|LMP|It is ever beautiful.
001:21:18|T|CMP|Oh, man.
001:21:19|T|LMP|Yeah.
001:21:42|T|CMP|I thought it ... -
001:21:43|T|CDR|You got it wrapped around ...
001:21:44|T|LMP|Yeah.
001:21:45|T|CMP|Hot dang.
001:21:46|T|LMP|Okay. Twist the other one, Ken, because all the ... going around your back.
001:21:49|T|CMP|Oh, I see what's happened. Yeah.The old ... put it on one way, and ...
001:22:10|T|LMP|What makes the helium pressure - would make it go up?
001:22:14|T|CDR|The regulator failed to open.
001:22:21|T|CMP|Did - did you get a picture of all that good stuff, John? I'm sure we got -
001:22:28|T|CDR|That's 10,000 pictures of horizons and sunrises. I got a picture of the Moon out there ... coming up.
001:22:33|T|LMP|It's gone.
001:22:34|T|CMP|Going ... -
001:22:35|T|CDR|- ... coming up.
001:22:36|T|LMP|Supposed to be up.
001:22:48|T|CDR|Okay, here's ... that's gonna get ... as about ...
001:22:54|T|CMP|Two ...
001:22:55|T|LMP|What?
001:22:56|T|CMP|220, ... you think?
001:22:57|T|LMP|210.
001:22:59|T|CDR|All that ... right after insertion ...
001:23:07|T|LMP|You can extend the docking probe if you want to.
001:23:10|T|CDR|We gonna do that over the States?
001:23:12|T|LMP|Well, they can't tell.
001:23:14|T|CMP|Look under -
001:23:15|T|CDR|Want to hear it go "clunk?" Circuit breakers are in.
001:23:24|T|CMP|Okay.
001:23:25|T|CDR|Take that and put it somewheres else.
001:23:26|T|CMP|Okay, shall we? Extend/Release. Cover.
001:23:36|T|LMP|There it goes.
001:23:37|T|CDR|... what it does.
001:23:38|T|CMP|And the cabin pressure didn't go up?
001:23:40|T|CDR|...
001:23:41|T|CMP|Oxygen flow ... go up. That's also very nice.
001:23:44|T|LMP|Did you get the ... through?
001:23:45|T|CMP|No, I just want to make sure it doesn't. Every time I do something mechanical on the spacecraft, I ...
001:23:53|T|LMP|Okay. Did you go to -
001:23:54|T|CDR|Just about -
001:23:55|T|LMP|Did you go to Retract?
001:23:56|T|CMP|Okay. ... two gray, just like they told me. Back to -
001:24:10|T|CDR|... supposed to leave it there.
001:24:12|T|CMP|Looks like we leave it in Retract, all right. Talkback gray at full extension. Did all those things. That's all did [sic]. (Sigh) [starts talking to himself about the emergency procedures in case of APS failure.] Got all that stuff unstowed. And hold us on a hold attitude. That means I got to ..., damp the rate. If we do it, we'll do it with a - I'll make the turnaround in G&amp;N; then we'll go to SCS - Yes, because with the - the proportional control, I can set up a rate that's equivalent to the ... one. Okay.
001:24:59|T|CDR|Lift that ... up ...
001:25:01|T|LMP|Well, yeah. Well [laughter].
001:25:04|T|CDR|Have to do it ...
001:25:07|T|CMP|The thing I don't want to do is that I don't want to be talking about what we're gonna do and - when they're saying, hurry up and get over here before you lose attitude.
001:25:16|T|LMP|Yeah. Did you put the Flight Plans in R-12, Ken?
001:25:18|T|CMP|You should have Volume One in here.
001:25:20|T|LMP|Okay.
001:25:21|T|CDR|...
001:25:22|T|CMP|Okay. Why don't you pull that out? Well, you remember we talked about it?
001:25:26|T|CDR|Yeah, I remember that.
001:25:27|T|CMP|We went over the procedures on how to dock the thing in ... -
001:25:28|T|CDR|Yeah.
001:25:29|T|CMP|- because you get there faster -
001:25:30|T|LMP|Well, I hate to tell you, but I forgot to hook up R-12, and ... -
001:25:32|T|CMP|I'll go get it.
001:25:33|T|CDR|It's just floating. Just reach around there, and it will just float right up.
001:25:35|T|CMP|Okay. Sometime here, before we hit the States or something, I sure would like for us to recap the checklist to make sure we haven't left something out.
001:25:42|T|LMP|I've gone over it three times.
001:25:44|T|CMP|Oh, you have?
001:25:45|T|LMP|Yeah.
001:25:46|T|CMP|Okay.
001:25:47|T|LMP|Based on the - our -
001:25:49|T|CMP|Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I - you know, there's some - some of my things that I didn't do because you did, and I don't have all of my stuff checked off, I'm sure.
001:25:58|T|LMP|Okay, you want me to get the Flight Plan out?
001:26:00|T|CMP|Yeah, I wrote some things in there. I think I got some camera settings ...
001:26:06|T|CDR|01:28, we come up ... States.
001:26:08|T|CMP|01:18?
001:26:10|T|LMP|01:28. Here you go, Ken.
001:26:12|T|CMP|All right. Thank you.
001:26:19|T|CDR|(Singing) Dum-do-da-dum-da-dee-do-dee-do-do.
001:26:31|T|LMP|01:26. Sure is quiet up here.
001:26:42|T|CMP|It sure is. Okay, ... one coming at ...
001:27:05|T|CMP|Okay, at 01:30 - Just couldn't believe that these ..., and I'm already so baffled by these things that I wanted to remember about that I need to do. I was trying so hard to remember times and things; and there just wasn't any way.
001:27:25|T|LMP|Well, I'll tell you, all I was doing was holding on to that ascent ...
001:27:28|T|CMP|Man, when that thing started to shake [laughter] -
001:27:31|T|CDR|Oh, ... at staging?
001:27:33|T|LMP|No.
001:27:34|T|CMP|No. The -
001:27:35|T|LMP|Lift-off.
001:27:36|T|CMP|Just in general.
001:27:37|T|CDR|Oh, I mean, that's for sure.
001:27:40|T|CMP|Well, it's just like everybody said. They said it's like being on a freight train on a rough track. [Laughter] That's really weird. And when the -
001:27:51|T|CDR|The only thing that I didn't recognize was - there was a little ripple of pogo that kind of built up and died out to - to - to about 09:07 in the S-II burn, and then it quit at - and then after - after the engine shut down, I felt a little pogo.
001:28:07|T|CMP|After the engine shut down, you felt pogo?
001:28:08|T|CDR|After center engine shutdown.
001:28:10|T|CMP|Oh, in the S-II?
001:28:11|T|CDR|: Yeah.
001:28:12|T|CMP|Yeah, it quit at 09:05. I remember that number.
001:28:14|T|CDR|Yeah, 09:07.
001:28:15|T|CMP|And it was - Yeah. And it was - the thing that bugged me was that the pogo or the buzz that we got in the S-IV was the same frequency; makes me think maybe that was coming from, not from the booster, but from the understage or something like that. Because it was a - I would have expected to, you know, to get a frequency change, wouldn't you?
001:28:40|T|CDR|... I wouldn't even think about it anymore. Okay, there's the coast of - of Baja.
001:28:48|T|LMP|Yes, sir.
001:28:52|T|CMP|Look at him out there ahead.
001:28:54|T|LMP|Look. Yeah, way ahead.
001:28:58|T|CDR|You know that center window isn't too good for that. Charlie, do you want to see if you get to take a pic - picture, or do you think it's worthwhile?
001:29:06|T|LMP|Well, I don't know.
001:29:09|T|CDR|Huh? I got so much junk in the window, I can't do it.
001:29:13|T|CMP|Like my ...
001:29:14|T|CDR|Yeah. Very good.<a href="70mm/118-18857.jpg"><img src="70mm/118-18857small.jpg" alt="118-18857 small" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 120px; height: 120px;" align="right"></a>
001:29:15|T|LMP|Yeah, give me - give me the camera.
001:29:17|T|CDR|Yeah, well, I got it set up at f/11, infinity -
001:29:21|T|CMP|Okay, how about let's record the - what you take pictures of and things like this and all that ... and how to do it.
001:29:25|T|LMP|Yeah, well, here comes - <a href="70mm/118-18858.jpg"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 120px; height: 120px;" alt="118-18858 small" src="70mm/118-18858small.jpg" align="right"></a>
001:29:27|T|CMP|You took - did you just take one, John?
001:29:29|T|CDR|No, I took two, one of which was the - No, that was the - it was the thunderstorm that really attracted me down there -
001:29:38|T|LMP|Okay, that's Baja down there.<a href="70mm/118-18859.jpg"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 120px; height: 120px;" alt="118-18859 small" src="70mm/118-18859small.jpg" align="right"></a>
001:29:40|T|CDR|Yeah.
001:29:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 1 hour, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 16 at an orbit of 96 nautical miles (177 km) by 94 nautical miles (174 km).

001:29:43|T|CMP|Why don't you read off and tell me what you got there, Charlie?
001:29:45|T|LMP|Okay, frame count number ... -
001:29:47|T|CDR|You got signal strength yet?
001:29:48|T|LMP|Not yet.
001:29:49|T|CMP|You on the right antenna?
001:29:51|T|CDR|... now.
001:29:52|T|LMP|Yeah, well, I don't know.
001:29:54|T|CMP|Well, let's do that the first ...
001:29:55|T|LMP|Well, we have it - orb rate. We ought to be -
001:29:59|T|CMP|We ought to be on the top one, or we ought to be on B or D.
001:30:05|T|LMP|We're on B ...
001:30:10|T|CMP|All right ... we get it. We get a signal right now.
001:30:19|T|LMP|It's about a minute late.
001:30:31|T|CDR|You got our VHFs [Very High Frequency radios] going?
001:30:33|T|LMP|...
001:30:42|T|CDR|No signal strength, huh?
001:30:44|T|LMP|Not a thing.

It will be during this - following this acquisition and during this pass that we will have the Translunar Injection burn. Prior to the burn, the booster of the S-IVB will go into Time Base Six. This will be 9 minutes, 38 seconds prior to the TLI burn and will represent the automatic sequence in the booster leading to the burn itself. We presently show a TLI ignition time of 2 hours, 33 minutes 35 seconds, with the burn duration of 5 minutes, 43 seconds, predicted velocity at cut-off 35,589 feet per second [10,848 m/s] with a Delta-V of 10,389 feet per second [3,166 m/s]. During the burn itself, we will be monitoring data from the instrument unit on the S-IVB. This would be data such as velocity, current altitude and a predicted apogee at time of shutdown.

When we were coming around out about 30 or 40 feet [9 to 12 metres] out, we had a lot of white particles. Looked like it was coming out from around the Lunar Module. Quite a number of them. And, as we got closer, it looked like to me that the primary - most of the particles were coming bet - from between the ascent propellant tank over quad one and this omni antenna. And it looks like they was being jetted out from either some outgassing or something, and we assumed it's Mylar but are not convinced of that.

004:26:16|T|CDR|Man, the thing about it, Gordy, is that the whole Southern United States, Mexico, and that - and - and Florida and Cuba and the Virgin Islands down that way - they're all clear of clouds. It's just fantastic!
004:26:32|C|Ful|Did you take some good pictures?
004:26:36|T|CDR|Got some.
004:26:38|T|CMP|The way we're going, we may have to get a reload before we get to the Moon.
004:26:41|T|CDR|As a matter of fact, you can see as far north as Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.
004:26:48|C|Ful|Sounds great.
004:26:52|T|LMP|And all the way down past the Yucatan and - and into the Central America.
004:32:02|T|CMP|Houston, we've got the cabin back up some now, and our LM/CM Delta-P gauge is reading 0.6, and that's probably due to that Delta[-P] on the cabin. And the O<sub>2</sub> Flow Hight light has gone out, so things are getting back to normal.
004:32:16|C|Ful|Okay.
004:33:32|T|CMP|And, Houston, we've done a LM/CM Delta-P; and at time four hours and 30 minutes, we had a plus 0.6.
004:33:41|C|Ful|Roger.

004:41:17|C|Ful|Okay, we're Go for the battery charge on B, and we'd also like you to dial in the Flight Plan high-gain angles, minus 47 and 98, and go to Reacq[uire].

004:50:51|T|CMP|Houston, got a couple of comments on the EMS for G&amp;C, whenever he has a break.
004:50:59|C|Ful|They're all ears; go ahead.
004:51:03|T|CMP|That must look funny. Okay. We been running null bias tests here for - well, since we got in orbit - each time the checklist calls for it. On the first one, we found that in our hundred-second check, it gained 2.5; then, just before docking, it got 2.6; and I just ran another one, and I have 2.8. And I don't really know what you can do with that, but I just thought I'd go ahead and tell you about that's the magnitude of what we're looking at.
004:51:34|T|CDR|Okay, and our first rough guess as to how the SCS GDC system is performing, it looks like it's well within spec in pitch, yaw, and roll, as far as its drift measurements go.
004:51:50|C|Ful|Okay, Ken and John, we got that.
004:53:15|C|Ful|16, Houston. Whenever you're ready, we're ready to load the PTC REFSMMAT.
004:53:23|T|CMP|Okay, you have P00 and Accept.
004:53:28|C|Ful|Okay.
004:54:19|C|Ful|Ken, sorry about that. We didn't get coordinated here. We don't have an up-link site, so go back to Block until after 5 hours, and we'll try it again then.
004:54:29|T|CMP|All righty. They're back in UpTel to Block. And we're going to be kind of hanging up here for a while anyhow, while we get our suits off. It - it turns out to be a pretty interesting operation with these new B-suits.
004:54:46|C|Ful|Roger.
004:54:50|T|CMP|I'll tell you, Gordy, there were some sights out there that were really something. One of the - one of the things that - most things happened like people had said they would. But there were a couple of things that I had never seen or heard anyone even mention, and maybe they'd been on - been there all along. But one of the things that was really nifty was, while we were in powered flight, both in later stages of the boost and during the TLI burn, there were particles that I could see out the window that were going past us in the plus-X direction, and I kept thinking that that was an optical illusion, and I kept going back and looking at it again, and sure enough! And these were after we were in steady state. It wasn't around any kind of a staging event or anything that I was aware of.
004:55:37|C|Ful|Oh, how about that. I haven't heard of that one before.
004:55:43|T|CMP|Then when we - when we scooted out here and you started your nonpropulsive vent, we could see - First, it just looked like it was a little mist around the outside when you looked at the Sun. And then the Sun hit it at such an angle that you started getting a spectral reflection, and it looked like a rainbow out over the LM. And then after that, you could look out my Number 1 window, and apparently the lighting was just right so that it - it had the appearance of light streaming off to a point source at infinity. There was a little blank spot in it at the - at what looked like the origin. And then all these streaks were coming back towards you, like you were right in the center of a cone. And these things would change colors. They go to a light - light purple, and then they'd have a little sandy color to them. That was another one that I don't remember ever hearing before, and it was - maybe it was just the lighting on it, but it sure was pretty.
004:56:46|C|Ful|Roger. Enjoying the description.
004:56:53|T|CMP|I'll tell you, you can't wait too many years to make this worth it.
004:56:59|C|Ful|Roger.
004:57:03|T|CDR|Gordy, on that boost, that S-IC is a real freight train. I'll tell you, boy. I can't get over that.
004:57:11|C|Ful|Roger.
004:57:14|T|CMP|Could you folks see that thing on the TV up through staging?
004:57:20|C|Ful|I didn't watch it all the way until it went out of sight. I'll have to check here.
004:57:32|C|Ful|Yeah, I guess we saw even [the LES] tower jett.
004:57:38|T|LMP|Good show. John's in the middle of his suit doff.
004:57:43|C|Ful|Okay.

Most of that long description coming from Ken Mattingly, how -
004:57:52|T|CMP|And thanks to good old Stu Roosa's suggestion, we wrote in the Flight Plan to be sure and take a look at the fires out there in Africa as we went over, which is something we probably would have forgotten or never even thought about. And they are just as beautiful as everybody's ever said they could be. They're just all over the place. All these little - little yellowish-red dots down there. And there was some - looked like some low overcast in parts of the area, or maybe it was - from our altitude, maybe it was a high overcast. But it just gave - It looked like looking at the lights of a city through fog, and then there were others that were clear. Just something well worth remembering to look for.
004:58:32|C|Ful|Roger. We'll be sure to remind Ron to look for that one.

004:59:26|T|CMP|Gordy, it looks like this whole operation may take us longer than - than we had guessed. Is there any thermal constraint on getting a 52 attitude and going to those other attitudes? Looks like ...
004:59:41|C|Ful|I'll cheek on that, Ken. We're about -
004:59:42|T|CMP|- but I just wondered if that's something we ought, to keep in mind.
004:59:47|C|Ful|Okays. we're about to a handover here. I'll check on that and come back to you through Hawaii.
004:59:51|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
005:00:46|C|Ful|16, we're - through Hawaii now. And you're scheduled in this attitude through 7 hours or - at least, so no problem thermally, and you're not even due to do the P52 for another half hour, so you're plenty ahead.
005:01:03|T|CMP|Okay, that P52 - We're going to come to a decision point; here pretty soon, whether to - you want us to do that and we'll pick up the suit doffing after that, or we - I'd just as soon go ahead and do the - get all the suits out of the way. And we can do the 52 on schedule, or we can do it after we get the suits off. Does it make any difference to you folks ?
005:01:24|C|Ful|Let me check.
005:01:56|C|Ful|If that's what you'd like to do, why don't you go ahead with the - finish up the suits. No problem slipping the 52 a little bit. And we'd like P00 and Accept for that up-link.

006:44:21|C|Pet|Roger. On page 2-21, we have change from "Shutter 1/15 - 2 frames," to "Shutter 1 - 2 frames.
006:44:34|T|LMP|Okay. That's item 2?
006:44:39|C|Pet|Affirmative; that's item 2.
006:44:43|T|LMP|Okay; that was "Shutter 1" vice "1/15.
006:44:47|C|Pet|Affirmative. And on page 2-22, item 2, change "Shutter 1/15 - 2 frames" to "Shutter 1/2 - 2 frames.
006:45:02|T|LMP|Copy; 1/2.
006:45:04|C|Pet|On page 2-23, item 4, "20 seconds - 2 frames" to "2 seconds - 2 frames.
006:45:16|T|LMP|Okay, copy.
006:45:17|C|Pet|And on page 2-24, under "At T start plus 7 minutes", change "20 seconds - 2 frames" to "1/15 seconds - 2 frames.
006:45:32|T|LMP|Can you say where that is again?
006:45:35|C|Pet|Okay, it's on page 2-24, and it's under the heading that says "At T start plus 7 minutes." &gt;
006:45:41|T|LMP|Okay. What was it? I'm sorry; I got all of that, but didn't get what it was.
006:45:46|C|Pet|Okay. It's change "20 seconds - 2 frames" to "1/15 second - 2 frames.
006:45:55|T|LMP|Okay, copy.
006:45:58|C|Pet|Okay, on page 2-36 - about 1/3 of the way down the page where it says "Configure lens f/8,1/30, 4" - We want to change that to "Configure lens 1/2 stop between f/5.6 and f/8, 1/15, and.
006:46:35|T|LMP|Okay, that's &frac12; stop between f/5.6 and f/8, and the shutter to 1/15?
006:46:42|C|Pet|That's affirmative, Charlie.
006:46:49|C|Pet|And on that same page, about 2/3 of the way down, under the step that says "Electrophoresis Power, On," we want to add a note to hold for instructions from MSFN.
006:47:13|T|LMP|Okay, understand hold for instructions from MSFN. Is that before the Power, On?
006:47:19|C|Pet|Negative. That's immediately after Power, On, and I won't read you that instruction now; we'll wait until we get to that in the Flight Plan.
006:47:25|T|LMP|Okay.
006:50:21|C|Pet|16, Houston.
006:50:27|T|CDR|Go ahead, Pete.
006:50:30|C|Pet|Right, John. This Verb 49 that's at seven hours in the Flight Plan, we want you to hold up on that so we can have a look at the attitude.
006:56:22|C|Pet|16, Houston. We had a temporary very short loss of comm there. Did you do anything on board to return comm?
006:56:31|T|CDR|We haven't touched a thing there, Pete.
006:56:34|C|Pet|Roger. Everything seems okay now. It was very brief, but we lost it for awhile.
006:56:39|T|CDR|Okay. We didn't even hear any squelch or any of that noise - <br>
006:56:44|C|Pet|Roger.
006:56:45|T|CDR|- like you usually get when you lose comm.
006:56:48|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
006:57:42|C|Pet|16, Houston. The attitude in the Flight Plan for the Verb 49 is okay. You can go ahead with it.
|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 3 minutes. The spacecraft will shortly be manoeuvering to the proper attitude to take a series of ultraviolet photographs of Earth using the electric Hasselblad camera which is mounted in the right side window of the Command Module. We expect that as the spacecraft manoeuvers we'll lose lock with the high-gain antenna and communications will probably momentarily drop-out or become quite noisy until we reestablish [a] solid lock-on. The crew by this time should have completed their what would amount to lunch. They're coming up now on the series of ultraviolet photographs of Earth and this is an experiment which gathers ultraviolet photos both of the Earth and later of the Moon for studies of planetary atmospheres.

007:04:13|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. You have Omni Delta.
007:04:16|C|Pet|Roger. Copy Omni Delta.
007:16:29|T|LMP|Houston, 16. Over.
007:16:31|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
007:16:34|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. I think we figured out what all this white particles that's coming off the LM. On the - the side that - of the LM that's between this omni antenna and the APS - the ascent propulsion propellant tank, there's a surface that was gray that is now - for some reason, the thing is all strip - striped looking. It's a surface that's really almost perpendicul - parallel to the plus-X [side] of the LM. And it's all tattered and torn and shredded - looks like shredded wheat, is what it reminds me of. Over.
007:17:25|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
007:17:28|T|LMP|And that's the only surface we have that looks like that, and we continually get particles shredding off from that.
007:17:32|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
007:17:50|C|Pet|Charlie, we're having a little trouble figuring out which surface you're talking about. Can you give us a little better description of what you were talking about there?
007:17:59|T|LMP|Okay. We - On the plus-X side - on Ken's side - the surface right below the docking target that runs parallel to the plus-X of the LM and right into the top of the APS propellant tank.
007:18:17|C|Pet|Okay. Right below the docking target, and it runs right into the top of the APS propellant tank.
007:18:23|T|LMP|That's affirm, and that axis is almost parallel to the plus-X axis.
007:18:29|C|Pet|Roger.
007:18:34|T|LMP|And whatever that surface was, is all shredded, and - as I said, like shredded wheat, and it's continually spitting particles off.
007:18:44|C|Pet|Okay. In other words, you can see it deteriorating now, huh?
007:18:47|T|LMP|That's affirm. It's spitting particles off - about five or ten a second.
007:18:52|C|Pet|Roger.
007:19:18|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We got it, and we're going to take a look at it now.
007:19:25|T|LMP|Okay.
007:19:40|C|Pet|And, 16, we've got a correction to the G&amp;C checklist, page 9-4, whenever you get ready to copy.
007:19:48|T|CDR|Let's catch that after the UV photos.
007:19:51|C|Pet|Roger. Will do.

007:24:31|C|Pet|16, Houston.
007:24:34|T|CDR|Go ahead.
007:24:36|C|Pet|Roger. On panel 382, the Primary Glycol Evap(orator) Inlet Temp valve, we want to adjust it slowly to get that temp to about - to Evap out to about 45 degrees.
007:24:51|T|CDR|You want us ...
007:24:52|C|Pet|And you'll have to go toward them.
007:24:54|T|CDR|You want us to go into manual and set the evaporator - you want to set the temperature - to 45 with the manual while we have the waterboiler going, is that correct?
007:25:12|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
007:25:24|C|Pet|16, you can go ahead and set it. Move it toward Max, and you'll have to go pretty slow with it.
007:25:28|T|CDR|Okay. Can we stand by just a minute?
007:25:31|C|Pet|Affirmative.
007:25:32|T|CDR|Thanks. I got to open up that panel and all that stuff.
007:25:35|C|Pet|Roger.
007:34:41|C|Pet|16, Houston. Can you go Manual on the High Gain?
007:34:45|T|LMP|Roger.
007:34:58|C|Pet|Charlie, it was in Reacq, and it was drifting around.
007:35:05|T|LMP|Okay, it's in Manual now.
007:35:08|C|Pet|Roger. We got it.
007:35:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 38 minutes. We appear to pin down on the diagrams a little more precisely where the thermal skins that Charlie Duke described shredded and spitting off particles are located. Perhaps the best way to describe this would be to ask you to visualize the Lunar Module as if you were looking at the Ascent Stage of the LM facing the porch - the front porch - or the part of the LM that looks like a face, and visualize the docking target, which is on an upper surface slightly behind and to the left of the commander's position. The panels extend downward from this docking target would involve several square feet of surface area downward to the bulbus tank that is underneath thermal skins and that protrude from the right side of the Lunar Module. We have very little data on the Lunar Module at the present time. The only data that we're monitoring is the amount of power being transferred from the Command Module to the Lunar Module. So we have very little information to go on in assessing what the affect might be. As I mentioned previously, the primary purpose of these skins, which are generally consist - although they vary from place to place on the LM - generally consist of layers of coated mylar capton, which are thin plastic-like materials - the sole purpose of which is to maintain the proper temperature conditions for the equipment tanks and so on that are underneath. Among the equipment underneath this section of the Lunar Module, is RCS System A, oxidizer and helium tanks - we understand also there is a water tank in that area. We are investigating or discussing the possibility that a leaking tank might have something to do with shredding of the material - I think that the primary concern at this time is what is causing the material to shred. Among the things that have been discussed are turning the TV on, getting the people on the ground a look, the response that Flight Director Pete Frank got to that suggestion was it probably wouldn't do us a great deal of good, although that one is still an open possibility. And the LM systems engineer is continuing to evaluate the situation and we'll be coming back with additional recommendations. At the present time Apollo 16 is 37,181 nautical miles [68,859 kilometres] from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is down now to 9,826 feet [2,995 metres] per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 7 hours, 38 minutes.

007:41:29|T|CMP|Houston, is that close enough on the evap temp? Looks like I can't hit 45; I can hit 43 or about 46 or 7.
007:41:42|C|Pet|Affirmative, 16. That looks good enough.
007:46:26|C|Pet|16, Houston. On this panel that you were looking at that the particles are coming off of. That's not a hard piece of structure there; that's just a thermal protection covering - a standoff - that's over the top of the RCS A system tanks. And all the RCS [System] A tanks are under there, and what we're concerned about is that one of those tanks may be leaking and affecting that thermal protection blanket on top.
007:47:20|T|CMP|Okay.
007:47:24|C|Pet|Okay, we are considering the possibility of taking a look -
007:47:28|T|CMP|The - Don -
007:47:29|C|Pet|- at the tank systems.
007:47:30|T|CMP|I'm not sure. The picture that we are trying to paint here is like you had painted something and then all the paint started to peel off. It's all stripping off like an old, real - like you painted an old barn and had the paint come off of it. And it's all standing out. You can see it - kind of released from the surface. And I don't know if that fits your picture or not.
007:47:41|C|Pet|Roger. I think that's the way we understand it. Are you still getting those particles coming off pretty fast there now?
007:47:48|T|CMP|They're not coming off as fast as they were awhile back, but maybe that's our Sun angle has changed, making them not quite as obvious.
007:47:55|C|Pet|Roger.
007:47:55|P|PAO|That last description came from Ken Mattingly.

007:51:31|T|CMP|Hey, Don. We're ready to - looks like we ought to be deactivating the primary evaporator. Did you want us to keep it on for awhile or something?
007:51:40|C|Pet|Stand by a minute. Negative, Ken. You can go ahead and shut her down.
007:51:50|T|CMP|All righty.
007:53:47|T|CMP|Okay, Don. We've got the evaporator secured.
007:53:51|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
007:56:24|C|Pet|16, Houston. On that Panel 382, in the manual control, the mixing valve, looks like we are going to have to play with that valve every time we change attitudes. So you might just leave that panel open or closed, for the two of the fasteners, so it will be easy to get into.
007:56:41|T|CMP|Okay. Looks like that's going to be fun around the Moon, doesn't it?
007:56:47|C|Pet|Roger. We are looking at that right now, Ken.

008:01:19|T|LMP|Okay.
008:01:20|T|CMP|Yaw 153. Is it (garble)?
008:01:26|T|LMP|No. We got comm.
008:01:28|T|CMP|Oh! I bet that's what I heard.

008:01:53|T|CMP|The only guys that don't understand space flight are not the flight planners (laughter).
008:01:59|T|CDR|Yeah. The food people.
008:02:01|T|LMP|I'll say.
008:02:02|T|CMP|(Laughter) They is other folks in that operation that don't understand. Well, let's see. I guess you got to cut this thing first.

008:04:12|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
008:04:19|T|CDR|Guess we ought to tape the things. I don't know. Tape up the bags because if we throw them down in there loose, pretty soon we'll have so much stuff down in there we won't know what to do with them. What do you think?
008:04:32|T|CMP|Yeah. We ought to be able to make some kind of a lid to go over it. Tape a lid down or something? Don't you think?
008:04:32|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 5 minutes. Apollo 16 at the present time is maneuvering into the proper attitude for calibrating the optics system that will be used in a series of star sightings. These are taken routinely on the Trans-Earth and Trans-Lunar legs of the flight. The information is fed into the onboard guidance system and is used to update the onboard systems knowledge of so called state vector. The trajectory - of the vehicle is currently on and this data is then compared with the ground figures. And as the spacecraft maneuvers into this attitude we lose lock with the high gain antenna and have [a] momentary drop out in communications. Again, to reiterate the description that we have gotten from the crew what appears to be paint peeling from a portion of the lunar module thermal skins, about 45 minutes ago or [at] about seven hours and 17 minutes, Charlie Duke came on the circuit to describe the location of the lunar module from which a series of white particles that have been described earlier as drifting past the command module appeared to be emanate from. He said it was on the side of the lunar module between the Omni antenna and one of the LM tanks, And had the appearance of skin that was torn or shredded. With particles coming off at a rate of about five to ten per second. The initial reaction here in the Control Center that was one of the mylar or kaptom skins which is stretched over the lunar module surface for maintaining the thermal control proper temperatures within the vehicle had shredded and it was these particles coming off. This is very fragile material physically and since the Lunar Module does not have to withstand aerodynamic forces these surfaces can be very light weight and consequently are quite fragile. The initial concern was from what had shredded the material. Later Ken Mattingly gave us a further description and also we coupled that with information from the LM systems engineer here in the control center. Ken's description was that the material appeared to be paint peeling back from a hard surface. The LM systems engineer verified that the skins at that point on the lunar module are very thin aluminum. He said that they were four mils [0.1 millimetres] thick and are painted which would indicate that the skin itself - the aluminum structure - is not damaged, but the paint which is also on there for thermal purposes is apparently peeling back. At the present time we're continuing to evaluate what affects that might have thermally on the equipment beneath the area. The panels the thermal skins are over RCS System A - one of the two RCS systems tanks. The oxidizer tank, helium tank and also water tank was reported in that area. One of the things that has been discussed and is still under consideration is the possibility of having the crew enter the Lunar Module and power it up enough to give us a look at some of those systems and perhaps allow us to draw some further conclusions as to what might be happening. And as we mentioned previously the only measurements that we have on the Lunar Module at the present time are the power measurements. We're monitoring the amount of power that is being supplied from the Command Module to the Lunar Module.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 5 minutes.

He said that they were four mils [0.1 millimetres] thick and are painted which would indicate that the skin itself - the aluminum structure - is not damaged, but the paint which is also on there for thermal purposes is apparently peeling back. At the present time we're continuing to evaluate what affects that might have thermally on the equipment beneath the area. The panels the thermal skins are over RCS System A - one of the two RCS systems tanks. The oxidizer tank, helium tank and also water tank was reported in that area. One of the things that has been discussed and is still under consideration is the possibility of having the crew enter the Lunar Module and power it up enough to give us a look at some of those systems and perhaps allow us to draw some further conclusions as to what might be happening. And as we mentioned previously the only measurements that we have on the Lunar Module at the present time are the power measurements. We're monitoring the amount of power that is being supplied from the Command Module to the Lunar Module.
008:04:40|T|CDR|Sock me a pill. Is there any left?
008:04:42|T|LMP|Yeah. Here's one right here.
008:04:56|T|LMP|Here you go.
008:04:57|T|CDR|Okay. What do you have to do? Take it loose, or just -
008:05:02|T|LMP|Yeah. I guess. Take the paper off that thing?
008:05:08|T|CMP|No, no. No. Just stick it in the way it is.
008:05:10|T|LMP|Oh, really?
008:05:11|T|CMP|Yeah.
008:05:12|T|LMP|Hmm; I took the paper off.
008:05:13|T|CMP|No, you don't need to. You pull it out - just pull the thing out and stuff it in there and it'll be fine.
008:05:17|T|CDR|It's not edible paper, huh?
008:05:21|T|LMP|I'm thinking about sticking a window shade in over here.
008:05:25|T|CMP|Yeah, you ought to have a little Sun. Well, it's really - ought to end up in here.
008:05:28|T|LMP|What?
008:05:29|T|CMP|Yeah.
008:05:30|T|LMP|The Sun?
008:05:31|T|CMP|Yeah. If you want to put that window shade in, it wouldn't be a - it would be an appropriate thing, I bet. Looks like we're about ready to - Well, we're on Omni B now (garble). maybe the high gain would pick up. Well, it's fluctuating back and forth.
008:06:06|T|CDR|Just leave those bags out until we get a whole mess of them, and then we'll put them all in the cupboard and stuff them in there.
008:06:12|T|LMP|Yeah.
008:06:32|T|CMP|That is going to be a bright bear out there, isn't it?
008:06:34|T|LMP|Yeah.
008:06:35|T|CDR|Yeah (garble). What are we doing?
008:06:38|T|CMP|We're getting ready to go - do a P23. I - You trying to close it or open it?
008:06:42|T|LMP|I was trying to close it.
008:06:43|T|CMP|Okay.
008:06:44|T|LMP|Go ahead.
008:06:45|T|CMP|I'll get it. Boy, that comm is less than optimum.
008:07:25|T|CMP|Okay, now. Looks like I'd better heat up that evaporator, huh?
008:07:31|T|LMP|That's falling off a little bit. See?
008:07:33|T|CMP|Okay. I hate to - (garble) if I put some Velcro on it - a little bit.
008:07:55|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. You want to get down here and P23 your way through this thing?
008:07:59|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I'll be down there in just a second.
008:08:05|T|CDR|Being a big manual guy, huh?
008:08:08|T|CMP|Huh?
008:08:48|C|Pet|16, Houston. Go to High Gain.
008:08:09|T|CDR|Being a big manual person?
008:08:17|T|CMP|Okay, here's two (garble). You're gonna have to screw in this thing, it looks like. It's really bad that we have to play with that thing. Can you - did we stop it in the attitude?
008:08:31|T|LMP|Yeah, we're here.
008:08:32|T|CMP|Okay. Do you think we're gonna - you gonna be able to work on that food business while I'm down here?
008:08:42|T|CDR|Yeah, maybe. I don't know.
008:08:46|T|CMP|I can probably work on this thing by myself, if I - Darned umbilicals.
008:08:53|T|LMP|Hey, Ken, could you put that in the jettison bag?
008:08:55|T|CMP|Yes, sir, (garble)
008:08:56|T|LMP|When you get a chance?

008:08:58|T|LMP|It's all those screws and -
008:09:00|T|CMP|Oh, yeah. I was gonna - you got to wrap up this tape hanging down.

008:09:29|T|CDR|You've got - What? Is yours off over there, too, Charlie?
008:09:33|T|LMP|What's off?
008:09:34|T|CDR|Oh, just - is it just over here underneath the docking ring that it's off?
008:09:38|T|LMP|Yeah. Well, I can see the edge of that panel over here and over there.
008:10:26|C|Pet|16, go High Gain.
008:10:27|T|CDR|Yeah, it looks like some more of that gray stuff come off of it.
008:10:39|C|Pet|16, Houston. Give us a High Gain Antenna.
008:10:48|T|CMP|Okay, John. I'm gonna see what I can do here. Let me see if I can find me a G&amp;C Checklist, P23.
008:11:23|T|CMP|By golly, it's right there. Some things we do pretty well, I guess. This program has figured out how to find stars.
008:11:39|T|CDR|Well, I'll tell you something, you guys. There may be a star out there, but I sure don't see it.
008:11:45|T|CMP|Even in the sextant?
008:11:46|T|CDR|Oh, yeah, it's right in the middle of the sextant.
008:11:47|T|CMP|What'd you get for (garble) -
008:11:48|T|CDR|It's (garble).
008:11:49|T|LMP|(Garble).
008:11:50|T|CDR|Sure ain't in the telescope, Ken.
008:11:51|T|LMP|Oh -
008:11:52|T|CDR|It's right in the sextant -
008:11:53|T|LMP|Oh, yeah; and it's fantastic.
008:11:54|T|CMP|But there's -
008:11:55|T|LMP|Oh, it's just great.
008:11:57|T|CMP|But there's just - that telescope is just useless unless you want to look at the quad or the radar.
008:12:01|T|CDR|Yeah, but what star is it?
008:12:02|T|CMP|It's 40.
008:12:15|T|CDR|Do you see anything leaking out over there, Charlie? Any particles coming off the LM?
008:12:20|T|LMP|No.
008:12:21|T|CDR|Huh?
008:12:22|T|LMP|No.
008:12:23|T|CDR|You see any particles coming off?
008:12:24|T|LMP|There are a few out there.
008:12:27|T|CDR|(Garble).
008:12:29|T|LMP|See, you can't see -
008:12:49|T|CDR|Yeah.
008:12:58|T|CDR|Whatever it is, it's up in the -
008:13:14|T|LMP|It looks like if it had been a leak - in a propellant tank, it would have - it would have - blown up. Blown the whole thing out of there instead of shredded it.
008:13:36|T|CDR|Okay.
008:13:44|T|LMP|Well, whatever it was coming out of there with full force, so it must have had some pressure behind it.
008:13:50|T|CDR|It's still coming out of there?
008:13:56|T|LMP|Do you see little particles?
008:13:58|T|CDR|Yeah.
008:14:02|T|LMP|Does that look like particles to you, vapor - vapor or just a -
008:14:06|T|CDR|Yeah.
008:14:10|T|LMP|Is that what vapor particles look like?
008:14:11|T|CDR|Yeah, I think.
008:14:13|T|LMP|Okay. Here goes.
008:14:18|T|CDR|Houston, 16. Over.
008:14:30|T|CDR|They reading us?
008:14:36|T|CDR|Houston, 16. Over.
008:14:44|T|LMP|We've got a pretty low signal here. Let me go to the High Gain [Antenna]. Okay. You got - put it in ReAcq. There you go.

008:15:00|T|CDR|Houston, this is 16. Over.
008:15:02|C|Pet|Roger, 16. You're loud and clearing up.
008:15:05|T|CDR|Roger. I see something coming off of the Lunar Module now that I - I haven't seen up here looking out the window. I just noticed - it's - it's - it looks like it's coming out of a vent or something. [End of CM transcript until Day 2 at 024 53 25.] And from looking at it through the window, it is beneath this sheet that's sort of shredded off, and it's right between the - that spiral antenna and above the big APS tank. But this is definitely coming out in a stream right now, looks like, and not very many particles, but they're just being propelled away from the Lunar Module at some velocity.
008:16:00|C|Pet|Roger.
008:16:01|T|CMP|Okay. Let's get in there and take a look at it.
008:16:07|C|Pet|Roger. I think you're going to have to get in the LM and take a look at the RCS systems gauges to tell what's going on here. Do you notice any color or anything more descriptive about that stream?
008:16:15|T|CDR|Well, my opinion of the color is that it's a brownish material.
008:16:24|C|Pet|Roger.
008:16:26|T|CDR|And it has long - some of it has long flakes to it, and - but some of it is just little particles.
008:16:37|C|Pet|Roger.
008:16:52|C|Pet|16, we would like to have a look at the LM/CM Delta-P before you start pressurizing it also.
008:17:00|T|CDR|Okay. Do you want us to stop the P23 and go in there right now? Over.
008:17:05|C|Pet|That's affirmative, 16.
008:17:10|T|CDR|Okay.
008:17:15|T|LMP|Do you want us to stay in this attitude, Pete?
008:17:34|T|LMP|And, Pete, you might be thinking about what kind of a - where you want us to enter the checklist.
008:17:40|C|Pet|Roger. I understand. We'll get back to you in a minute, Charlie.
008:17:44|T|LMP|Roger. The Activation Checklist, I guess.
008:17:46|C|Pet|Roger.
008:18:21|T|LMP|We're up to 0.6 on the LM/CM Delta-P, which is what it was, due to our cab[in] pressure difference. I don't think it has leaked any.
008:18:32|C|Pet|Roger. We copied; and, Charlie, we want to start on page 2-1 in the Activation Checklist.
008:18:38|T|CMP|Okay. Pete, how about if I go to a wider dead band?
008:18:53|C|Pet|We want to - first of all, Ken, we want a roll to 91 degrees, and that'll boresight the aft Omni toward the Earth, and also we want the Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
008:19:06|T|CMP|Okays. now. Take it a little slower here. You wanted to do a maneuver to a roll of 90. Is that affirm?
008:19:13|C|Pet|A roll of 91.
008:19:15|T|CMP|Okay. Do you want the other attitudes to be the same as I have now?
008:19:18|C|Pet|That's affirmative. That's affirmative, 16.
008:19:26|T|CMP|Okay, I have 91.00. And we'll use the present pitch and the present yaw, and you get the WasteVent, Closed.
008:19:38|C|Pet|Roger. The Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
008:19:44|T|CMP|We've done that. Okay, we're starting our manoeuvre now.

The additional description that we got a minute or so ago was from John Young. John described the particles coming off as on further evaluation to have the appearence of some sort of a vent. He said that the material appeared to have a brownish color, and appeared to be propelled away from the Lunar Module with some force.

We have asked Ken Mattingly to get out the TV camera and we expect that once Duke and Young are in the Lunar Module cleared out of the way so he can get to the area where it is stowed that he will get it out and we would expect to get a TV picture hopefully showing the area of the Lunar Module where the particles are coming from. And shortly after that we should also get some data from the Lunar Module which is, of course, the thing of greatest interest to the controllers here in Mission Control. Particularly, they are interested in looking at the propellant pressures and temperatures of RCS System A which is in the vicinity of the Lunar Module where we're seeing the materials - particles emanating.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Both, Charlie Duke and John Young will be entering the Lunar Module.

008:47:30|T|CMP|Okay: I'm in Transmit. Got a good monitor this time. I got FM transmitter. I got the S-Band Aux toTV.
008:47:50|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. I think the TV's okay. I think the problem is here. It will take us about another minute, I guess.
008:48:00|T|CMP|Okay, I'll stand by. I'm gonna have to show you the part we're looking at.
008:48:05|C|Pet|Roger.
008:48:29|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. Now we are getting a picture.
008:48:53|T|CMP|Okay. Can you see the docking target, and do you have a grid? I've got a grid on my monitor that you should be able to correlate with. Do you have that available? If you don't, I'll just try to talk you in towards the frame.
008:49:09|C|Pet|Stand by just a minute.
008:49:37|C|Pet|All right, Ken. I guess we don't have a grid right now.
008:49:41|T|CMP|Okay. Right now, the center of my picture is just about on the center of the docking target. Does that look like your picture?
008:49:50|C|Pet|Affirmative.
008:49:54|T|CMP|Okay, I'm gonna move the camera up and there is a flat surface which is now just about on the center of my picture, and it's pointing away from me. This is the one we can see it peeling off of.
008:50:05|C|Pet|Roger.
008:50:07|T|CMP|I'm gonna try to zoom in on it, and I'll see the best monitor picture I can get, and you may have to talk me in on some of the other.
008:50:15|C|Pet|Okay.
008:50:19|T|CDR|Houston. Our Activation Checklist says leave the Cabin Repress breaker closed, but we found it Open. How do you want to play that one?
008:50:27|C|Pet|Stand by me a minute, John. Okay, John. We want that one opened on the way out.
008:50:37|T|CDR|Open on the way out. Roger.
008:50:56|C|Pet|That's real good, Ken. Hold it right there.
008:51:03|T|CMP|I can't hang on (laughter) I'm stuck here; I'll get back with you.
008:51:09|C|Pet|Okay. You had a real good picture there, where you were.
008:51:16|T|CMP|Okay.
008:51:43|C|Pet|Yeah, Ken. We're seeing the stuff coming off of there now.
008:52:15|C|Pet|Ken, while we are looking at it, we are trying to get a hack on whether or not there are any jets firing across that surface that would correlate with those particles coming off.
008:52:24|T|CMP|Yes, sir; there are. My A thruster seems to bang on it quite a bit. And we put the LM Power back to CSM at 08:52; I'd say about 15 seconds ago.
008:52:36|C|Pet|Roger, copy.
008:53:18|T|CMP|Don, are you guys through with this picture, or do you need something else?
008:53:21|C|Pet|Hang on just a minute, Ken.
008:53:55|C|Pet|Ken, we see an occasional particle come off, but we're not seeing a stream. Do you see any streaming like John was talking about earlier?
008:54:04|T|CMP|No, sir. Well, maybe - Well, you know, we're in an entirely different Sun angle now, and it's not clear to me that we don't see different things. Maybe John can take this thing and show you where it was coming from, because I didn't see it.
008:54:19|C|Pet|Roger.
008:54:24|T|CDR|Yeah, I'd be glad to - I'd be only too happy to point it out.
008:54:27|C|Pet|Roger.
008:56:34|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. On our monitor, the place where the stuff was coming out is at A and 1 on the grid. Over.
008:56:41|C|Pet|Understand; it's A-1?
008:56:47|T|CDR|Roger. It's the upper right-hand corner of that square, A-1.
008:56:54|C|Pet|Roger.
008:57:05|T|CMP|Okay. He's going to put it right in the middle of the picture.
008:57:09|C|Pet|Okay. Let's try that.
008:57:11|T|CDR|And, Pete, I'll tell you, that Cabin Pressure Relief valve - I mean the Cabin Repress valve in the LM will really give you apoplexy, boy!
008:57:20|C|Pet|Roger.
008:57:26|T|CDR|Okay. It's right in the middle.
008:57:30|C|Pet|Okay, understand. It's right in the middle of the picture now. Okay. I think we're seeing some of it now.
008:57:41|T|CDR|No. No, you aren't, Pete. What you're seeing is particles that are floating off, drifting particles.
008:57:49|C|Pet|Okay. Can you see the venting now?
008:57:53|T|CDR|No, it stopped. When we manoeuvred it out of the Sun, it stopped peeling off.
008:57:59|C|Pet|Roger.
008:58:05|T|CDR|Okay, Pete. I take that back. You can see a little of it as the particles stream off. When they get out into the Sun, you can see them. And it looked like they had the same trajectory as the other ones, but it's very few right now.
008:58:20|C|Pet|Roger. Kind of going out the top center, slightly right center of the picture?
008:58:28|T|CDR|Yes, that's about right. Yes.
008:58:30|C|Pet|Roger.
008:58:35|T|LMP|Okay, I was off comm over there. How about bringing the old LMP up to speed?
008:58:53|C|Pet|Ken, can we roll to get this area back in the sunlight where we could have a better look at it?
008:59:35|T|CMP|Okay, Pete. We're just about ready to manoeuvre. We are maneuvering.
008:59:39|C|Pet|Okay. I guess you'll want to go back the way you came and go back to that attitude where you had good sunlight on it.
008:59:46|T|CMP|Okay, that's the P23 attitude.
008:59:49|C|Pet|Roger.
008:59:51|T|CDR|Okay, and ever so often, I see a particle come out from that region at some accelerated velocity, like it's leading the spacecraft.
009:00:01|C|Pet|Roger.
009:00:08|T|LMP|I can't see. For my edification, were all the - the (garble) pressures, the helium tanks looking okay on the RCS?
009:00:18|C|Pet|Affirmative. They were, Charlie.
009:00:18|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, the picture we're getting right now is the interior of the Command Module. All three crewmen back in the Command Module, now. And after the look we got at the Lunar Module, on the telemetry data, everything appeared to be normal. We've had a group of very interested engineers and projects management people here in the control center, looking at the television picture. And can see very clearly the panel which had the shredded appearance what Charlie Duke described earlier as appearing like shredded wheat.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, the picture we're getting right now is the interior of the Command Module.

009:01:08|C|Pet|Charlie, we - just as a point of verification here, did you have floodlights when you went into the LM? We didn't show any - any current drain when you went in there.
009:01:17|T|LMP|Yes, sir. Just like the refrigerator, it came right on, with the hatch about a quarter of the way open. And when I went to All, we had all the floodlights.
009:01:28|C|Pet|Roger.
009:01:34|T|LMP|But you can see a lot better over here when you take your shades off.
009:01:38|C|Pet|Roger (laughter).
009:01:50|T|LMP|And, Pete, every time the - one of the Command Module, Service Module, RCS plus-X jets fires towards that - that one over the hatch here, it really blows that stuff off.
009:02:05|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
009:03:24|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. As of this moment, that area is completely free of particles. It wouldn't do you any good to show you any TV of it, because it's not doing anything.
009:03:33|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
009:04:33|C|Pet|Okay, John. I guess that's about all the data we're going to get. We're going to have to think that over for a while, so we'll go ahead and stow the TV camera and get back to the Flight Plan.
009:04:44|T|CDR|Yes, sir. It's certainly an unusual thing; and, furthermore, it's very strange how this upper surface here has flaked off behind the - behind the - docking target, which I guess you - you can't see that on the TV. I couldn't see it on the monitor. Can you see it on the TV?
009:05:11|C|Pet|We get a pretty good look at a portion of it. Looks like a lot of, like Charlie said, shredded wheat.
009:05:21|T|CDR|Yes, it looks like about a half - a half inch or i an inch of grass growing out of the - of the surface there.
009:05:27|C|Pet|Yes, we got a pretty good look at that.
009:05:32|T|CDR|Okay.
009:05:34|C|Pet|I don't think we know what it means yet, but we did get a good look at it.
009:05:38|T|CDR|Roger.
009:05:53|T|CDR|Charlie might say that looks Ba-a-ad.
009:05:59|T|LMP|You're right (laughter).
009:06:18|T|LMP|Did you have a TV picture of the cockpit there?
009:06:23|C|Pet|Affirmative; real briefly there.
009:06:26|T|LMP|That's what I was afraid of (laughter).
009:06:43|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We'd like to get the Waste Stowage Vent valve, Open, again now.
009:07:05|T|LMP|And, Pete, the Lunar Module looks very clean. There was very few particles in it, and that's just about it. Over.
009:07:15|C|Pet|Roger; understand. And, Char - Charlie, we'd like to go into the Flight Plan here at 12:15 and delete closing the Vent - Waste Stowage Vent valve, and move that to 13:15.
009:07:30|T|LMP|Okay; we're moving it to 13:15.

009:07:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 8 minutes. Again, to recap the situation after having the crew get in, power up the Lunar Module and taking a look at the external area where the material on the skin was shredding particles were coming out. We can find nothing obviously wrong and that's obviously reasuring to have all the data on the propellant tanks and the pressures, quantities looking normal. At the present time the thing that we're looking into is the possibility of an unusually large number of jet firings at some point from the Command Module Reaction Control System thrusters that might have perhaps degraded or burned the surface or chemically caused it to peel up the way it appeared to be in the television picture. But, I would say at this point that there is somewhat of a relaxed or at least not overly tense mood in the control center and certainly it was reasuring to see all the data looking good when we did power up the Lunar Module. Apollo 16 at the present time is 44,921 nautical miles [83,193 kilometres] from Earth and the spacecraft velocity 8,851 feet [2,698 metres] per second. And, Charlie Duke reported also that the Lunar Module looked extremely clean when they got inside no particles floating around there have been times in the past where the Lunar Module has had particles on one occasion from some docking tunnel insulation that had gotten in there and also have been occasion where when the LM was depressurized glass covers on some of the instruments had broken.

009:07:34|P|PAO|At the point the crew will pick up their flight plan. They will be about one hour perhaps a little bit more behind where they would have been had this problem not cropped up. This is, however, a relatively slack period in the flight plan. We were expecting to be able to make up the time without a great deal of difficulty. They're scheduled to be taking some navigation sightings through the Command Module optics system. These will be used to update the onboard guidance systems knowledge of its position and trajectory.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> At the point the crew will pick up their flight plan.

009:07:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. As a point of interest, that entire exercise in the Lunar Module took about one hour. We reached the conclusion here in the Control Center that we were going to ask the crew to enter the LM at about 8 hours, 13 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. A couple of minutes after that John Young came up with a further report of what appeared to be particles venting from the LM which we enforced and further confirmed the decision to go into the Lunar Module. The crew Young and Duke to our best estimate were in the LM by eight hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and spent about 16 minutes in the Lunar Module, during which time we got a good long look at all of the critical systems and could find nothing out of the ordinary. And I again repeat Charlie Duke's description the LM looked extremely clean and that does - evaluation would apply equally as well to what we saw on the ground and what the crew saw onboard.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

009:19:31|C|Pet|16, for your information, we're not going to do Midcourse Correction l, and we're looking at about 12 feet per second on Midcourse Correction 2.
009:19:42|T|CMP|That's great.
009:19:42|P|PAO|And Capcom Don Peterson has just advised the crew that Midcourse Correction Number 1 will not be required. That opportunity for the midcourse is scheduled at 11 hours, 39 minutes and by the time we get around to the opportunity in Midcourse Correction Number 2 the amount of velocity change it appears will be required some where on the order of 12 feet per second. By dropping Midcourse Correction 1, of course, that will give the crew a bit of help in making up the time that was lost in going into the Lunar Module and we would expect they would have most of that time made up by the time their ready to begin their rest period.

009:24:01|T|CMP|Don, do you anticipate any significant change in the Verb 49 maneuver angles due to our slip in time?
009:24:13|C|Pet|Negative; none at all, Ken.
009:24:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 58 minutes. We have had virtually no conversations with the crew since they have completed the exercise in checking out the Lunar Module, some 45 minutes or se ago. And it has been relatively quiet here in the Control Center. We've had no further discussions of the problem, or apparent lack of a problem with Lunar Module. The situation to recap began prior to this shift's coming on shortly after the translunar injection where the crew report of particles apparently coming off the Lunar Module. And at the time it was not known where they were coming from or what the nature of them might be. At Ground Elapsed Time of 7 hours, 17 minutes, Charlie Duke came on the circuit and reported that the white particles appeared to be coming from a portion of the Lunar Module below the docking target, and this would be on the right side of the LM as you are facing the Lunar Module looking towards the front porch and what's commonly or frequently described as the face of the Lunar Module ascent stage. He described the surface as having an appearence of paint or coating, peeling and giving the texture of shredded wheat. The immediate reaction here in the Control Center was one of concern for the possible thermal affects that this might have since the skin is on the Lunar Module, primarily to provide thermal protection to the tanks and electrical equipment so on underneath. And it was also a matter of concern as to what might have shredded the skin or coating. We had very little data from the Lunar Module at this time. The only information that we had was the amount of electrical current being provided from the Command Module to the LM. At about eight hours, 13 minutes after evaluating the possibilities and determining that the skin was over an area of the Lunar Module which contained the reaction control system thruster tankage for RCS system A. It was decided here in the Control Center to recommend to the crew that they enter the Lunar Module, power it up and let us take a look on the telemetry at the pertinent tanks, pressures, temperatures, and so on. It was also decided to request that Ken Mattingly unstow the television and give us a look at the exterior of the LM. And shortly after this at eight hours, 15 minutes John Young gave us a further report which perhaps increased the level of concern here in the Control Center a bit. Young reported that the particles did appear to represent venting. He said he could see them coming out with some force in a stream as if they were being propelled away from the LM. At this time we passed up to the crew the request that they get into the Lunar Module and power it up partially to let us take a look the other telemetry at those systems. About 15 minutes later, at about eight hours, 30 minutes, Young and Duke were in the Lunar Module and reported that they had switched over to LM power, and shortly thereafter we got a good solid look at the telemetry data. And we know that everything looked fine - all of the tank pressures were normal, the quantities were normal, and the temperatures were also normal. And we looked at the telemetry long enough to assure the LM systems engineers that we had had no leaks and that there were no leaks in progress, and there was nothing to indicate any problem whatsoever. Charlie Duke on coming out of the Lunar Module reported that everything inside looked very clean, and at about that time we also got the television picture from the Command Module camera which Ken Mattingly was operating and could see here in the Control Center a very clear picture of the few square feet of panels that were involved on the Lunar Module. These are aluminum skins about 4/1000 of an inch [0.1 millimetres] thick, and they are painted. And the description that Charlie Duke gave appeared to be very accurate. The TV picture we saw here in the Control Center indeed looked very much like shredded wheat. The surface had the paint curling up as if it had grass growing on it, or shreds of shredded wheat on the surface scattered around on what should have been a smooth relatively shiny surface. I'm seeing nothing to explain the problem. The last thought that was discussed here in the Control Center was the possibility that some affect from one of the reaction control systems thrusters on the Command Module had caused the surface to degrade - possibly heat or chemical components, or something of that nature, and there appeared to be no problem associated with it. There has been no further discussion since that time, and there appears to be no further concern at the moment over what could have been a problem. The crew is presently involved in a series of star sitings, using the optical equipment, the sextant on the Command Module. Ken Mattingly is performing this exercise, taking sightings on a series of four stars, and then marking, pushing a button which enters the information into the Command Module guidance system.</p>    <p class="pao"><b><a name="009_59_00"></a>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 58 minutes.

010:04:27|C|Pet|Affirmative. Still with you.
010:04:30|T|CMP|Okay. Hey, let me give you a couple of comments here in real time so you can write them down. Yes,one of the things that had been mentioned was this business about the reflections in the sextant when you're doing P23s, and I've got a - gee it's a beautiful picture of the Earth horizon; the optics are just super, and we've got a- got a -what looks like an inverted - sort of like a mirror image -in the opposite side away from the horizon. It's really quite obvious -
010:05:06|C|Pet|That's in the -
010:05:07|T|CMP|And you can just see the bright areas.
010:05:10|C|Pet|Roger. That's in the sextant.
010:05:10|T|CMP|And it's about - yes, it's just in the sextant, and it's about - oh, I don't know how to give you a percentage of the intensity, but it is much less intense than - than the thing in the Earth. That's - that's very bright. And the star is - gee, the match between the Earth horizon as seen through the fixed line of sight and the star line of sight is just perfect. It's really nice. The only thing I can't see as well as I'd like is the crosshairs, and with the illumination turned up to full bright, they just don't stand out when the old Earth is in the field of view. When I get them down against the Earth itself, then I can see the dark: line, but when I get it out in the sky beyond the Earth's horizon, I just don't see it as well as I'd like.
010:06:03|C|Pet|Roger. Copy.
010:06:06|T|CMP|And, as you probably noticed there, we used that little adaptive short P23 erasable program, which is really swift; that thing just fires these things off, and I don't feel like in any way we're having to take short cuts on the pointing accuracy. The only time it takes now is to dress up the substellar point on initial acquisition. That's what we're doing now, and it seems to take quite a while.
010:06:37|C|Pet|Roger.
010:06:37|P|PAO|That was Ken Mattingly.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> That was Ken Mattingly.
010:07:16|T|CMP|Next time we design a spacecraft, Don, we should remember not to put the optics in the kitchen.
010:07:23|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
010:07:23|P|PAO|That was Ken Mattingly giving a subjective evaluation of the optics and of the program used in computing these mid course navigations. Mattingly noted that there was a reflection in the CSM sextant the optical device that he was looking through in lining up a star in this case over the Earth horizon. Once the star is lined up in the proper position Mattingly pushes a button and the computer automatically notes the time and the angle between the star and the Earth horizon. And from this computes and updates its knowledge of the spacecraft position's trajectory. Mattingly noted that the - there did appear to be some somewhat of a reflection in the optics and he said it's primary affect was that it tended to wash out the cross hairs but that this was not particularly a problem. He said it was not as clean as he would like it, but we can verify it from the results that he's getting which we're watching here on the ground, but he is indeed having no problems, the flight activities officer who is watching the entries that are made into the computer said that the data that Mattingly is getting is better than was expected preflight.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> That was Ken Mattingly giving a subjective evaluation of the optics and of the program used in computing these mid course navigations.

010:16:38|T|CDR|That's the first Mark, isn't it? I think he cycled on it.
010:17:03|T|CDR|Yes, he's been taking a little bit longer each one.
010:17:03|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Ken Mattingly is still involved in taking the midcourse sightings through the CSM sextant. On completing that activity the flight plan becomes relatively unencumbered. We don't have very many additional scheduled activities and we expect that the crew will be able to make up the hour that was lost in getting into the Lunar Module and checking - checking out what appeared to be a possible problem resulting from that the - one of the skins on the Lunar Module was peeling and the material flaking off and the possibility that something was underneath - one of the tanks or something connected with the LM thrusters and reaction control system was possibly venting and as we mentioned previously on getting into the Lunar Module checking things out everything appeared to be normal. The - one thing that we did notice when we had the television on the area of the LM which was affected one of the aluminum panels several square feet in area was that when one of the thrusters on the CSM was firing and in particular forward firing service module thruster that the material which had flaked off appeared to be disturbed and this would cause it to float off or to be propolled away from the Lunar Module. Flight Director Pete Frank feels that the most likely affect of the thruster is in disturbing the degraded surface and he feels that it is less likely that the thruster impinging on the surface itself actually caused the problem, although at this point any any hypothesis as to what what caused the degradation of this thermal skin is purely speculative and we've seen nothing in the data to indicate any problem; however, the skin does appear abnormal and we have no explanation for it at this point. The midcourse correction maneuver which was in the flight plan the opportunity for that midcourse correction at 11 hours, 39 minutes will not be required. The spacecraft is very close to the preplanned trajectory the Flight Dynamics Officer reported that a maneuver of only about 8 feet per second would be required. This is so small that it will not be performed at this opportunity, but will be allowed to continue until the second midcourse correction opportunity at which time the amount of change in velocity that would be required would have grown to only about 12 feet per second. By deleting this midcourse correction that reduces the amount of things that the crew has to accomplish before their rest period which is scheduled to begin about four and a half hours from now and makes it appear quite likely that they will back on the normal flight plan by that time. At 100 or rather 10 hours, 27 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

010:59:26|C|Pet|16, Houston.
010:59:29|T|CDR|Go ahead, Don.
010:59:30|C|Pet|Roger; we are going to dilute - delete that maneuver to thermal attitude that's coming up in the Flight Plan at about 9:30 - in the Flight Plan. Also, when you get a chance, we want you to zero Noun 26, because there's a possibility that if you hit a Noun 30 with what you got in Noun 26 now, you'll get a transfer to a wrong place in the program.
010:59:58|T|CDR|Understand. Zero Noun 26.
011:00:02|C|Pet|Roger.
011:00:32|T|CDR|Boy, you guys are reading our minds up there, or down there.
011:00:43|T|CDR|What do you want to do? Just go right into PTC?
011:00:48|C|Pet|Negative; we're going to do the P52 that's at - down around 10:40 in the Flight Plan.
011:00:55|T|CDR|Understand. And then go to PTC, huh?
011:01:03|C|Pet|Negative; we got some UV photos at 12:20 that have to be done at 12:20.
011:01:22|T|CDR|Oh, yeah.
011:13:41|C|Pet|16, you can go ahead and torque them.
011:16:56|C|Pet|16, we got a state vector update, if you'll go to Accept.
011:17:06|T|CMP|Roger; you've got P00 and Accept.
011:17:07|C|Pet|Roger. And, also if you can copy, we've got a change to the G&amp;C Checklist, Page 9-4.
011:17:36|T|CMP|Okay, I'm on Page 9-4, Don.
011:17:39|C|Pet|Roger; under Baker, column Baker, line 4, change from 11522 to 13353, and, on line 5, change 13000 to 00041.
011:18:05|T|CMP|Okay, I'm on Page G/9-4, column Bravo, line 04 is 13353; that replaces 11522. Line 05, 00041 replacing 13000.
011:18:28|C|Pet|That's affirmative, Ken.
011:18:32|T|CMP|All right, sir.
011:19:00|C|Pet|And, 16, you can have the computer.
011:19:08|T|CMP|Okay, we are back to Block.
011:19:13|C|Pet|Roger.
011:19:45|T|CMP|Don, you folks ready for a little fuel cell purge?
011:19:50|C|Pet|I believe we're ready.

011:21:15|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
011:25:19|C|Pet|16, Houston. We're looking at an O2 flow of less than one pound per hour, and we'd like to know if you have closed the waste storage vent valve.
011:25:32|T|CMP|Negative.
011:25:34|C|Pet|Roger; understand negative.
011:29:22|T|CMP|Houston, do you want us to dump the waste water down to about 10?
011:29:29|C|Pet|It's already 60.
011:29:32|T|CMP|Okay, ten percent it'll be.
011:29:34|C|Pet|Roger.
011:40:17|C|Pet|16, let's terminate the charge on Battery Bravo.
011:40:25|T|CDR|Roger.
011:40:32|T|CMP|Okay, we're showing about 29 percent on our waste water, Don. How does that look with what you all have on the ground?
011:40:40|C|Pet|Well, we're looking at about 30.5 percent now.
011:40:45|T|CMP|Okay, so you want us to terminate ours at 10 percent; our gauge reading of 10 percent will be good enough?
011:40:54|C|Pet|That's affirmative, 16.
011:40:57|T|CMP|Okay.
011:43:30|T|CDR|Okay, we've terminated the waste dump.
011:43:34|C|Pet|Roger.
011:47:47|T|CDR|Houston, we vented the batteries and it went to 0.4, looks - maybe 0.2 now.
011:47:54|C|Pet|Roger.
011:48:28|C|Pet|Charlie, did you get a reading on that battery before you vented it?
011:48:37|T|LMP|Roger. 0.9.
011:48:41|C|Pet|Charlie, was that 0.9?
011:48:46|T|LMP|Affirmative.
011:48:47|C|Pet|Roger.
011:48:47|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 11 hours, 59 minutes; and it's continued rather quiet here at Mission Control. We've had relatively few conversations with the crew aboard Apollo 16 in the last 45 or 50 minutes. The activities aboard the spacecraft have been primarily housekeeping sorts of things. Dumping the waste water; these tanks gradually fill up from excess water produced by the fuel cells and at a given level, they are dumped back down to about ten percent of their capacity. The crew has aligned the guidance platform used as a reference for attitude. They'll be changing out the lithium hydroxide canister that - one of the canisters that removes carbon dioxide from the spacecraft atmosphere. They also purged the fuel cells, running oxygen through the fuel cell is at a high flow rate to remove any impurities and they are scheduled to be taking another series of ultraviolet photographs of Earth prior to beginning their rest period. They will also set the spacecraft up in the so called Passive Thermal Control mode where the entire vehicle is rotated about its longitudinal axis at the rate of about three revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature equilibrium.

012:01:14|C|Pet|16, could you give us a reading on LM/CM Delta-P?
012:01:39|T|CMP|Roger. LM/CM Delta-P is 0.2, which is what it was in the altitude chamber, and that apparently zero on our gauge.
012:01:48|C|Pet|Roger; understand.
012:02:04|T|CMP|And the pressure equalization valve is verified closed.
012:02:10|C|Pet|Roger.
012:10:06|C|Pet|16, Houston. On this UV photography, we want to be sure we go Mode, Free. I think last time, we didn't get that.
012:10:20|T|CMP|No, we did get it last time.
012:10:33|T|CMP|Pete, on the last sequence, we did go Free.
012:10:39|C|Pet|Say again.
012:10:44|T|CMP|I said, on that first UV sequence we had, we did go Free.
012:10:48|C|Pet|Roger.
012:17:12|C|Pet|16, go Omni Delta.
012:22:13|C|Pet|16, when you finish the UV photos, we'd like you to go on and start the PTC right away if you concur with it.
012:22:25|T|CDR|Be glad to.
012:22:29|C|Pet|Roger; and, in connection with that, we'll ask you to stow the high gain prior to going into PTC.
012:22:46|T|CDR|Okay. We'll stow it.
012:22:49|C|Pet|Roger.
012:32:04|T|CMP|Hey, Don, you really can get some pretty stable initial conditions.
012:32:09|C|Pet|Good deal.
012:40:45|T|CMP|Say, Houston; Casper.
012:40:48|C|Pet|Go ahead, Casper.
012:40:51|T|CMP|It looks - it looks to me like we've used a - a lot more RCS propellant than I would have guessed. Is it just our onboard readings or is that a fact?
012:41:10|C|Pet|We're seeing apparently some biases in the P - in the RCS sensors up there. Stand by - wait one. We'll get you some readings, Ken.
012:41:23|T|CMP|Okay; thank you.
012:44:59|C|Pet|Omni Alpha, 16.
012:45:08|T|CDR|Omni Alpha.
012:47:54|C|Pet|16, prior to entering PTC, go Manual and Wide on the High Gain and minus 52 and 270.
012:48:10|T|CDR|Okay.
012:48:51|T|CDR|Okay; you got Manual and Wide, minus 52 and 270.
012:48:56|C|Pet|Roger; thank you.
012:53:25|C|Pet|16, Houston. We're going to have to delay going into the PTC until after we close the Waste Stowage Vent valve at 13:50.
012:53:41|T|LMP|Okay. We're supposed to wait 20 minutes for the rates to damp anyhow, huh?
012:53:49|C|Pet|Sounds right.
012:54:40|C|Pet|Ken, on the RCS quantities, I've got some numbers for you here.
012:54:52|T|CMP|Go ahead.
012:54:54|C|Pet|Roger. The - Quad A is reading 1.5 low; all the rest of them are - are reading high. Quad Bravo is 0.6, Charlie is 5.7, and Delta is 5.6. And our Delta on the Flight Plan is a plus 5 total right now.
012:55:42|T|CMP|Okay, is that - is that pounds, or percent, or degrees, or what? Over.
012:55:49|C|Pet|The - the total of 5 pounds is pounds.
012:55:55|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
012:55:56|C|Pet|Roger.
012:56:52|C|Pet|16, Houston. We're starting to see a high temperature in the subsatellite battery in the SIM bay, so what we'd like to do is go ahead and close the Waste Stowage Vent valve now and get into PTC as soon as we can.
012:57:11|T|CMP|Roger. Waste Stowage Vent going Closed now.
012:57:29|T|CMP|Houston, how do the rates look to you for going into PTC now?
012:57:34|C|Pet|Stand by one, and we'll take a look.
012:57:47|C|Pet|The rates look good and you can go ahead into PTC.
012:57:51|T|CMP|Roger.
012:57:51|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 13 hours. Apollo 16 will shortly be going into its Passive Thermal Control mode with the spacecraft rotating at about the rate of three revolutions per hour to maintain proper temperatures and we do have from the flight dynamics officer now a preliminary estimate on the time and location that the Saturn 3rd stage, the S-IVB will impact the Moon. This event is tentatively now expected to occur at 75 hours, 6 minutes, 28 seconds. And the preliminary target point - we expect that this will change somewhat as we get additional tracking on the Saturn stage - is lattitude 1 degree, 12 minutes north; 22 degrees, 38 minutes west. This is about seven and a half degrees off of the planned target point, 30 degrees west was the nominal impact point for of S-IVB as I said, we expect that these coordinates will be updated as we get additional tracking on the vehicle. We're now essentially back on the flight plan and having made up the approximately one hour that was lost in going into the Lunar Module earlier to check the lunar module after it was noted that paint was flecking from one of the thermal control panels - one of the aluminum skins on the lunar module and we essentially now made up that time with the crew back on the regular flight plan.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 13 hours.

013:02:11|C|Pet|16, we're going to let you get in - well into the PTC here. And monitor - the primary loop rad out temps and let it stabilize· and then it may be necessary to go down to Panel 382 and adjust it again to try to keep that temperature at about 45 degrees Fahrenheit.
013:02:30|T|CMP|Okay.
013:02:33|C|Pet|And, Ken, if we have to do that, we'd suggest you mark a place down there so that, during the subsequent PTCs you can just set the thing to that mark.
013:04:30|C|Pet|16, go Omni Bravo and we'll take over switching it for you.
013:04:40|T|CDR|You've got Omni Bravo.
013:04:43|C|Pet|Roger; thank you.
013:10:51|T|LMP|Hey, Don.
013:10:53|C|Pet|Go.
013:10:58|C|Pet|Go ahead, Duke.
013:11:03|T|LMP|You would really love this sight. We're - as we rotate around now, we've got the Earth out the window Number l, and it's about - oh, almost - not quite down to half. And you can see India and the continent, and it's covered with clouds, and no photograph can ever describe the way it looks. It's really super.
013:11:27|C|Pet|It really sounds fantastic. Wish I were there.
013:11:31|T|LMP|Yes, sir. You would love it.
013:11:36|T|CDR|You can see all of Australia, too. It's really something else.
013:11:41|C|Pet|About what size does the Earth look from where you are?
013:11:55|T|CDR|Looks like it's about - it's approximately 4000 miles in radius.
013:12:00|C|Pet|Hey, that's a pretty good estimate.
013:12:04|T|LMP|No, it's - it didn't quite fill the window. Well, I'm not - I'm about - I'm about three - my eyes are about three feet from the window, and it didn't quite fill it.
013:12:15|C|Pet|Roger.
013:12:25|T|LMP|You know, a sight like that goes a long ways to make tomato soup taste good.
013:12:30|C|Pet|Yeah, that's what I've heard.
013:13:00|T|CMP|I hate - Don, I hate to belabor the point, but I would appreciate it if the guys that are working Page 68 on the RCS budgeting and all could take a look and - and see if they could determine if there was any place where we were going over more than what they might have expected for that phase.
013:13:22|C|Pet|Okay; we'll have them take a look.
013:13:44|C|Pet|Okay, Ken; for your info, they said you were slightly ahead following LM extraction and apparently we used a little excess during the P23s.
013:13:56|T|CMP|Okay; that - that stands to reason; that not being able to see the reticle on there is a real nuisance. You can do it, and it's - I guess there is also a certain amount of getting used to the knack of flying that thing around. It's - for some reason, it seems a little bit different to find the attitude than it was in the simulator; but the biggest nuisance was the inability to see the reticle, but if that's where we used our extra, that's fine.
013:14:26|C|Pet|Okay.
013:22:50|C|Pet|And, 16, I've got P37 block data for about four different times for you when you're ready to copy.
013:23:12|T|CDR|Okay; we'll get it in a few minutes.
013:23:14|C|Pet|Right.
013:59:21|C|Pet|16, Houston. We're standing by on this P37 block data PAD anytime you're ready.

014:09:36|C|Har|That is affirmative. Leave it in Auto.
014:09:41|T|CMP|Okay.
014:10:24|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. The block data - P37 block data for the updates book whenever you're ready.
014:10:34|T|CMP|Oh, yeah; wait one.
014:12:23|T|CMP|Okay, Hank; go ahead.
014:12:30|C|Har|Okay, that's four - four blocks. I'll just read them in succession: 025:00, 4907, minus 165, 070:45; 035:00, 7454, minus 165, 070:13; 045:00, 5857, minus 165, 094:31; 055:00, 4879, minus 165, 118:41 and these all assume no Mid-Course 2.

014:14:55|T|CMP|Okay; 11841.
014:15:50|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We want to still keep working on this SPS gaging problem. We'd like to get a readout if we could on your SPS fuel and oxidizer pressures.
014:16:06|T|CDR|Okay, stand by.
014:16:46|T|CDR|Okay, that fuel pressure is reading right now 168. Oxidizer pressure is in the green, and it's reading - 186 or 87.
014:17:07|C|Har|Roger. Understand, 168 and 186.
014:17:14|T|CDR|That's affirm, isn't it? And we were told this morning before launch that that was nominal.
014:17:22|C|Har|Roger.
014:17:24|T|CDR|Because - because of a bias in the gauge. So we're probably gonna need some kind of a - another Delta-P figure to go on our LOI card - I mean our midcourse card.
014:17:40|C|Har|That's affirmative, and it's in work.
014:17:43|T|CDR|Yes, sir.
014:17:48|T|CMP|And I think I show we have just at 15 percent waste water, but we are gonna go ahead and chlorinate unless you think the EECOM's don't want that.
014:18:04|C|Har|Stand by, Ken.
014:18:33|C|Har|16, Houston. We're - we're not sure we understand your question here. If you're asking if it's okay to chlorinate the potable, that's - that's good.
014:18:42|T|CMP|Okay. Just wanted to make sure if you ever need a waterboiler, people don't like to put the chlorine in there, so I just thought I'd check with you before I did it.
014:18:55|C|Har|Okay, I copy now. They say still press ahead, Ken.
014:30:21|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. We'll run the cabin pressure up to 57 as per this presleep checklist.
014:30:29|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
014:30:44|C|Har|16, Houston. When you changed the lithium hydroxide canister, we noted a small drop in the suit compressor Delta-P down here. Did you change any of the configuration in the suit loop at the time you did that?
014:31:07|T|CMP|Well, Henry, sometime back there during the day, I opened up the flow line to my hoses that had been turned off and laid them around to try and get some better ventilation in here. But I don't remember whether that was about the same time or not.
014:31:26|C|Har|Okay. We're not concerned; we're just trying to answer the question. That's probably what it was.

014:52:03|C|Har|Roger. The - your first part of your transmission was blocked out. We had a antenna switch. However, on the PTC, guess he thinks it will go throughout the sleep period, and then we'll reinitialize after you wake up. But he doesn't think it'll go a full 16 hours, but it's good for the sleep period.
014:52:25|T|CMP|Okay. The first thing you said was we'll go without the tone booster. We'll go with normal comm delay.
014:52:36|C|Har|Okay.

014:54:10|C|Har|Negative, Ken, I think we're all in good shape here. Everything looks good at this point. You got anything else for us?

014:54:44|P|PAO|And the communications officer here in Mission Control has reported that the crew has indeed turned off the voice switch onboard the spacecraft - are settling in for a night's sleep. The spacecraft analysis status report, dated at 14 hours Ground Elapsed Time, less than an hour ago. Most of the entries state no change or performance is normal. For example, in propellant usage in the CSM Reaction Control System propellants, they are now 349 pounds [158 kg] over the predicted budget for this time in the flight. Fuel cells are working normally. All the cryogenic tankage are in normal condition. The S-band High Gain Antenna was stowed at 12 hours, 48 minutes prior to the time they set up the rotisserie or Passive Thermal Control barbecue mode in which they spin at about 3 revolutions per hour to stabilize the thermal response of the spacecraft. Although their quantities of hydrogen and oxygen are well within predicted limits, batteries are all up operating normally, with the required amp-hours loaded. About a half hour ago, there was a brief discussion of a change - a slight change or drop noted in the suit compressor Delta-P or differential pressure when they changed the lithium hydroxide canister. These lithium hydroxide canisters scrub the carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere. There was no concern voiced however, by the flight control team and it was merely a matter of curiosity. Apollo 16 now 70,213 nautical miles [130,034 kilometres] out from Earth, velocity 6,744 feet [2,055 metres] per second, crew is signed off for the night and unless some reason arises to talk either back to Mission Control or for the flight control team to contact the crew, we shouldn't hear from them for the next eight hours.

About 20 minutes ago, the Flight Surgeon reported that from his biomedical telemetry none of the crew was asleep at that time and that apparently Mattingly, because of a somewhat higher heart rate, was probably doing some exercising. For those persons who are interested in numbers and statistics, the half-way point in distance for Apollo 16, that is from surface to surface, Earth-Moon, will take place at a ground elapsed time of 25 hours; 20 minutes, when the distance to both bodies, Earth and the Moon, will be 104,676 miles [193,859 kilometres].

The so-called sphere crossing, where the Spacecraft leaves the Earth's influence and enters into the Moon's gravitational influence - this is an arbitrary point in space, actually, where the displays here in the Control Center become Moon referenced - will take place at 59 hours, 13 minutes 26 seconds, and the distance from the Earth will be 178,646 miles [330,852 kilometres]; from the Moon, 33,820 [62,634 kilometres]. Midcourse Correction burn Number 1 was not done, and the present predicted change of velocity for Midcourse 2, should the option be exercised for a maneuver at this time, would be 12.7 feet [3.9 metres] per second, a two second burn with the SPS.

024:15:11|C|Eng|Yes. Go ahead, Ken.
024:15:18|T|CMP|Okay. I'm about to finish up on my coffee here. If it's something I don't need to write down, I'll just listen to what you have to say as you - as you read it off.
024:15:27|C|Eng|Okay. That sounds good. On the systems status, the RCS - everything looks fine. You're 27 pounds [12.2 kg] ahead on your usage. Must have a pretty light hand on the throttle there.
024:15:58|C|Eng|Okay, and on the ECS, the failure mode's probably in the control electronics. The valve was driving at max rate - that's 12 seconds, full open to full close, and they saw that on TM by the flow rate. I don't recomnend making any extensive changes since that doesn't seem to be the problem, and thermal runs are being made here at this time to determine the settings for lunar orbit. They don't anticipate any problems with it.
024:16:31|T|CMP|Okay. I - I kept watching it since we've set it. We haven't touched that thing now for a long time, and maybe I just haven't caught any of the extremes, but it looks like it's been holding nicely between about 45 and 50.
024:16:46|C|Eng|Right. We concur. We - we don't think you're gonna have to touch it until you go to the dark side. Okay, and on the SPS - normally during SPS cooldown during translunar coast, the helium in the SPS oxidizer tanks is absorbed by the oxidizer, causing a decrease in oxidizer tank pressure. Your transducer hasn't indicated this, and there - there may be a problem with that transducer. We've got a procedure change that I'll give to you later in your Flight Plan update, prior to the Midcourse 2, that will allow them to check that transducer.
024:17:45|T|CMP|Okay, Tony. And is there any change in the Midcourse 2 time, or is it going to be like the Flight Plan?
024:17:52|C|Eng|Right now, it looks as per Flight Plan. Okay. And on your DSE tape, Hank had a chance to take a look at it. Sounded - said it sounds fine. Dick will be in a little later and listen also, so everything looks Go for - for the operations Lunar orbit. And everything else looks great. It's kind of nice not to have much of a day here. Sure isn't like the sims.
024:18:36|T|CMP|Yeah, I hope we can quote the last sim (laughter).
024:18:39|C|Eng|Right. I got a little -
024:18:42|T|LMP|- You said it all.
024:18:46|C|Eng|That's right. I went through the news. I don't know whether you guys, over your coffee, would like to read the newspaper, but I've got all the news that's fit to print, and I really don't have much to say. A great piece here is in the world of art. One of Vincent Van Gogh's best was stolen from the San - San Diego Art Gallery as part of a display that was named "Out of Sight." And I've got an input from Dottie here for Charlie.
024:19:23|T|LMP|I'm all ears.

024:28:37|T|LMP|Go ahead.
024:28:39|C|Eng|Okay. On the Flight Plan update, if you can dig out your CSM Updates, we'll make a change to a couple of procedures in there.
024:29:04|T|LMP|Did you want the Flight Plan or the Update Book?
024:29:07|C|Eng|Okay. This will be in the Update Book, this first one.
024:29:33|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
024:29:34|C|Eng|Okay. Go to the section on "Flight Plan Updates." It has the EMP programs.
024:29:45|T|LMP|Okay.
024:29:47|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like you to add a last step to each of the four EMP probe procedures. That would make a fourth step on the "Shortened P23" and a seventh step on "Manual range input," et cetera.
024:30:04|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by, Tony. They must had a hand over. You were cut out. Start over again, please.
024:30:10|C|Eng|Okay, understand. All right. In the "Flight Plan Update" section, on the four EMP programs, we'd like you to add a fourth - correction, a final termination procedure to each of the four programs. So on the "Shortened P23," we'd have a Step K, which reads "Verb 25 Noun 26 Enter," and then the "Four registers, Enter all balls" - correction, "Three registers, Enter all balls.
024:30:53|T|LMP|Okay, copy. Four step for P23 is "Verb 25 Noun 26, Enter all balls in all registers.
024:31:01|C|Eng|Okay. And on the next program, the "Manual range input," Step 7 would be the same thing.
024:31:30|T|LMP|Copy. "Manual range input," Step 7 to "Verb 25 Noun 26, Enter all balls.
024:31:36|C|Eng|Okay. And on the "Optics angle to body angles," we'll add a Step 7, and it would be the same as before.
024:32:07|T|LMP|Okay. Copy all balls.
024:32:11|C|Eng|Okay. And on the "Jet monitor" program, it'll be a Step 6, the same thing.
024:32:34|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
024:32:36|C|Eng|Okay. The purpose for these were - was to protect the E-memory from other programs.
024:32:44|T|LMP|Okay -
024:32:46|C|Eng|- Okay. The next change is to your "SPS burn rules." So if you can get that card.
024:33:02|T|LMP|Go ahead.
024:33:04|C|Eng|Okay. On the fuel to oxidizer pressure, it should read - or it does read "Greater than 115." Will you change it to read "124 for oxidizer, 110 for fuel.
024:33:34|T|LMP|Okay. "Pressure greater than 115" is changed to "124, oxidizer; 110, fuel.
024:33:39|C|Eng|That's correct. And in the "Fuel to oxidizer Delta-P," it reads "Less than 20 psi." We'd like to change that to "35 psi oxidizer greater than fuel, or 5 psi oxidizer less than fuel.
024:34:09|T|LMP|Okay; copy "35 oxidizer greater than fuel; 5 oxidizer less than fuel.
024:34:14|C|Eng|Okay. And the final part of that is in the "Tight constraints" there in the box. It says "Greater than 160, and greater than 80." We'd like to change that to "Greater than 168 oxidizer, and greater than 153 fuel.
024:34:44|T|LMP|Okay. "Greater than 168 oxidizer; 153, fuel.
024:34:52|C|Eng|And I guess on that "Tight constraints" also, it's the - the chamber pressure says "Greater than 80" for the "Tight constraints.
024:35:07|T|LMP|Okay.
024:35:08|C|Eng|Okay. And that's the end of that procedure. A note here that this assumes a - a good oxidizer transducer, and there may be a - a problem that it's hung up. And we'll have a - a little later change in the Midcourse 2 burn procedure. And from this, we'll be able to tell what - what - where the problem is. I'll get that up to you as soon as they've sorted it out here. Okay, and there are two notes here. For Ken, a reminder to watch the UV film consumption magazine Oscar Oscar. He's right on the budget now, and there's no pad.
024:35:54|T|CMP|Roger. And there's no way to cut a film out.
024:35:57|C|Eng|I understand.
024:36:00|T|CMP|Now, we're - we're aware of it's being tight, Tony. If you see us slip behind - I - I guess I don't know what to do about it. You'll have to come up with a recommendation of what - what other photo to delete.
024:36:11|C|Eng|Okay. Well, we just thought we'd let you know that you had a two-frame pad, and we've already used it.
024:36:18|T|CMP|You mean we've taken two frames we weren't supposed to?
024:36:21|C|Eng|I don't understand the note here. That was the note I got. Maybe it was used up before - before they loaded it or something. I'll find out.
024:36:32|T|CMP|As far as I know, Tony - Yeah, yeah, I just want to make sure that there's no misunderstanding on our part about what it is we're supposed to do, because we took only those frames that were selected, because we are aware of the tight budget.
024:36:46|C|Eng|Okay; understand.
024:36:48|T|CMP|And we might be off a little bit on the numbers we gave you, because, you know, that counter's kind of gross, and it's easy to get off by a - by a number or so, particularly when you start at the low end.
024:36:58|C|Eng|All right; understand. I'm just off that more than a number. Okay, and a last note. We'd like you to take a look when you get a chance at that - the LM thermal surface, and see if you notice any changes or can give us any more words on it. We really don't anticipate a problem there. It turns out in looking back, there was a history of one batch of bad paint, and they sort of think it's just the paint blistering up. And it doesn't seem to be on a -
024:37:28|T|LMP|All right -
024:37:29|C|Eng|- on the surface that'll give us a real bad problem.
024:37:37|T|LMP|Okay. We're ready to bring up the high gain if you've got some angles for us.
024:37:41|C|Eng|Okay. I'll get them.

I think it's gone somewhere, but there're a lot of these little square - rectangular strips about - up to two inches long; I see one that must be three inches long, and they're just sort of - look like they're glued - somebody glued a bunch of strips of grass onto that thermal shield, but most of them have gone.

025:24:25|T|CMP|Okay; how about telling us where we're going here, because -
025:24:28|C|Eng|Okay -
025:24:29|T|CMP|- I've got to turn this thing on, and I'd like to have it in my mind what it is we're going to do.
025:24:34|C|Eng|Roger. It's no big deal. The note here was, at that point, you're supposed to observe the current meters, and if there's no indication of a current flow in any tube, you tap the box gently along the - the axis, or parallel with the face, and then you allow the whole de - the whole unit to lie motionless for additional three to five minutes before proceeding. They're afraid there may be a bubble in one of the tubes, and you don't get a current.
025:25:06|T|CMP|Okay. Well, actually, there's a bubble in each tube.
025:25:10|C|Eng|Say that again.
025:25:12|T|CMP|Actually, there's a bubble in each tube. And it's each tube has a bubble. They are in exactly the same place. They're lined up in a row, and they are directly over meter Number 3. And the bubbles are about - oh, one-eighth of an inch in diameter.
025:25:41|C|Eng|Okay, the PI says that's okay, and we should go ahead and proceed.
025:25:47|T|CMP|Okay. Now, the question that you had for me was that if - if any of the meters do not go into the green, we turn the power on. Did you want me to tap the box, and then do what?
025:26:02|C|Eng|Okay. The instructions were to tap the box gently, allow the unit to remain motionless for an additional three to five minutes, and then proceed.
025:26:13|T|CMP|Okay; and this time, if we don't get the meters into the green, we proceed anyhow; is that correct?
025:26:18|C|Eng|According to the instructions, that's correct.

025:27:44|T|CMP|Okay, Tony. It turns out that meter Number 1 is just barely into the red; meter Number 2 didn't come up quite into the red; meter Number 3 is about a needle width below the red.
025:28:06|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like you to go on with the experiment.
025:28:14|T|CMP|Okay, I've jiggled it a little bit and I'm gonna let it settle here for a second, and then we'll start. We'll give you a mark when we start.
025:28:23|C|Eng|Roger, we concur.
025:30:16|T|CMP|Okay, Houston; we have started the experiment. Kind as soon as we got it rotating - got it running, and I turned according to the decal on the box, which is counterclockwise, half rotation; and, soon as I did, the orange film disappeared and - I see white particles coming through - coming through as a stream. It looks much like a - a - it looks like latex.
025:31:01|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. Any difference in rates between the different tubes?
025:31:06|T|CMP|Yeah. The first thing that happened, as soon as I opened it, I got a big blob of this stuff inside of the - it looks like the inside of the window here between where it shows - the decal on the outside says "Sample 1 and 2." it's got a big - couple of big blobs in there - the Number 1 sample is approaching it. The Number 3 sample is about halfway between ring 2 and 3. Also have current meter Number 1 is in the green, current meter Number 2 is in the green, and Number 3 is still about a needle width below the red line and didn't move at all. The bubbles are moving at about the same rate as the white material, and the first bubble in tube Number 2 has just reached the yellow band, and as I understand this, I'm going to have to wait until the white material reaches that yellow band.
025:32:28|C|Eng|That's affirmative. The white material in the fastest tube.
025:32:33|T|CMP|Okay.
025:32:36|C|Eng|And we had some bad comm right there in the middle when you were describing the rates and the difference in the three tubes of the white material. If you could say a little bit of that again, it might help.
025:32:47|T|CMP|Okay. It's moving much more rapidly than I had anticipated it would, Tony. Right now, the Number 2 sample is leading by about a nose. It's just crossed the one - two - three - four - fifth ring inscribed on that center tube. The Number 3 sample has just crossed the fourth one; the Number 1 sample has just crossed the fifth one now; and Number 2 is about halfway between five and six. Number 3 sample is maintaining a very cohesive shape and looks like a little cylinder with a pointed nose on it, and it's maintaining its white consistency. And it's going in - I - guess that the length of the - group of particles in there that's maintaining a solid appearance is about the width of one of these lines. Then, it tails out to a very diffuse gaseous - just a swirl material behind it that goes all the way back to the Lexam. The faster samples are diffusing much more rapidly, and they have a little nose on them, which is very thin and leads ahead of the larger mass of material. And they form sort of a cone shape. and they are about two and a half to three ring lengths in length, and - I'm talking about the distance between - sets of rings. And they both appear to be diffusing about the same amount. The Number 2 sample is really starting to break up now and starting to twist the - looks like it's taking on a corkscrew appearance as it approaches the yellow line. And it's approaching the yellow line, and now Nunber 1 is approaching one ... so I'm gonna hit the Reversal Switch.
025:34:38|C|Eng|Okay. You say there is no difference in diffusion between 1 and 2?
025:34:48|T|CMP|Well, there wasn't when we started, now - well, now that we've hit the Reversal Switch (laughter), I guess all bets are off. The - (laughter) they've just really broken up in Number 2 and in - Number 1 is holding together a little better. They really looked very, very similar; except that just as it crossed the last ring before the yellow ring, Number 2 started to get an elongate nose on the point, and it was starting to twist - I say it was looking like a corkscrew. And then about the same time, when - just about the time I hit the Reversal Switch, the sample in Number 1 did the same thing. The sample in Number 3 is doing entirely a different operation. It retained sort of a bullet shape all the way down as far as it went, and now - that we've reversed it, the pointed end, which was on the right side, the direction of motions has now become a flat blunt end, and it's picking up - kind of an arrow-shaped head on the left side as it goes back towards the container. But it's still retaining its cohesiveness. The sample Number 2 just really got all diffused and spread around. And Number 1 is holding together a little bit better. It's starting to take shape that looks very much like Number 3; in fact, the trailing edge - that's the one on the right side now, or sample Number 1 - has just about caught up and looks very much like sample Number 3, except that you can tell that some of the material in sample 1 has been diffused.
025:36:31|C|Eng|Outstanding.
025:36:32|T|CMP|And we're about to approach the original end. Do you want me to reverse it again, or what do you suggest at this point?
025:36:48|C|Eng|Yeah, Ken. We'd like you to reverse it again.
025:36:51|T|CMP|Okay, and I'll do that when the first large portion of the sample reaches the Lexan manifold; is that okay? That's - some of the diffused material will already coincide.
025:37:05|C|Eng|Okay, that sounds good.

025:40:16|C|Eng|Okay.
025:40:17|T|CMP|It's reversed at this time. Mark it.
025:40:19|C|Eng|Okay.
025:40:23|T|CMP|Number 2 is completely - looks like a - an emulsion Number 1 still has a central core that's holding together, and Number 3 is doing a good job of staying together. It's diffused very little.
025:40:41|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
025:40:45|T|CMP|Okay, and at the end of this - it looks to me like it's so diffused that at the end of this run when we get it back, I'll just go ahead and secure it.
025:42:37|C|Eng|Yeah, Ken, I think they're gonna have fun analyzing that one.
025:42:42|T|CMP|I think they've got their work cut out for them. Are there any questions that you might want to get resolved that maybe I - were obvious to me but weren't obvious to you (laughter) before we put it all away? We're going to be closing down here in a couple of minutes.
025:43:00|C|Eng|Okay. The PI is back there, and hopefully he's working on some questions.
025:44:25|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
025:44:29|T|CMP|Go ahead.
025:44:31|C|Eng|Okay. One, you said you - you tapped the box there at the beginning to try to get rid of the bubbles. How long did you wait before you started? I know you gave a mark, but we'd like to verify that.
025:44:45|T|CMP|Between the time we tapped the bubbles and the time we started the experiment?
025:44:49|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
025:44:51|T|CMP|Is that the time frame you - ? Okay. That time frame was - I would guess it was about a minute, Tony. Because when I tapped it, I just couldn't get them to move. I had already - I had already tapped that thing once before, for the bubbles, and - because when - as soon as we unpacked it, we saw the bubbles out there, and I banged it a little bit to try and see if I could get them to move and didn't have any luck at all. So we didn't wait any three or five minutes, it - it was about two minutes, I guess.
025:45:19|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that; two minutes. And on the Tube 1, did you notice any separation of the two sizes?
025:45:29|T|CMP|Not unless that's what this diffuse and central feature turns out to be. But the dark - oh, let me rephrase that, the higher concentration of material that makes it look more solid - if that's a large particle and the diffuse material is the finer particles, then I would say that perhaps there was a separation of small particles from larger ones in tube Number 2 just about the time I reversed it, just starting to show up, and Number 1 perhaps the same. And Number 3, I would say, if that's the proper interpretation, that there was no appreciable separation of any kind. And I'm not sure that Number 1 ever exhibited the - some of the symptoms that Number 2 did. I can't tell you right now which of these tubes splurted these blobs of particles under the window unit.
025:46:30|C|Eng|All right, we copy that. We - I sort of expected from the information we got here that [Number ] 1 would be the one that split up in the two sizes, but I guess we'll have to look at that later.
025:46:43|T|CMP|Okay. Again, I'm not sure what this little burst of material that got out on the window might be. Maybe we lost some of the stuff from one of them.
025:46:53|C|Eng|Okay. That's all the questions I had here. At least the bugs didn't eat the particles.

026:35:24|T|CMP|Negative. We just now took the shade down on my side. That's the first view I've had all morning.
026:35:31|C|Eng|Very good.

027:29:13|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
027:29:15|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I'm back up again. Do you want to talk at - to us about those SPS burn rules?
027:29:23|C|Eng|Oh -
027:29:24|T|LMP|Stand by one. Ken wants to - Stand by.
027:29:26|C|Eng|Okay.
027:29:52|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. Go ahead.
027:29:55|C|Eng|Okay, this isn't the burn rules. It's a discussion of procedures for Midcourse-2 only. And a change could be noted in your cue card - SPS cue card - or the G&amp;C Checklist G/5-2, but you might want to hear the whole thing before you write it down. Okay, at burn minus 6 minutes, the line that reads "SPS Helium Valve, two, to Auto" should be changed to "SPS Helium Valves, two, to Manual for 10 seconds." And "After 10 seconds, SPS Helium Valves, two, to Auto." And then they'd remain in Auto for the burn. And we have a couple of notes to that. First -
027:30:53|T|CMP|You're talking about going to On when you say "Manual." And you don't want us to stay there ten seconds if it exceeds 200, do you?
027:31:05|C|Eng|That's right. If it exceeds 210, we want you to turn them off. And we'll do the burn with them off - because if it went to Auto during the burn, we'd go right back into the problem.
027:31:24|T|CMP|Okay.
027:31:26|C|Eng|Okay. That was one of the notes, and you just anticipated it there. The other note is, you may, if - if we've diagnosed the transducer problem correctly, you'll probably get an SPS Pressure light. That will go on at 201 pounds.
027:31:57|T|LMP|Okay.
027:31:59|C|Eng|Right now, they are anticipating that, by the time of the burn, that transducer will be biased about 15 pounds high.
027:32:10|T|LMP|Okay; that's the oxidizer side?
027:32:15|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
027:32:18|T|LMP|Okay. What is - what do you think is wrong with that transducer?
027:32:23|C|Eng|Right now, the note is that the comparison chamber, which should be at about atmospheric pressure, has leaked. And the leak is just making up for the normal absorption of helium, so the gauge is reading about constant. Eventually, that comparison chamber will leak down to zero, and then you'll be comparing - instead of comparing to 14.7, you'll be comparing to zero, and it will read 15 pounds high.
027:33:01|C|Eng|We're reading about 11 pounds high now.
027:33:07|T|LMP|Okay; our gauge has been constant since lift-off.
027:33:11|C|Eng|Right. We can read the pressure farther on down the line; and, in the fuel side, the tank pressure and the pressure down the line are tracking right along, and they should be on the oxidizer side. But on the oxidizer side, the tank's staying constant and the one down the line is dropping down as it should. So either the one in the tank is just locked up or the leak out of the comparison chamber is just making up the difference.

027:36:00|C|Eng|Just so there is no misunderstanding here, I'd like to verify this up - this - procedure. We're going to Manual for 10 seconds at six minutes before the burn, and then, nominally, we'll go back to Auto even if you get a - a caution. The only point where we'd go to Off would be if it went above 210.
027:36:29|T|LMP|Okay, copy. At six minutes, Helium Valves go to Manual for 10 seconds, then to Auto. If pressure goes to greater than 210, go to Off.
027:36:38|C|Eng|That's affirmative.

027:38:11|T|LMP|Houston, 16. Do you guys feel like that your transducers are good on the ground?
027:38:26|T|LMP|What I mean to say is, do you feel like that your telemetry's good on the SPS tank pressure?
027:38:36|C|Eng|Stand by one, Charlie.
027:40:29|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston.
027:40:33|T|LMP|Go ahead.
027:40:34|C|Eng|Okay, the telemetry here - the telemetry is good. And we can read from the transducer that you're reading your oxidizer tank pressure; we can also read from the inlet pressure transducer, which you can't read on board. The inlet pressure transducer indicates that - nominal decay and pressure due to helium absorption by the oxidizer. And this looks just like all the other flights. The other one is the one that you are reading, and it looks like it's locked up. The reason for the procedure that we've sent up is to make sure that we know the pressures in the lines before this burn, which will give us a baseline to plan the management during the LOI.
027:41:20|T|LMP|Well, okay. That's what had us a - talking in here about how we're going to monitor the LOI.

028:25:56|T|LMP|Okay, Tony; go ahead.
028:25:59|C|Eng|Okay. Last night during the TV show, the lighting wasn't ideal. Maybe you have observed something that we couldn't see in the tapes here. Okay, that panel behind the docking target - was it completely covered with the shredded material? There's an access panel right in the middle of that - of the overall panel there - and we're curious to know if it was just in the access panel, or the whole panel.
028:26:29|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, it was on the whole panel.
028:26:33|C|Eng|Okay, how about any other panels around? It looked like on TV there might be some on that panel just to the right. And, if so, do you have any words on any other panels?
028:26:46|T|LMP|Okay, it's on that whole section there, Tony. There's two triangular panels, one on each side of this rectangular pattern which is right below the docking target. That whole section that is parallel of the Plus-X [axis], below the docking target, the two triangular panels and the rectangular panel all are shredded.
028:27:07|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
028:27:11|T|LMP|...
028:27:12|C|Eng|Say again?
028:27:22|C|Eng|Was there any gold Mylar Kapton visible on the panel behind the docking target?
028:27:29|T|LMP|Negative. It's - it's - apparently just a black surface now, most of the white-looking paint, or whatever it is, is all - most all gone now. There's just a - oh, I'd say maybe a ten percent of the surface is now covered with this shredded white stuff.
028:27:47|C|Eng|The origin of that question was there was some question whether the panel may not have come off entirely and, underneath that, is some of the Mylar stuff.
028:27:57|T|LMP|Well, the panel is still on, in fact, you - you can't even see the Mylar - the - the - below it is a black surface that looks much like the top of the ascent prop - propellant tank.
028:28:10|C|Eng|Okay, and I guess you mentioned last night there was some streaming of the paint as it was coming off. Was there a preferred direction - or what was it?
028:28:20|T|LMP|Yes, radially - well, from us, it was radial to the X-axis. Almost right out over the ascent module - out the Y-axis.
028:28:38|C|Eng|Was it independent of your jet firings?
028:28:44|T|LMP|When Ken fired the jets, it really blew it off then.
028:28:48|C|Eng|Uh-huh. In the same direction?
028:28:52|T|LMP|No, it made it go the other way down towards - the - the legs of the LM.
028:28:57|C|Eng|Okay, and, without the RCS then, it was almost at right angles to the panel and, otherwise, it was going down towards the legs?
028:29:06|T|LMP|Yes, and it looks like - like John said, right now, Tony, as we come around into the Sun, there's some particles coming out - off now more towards Quad 2. And it looks like it's on the underside of this panel as we cannot - we cannot see it, and - but it's between Quad 3 - 2 and the APS propellant module - correction - the APS propellant tank.
028:29:40|C|Eng|Okay, we're looking at the drawing here and see where you mean.
028:29:46|T|LMP|Say again?
028:29:47|C|Eng|Roger; we copy that, Charlie. What we're searching for on this direction of flow is if you think there's any - anything in the area that might cause it to stream out like some - a leaky tank or anything of that sort, or whether it just seems to be almost random.
028:30:03|T|LMP|Say again Tony, you cut out after - all after 'What we're searching for.'
028:30:08|C|Eng|Okay, what we're searching for here is just - We don't think there is any leak over there or anything of that sort. but, if there is a preferred direction of flow, we're looking for any indication of what it might be so we'll know where - where the flow is coming from.
028:30:23|T|LMP|Tony, please, you're - for some reason, you weren't up-linking, and we've had all after 'What - what we're searching for.'
028:30:38|C|Eng|Okay; stand by a second, Charlie. I'll be back with you in a minute.
028:31:23|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie; Houston. How do you copy now?
028:31:30|T|LMP|You're five by.
028:31:32|C|Eng|Okay, we were just searching around here a little bit - Far-out possibility might be that we had a small leak in there or something and it was causing the peeled paint to flow off in a particular direction; and we were just wondering if you had any indication that that might be the case, or whether it's just flying off at right angles?
028:31:54|T|LMP|Well, when we first saw it, that was our opinion also, but now that most of it's gone - is - it - it's sort of just coming off in different directions. Over.
028:32:13|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
028:32:17|T|LMP|And, Tony, the stuff that - is really not white; it's more of - now it's more of a gold-looking color or sandy color now.
028:32:26|C|Eng|Okay. That's the shredded stuff you're talking about?
028:32:32|T|LMP|That affirmative.
028:32:35|C|Eng|All right, the thermal people aren't - aren't upset about this at all. They don't think it will give us any constraint. Evidently, that surface was only on there for the very high-Sun case.
028:32:49|T|LMP|Okay. Well, the panel is intact underneath that paint job, whatever it was. The panel apparently is intact.
028:32:58|C|Eng|Okay.
028:33:14|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie, I guess that's the whole set of questions here. Everybody is very happy with - with what we're hearing.
028:34:15|T|LMP|Tony, that panel that shredded - the ones we were telling you about are - have some more pronounced wrinkle ridges in them than any of the other panels.
028:34:29|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that, Charlie. We'll find out what that means.

030:36:18|T|CDR|Yeah ... -
030:36:19|T|CMP|I'll shut it off.
030:36:20|T|CDR|All right.
030:36:21|T|CMP|... this way. Turn her off at three seconds, or if you holler.
030:36:28|T|CDR|Okay.
030:36:29|T|CMP|Okay. Did the pressure stop going up?
030:36:31|T|LMP|Yeah. It stopped at about 209.
030:36:32|T|CMP|Okay. But - but it stopped on its own. It wasn't because you let go.
030:36:35|T|LMP|Yeah.
030:36:36|T|CMP|Okay. That was all I wanted. All righty.
030:36:39|T|LMP|Fuel side went up to about 175.
030:36:42|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, ... I what there was about that Delta-P? We haven't made such an issue of the Delta-P before.
030:36:56|T|LMP|See that? We said fuel and Ox greater than the Delta-P - greater than 35, Ox greater than fuel. That's what we got right now. Man, I thought I burned them all.
030:37:07|T|CMP|Okay. Coming up on - coming up on a minute. Still have no thrust light on. I have no translation control power on because we don't have any - don't have any ullage.
030:37:30|T|CDR|Yep.
030:37:36|T|LMP|Well, if you want to trim, you got plenty.
030:37:37|T|CDR|Point 5 -
030:37:38|T|CMP|Yeah. I'll catch it afterwards.
030:37:40|T|CDR|- well, ... worry about the trim.

030:42:08|C|Pet|Understand, 170 and 200.
030:43:21|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, our LM/CM Delta-P is 0.8. You want to go ahead and do the Tunnel Vent to Vent until greater than 2.7, right?
030:43:34|C|Pet|Affirmative.
030:46:07|T|CDR|Houston, what's your best guess on how long this baby will get to 2.7 if it started off at 0.9?
030:46:13|C|Pet|Stand by 1. I'll get you a number. They're saying an hour and 50 minutes.
030:46:24|T|CDR|That's about what we - that's about what it looks like to me.
030:46:28|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
030:46:46|C|Pet|John, you using Charlie's wristwatch to get that number?
030:46:53|T|CDR|No, I was just remembering how small that tunnel venthole is.
030:46:57|C|Pet|Roger.
030:46:57|P|PAO|<b>PAO</b> This is Apollo Control at 3 hours - at 30 hours, 52 minutes. It'll probably be on the order of two to two and a half hours from now before the Flight Dynamics Officer has sufficient tracking data to confirm that the midcourse correction had the desired effect. That being to lower the point of closest approach to the Moon from the value that we had prior to the maneuver of 117 nautical miles [217 kilometres] down to the desired altitude of 71 [nautical miles - 131 kilometres] and also to place the spacecraft arrival time at the desired Flight Plan time. The preliminary numbers however did appear to be normal and we'll be confirming that with tracking data. At the present time the crew is beginning preparations for entering the Lunar Module. This is for the second time and at present they are venting the tunnel, the docking tunnel between the LM and the command module. So that they have a differential pressure of about 2.7 pounds per square inch [19 kilopascals], between the tunnel and the Command Module. The Command Module's cabin pressure is somewhere around 5 to 5 and 1/2 pounds per square inch [35 to 38 kilopascals]. This venting is being done to remove as much of the atmosphere from the LM as possible within a reasonable amount of time. The first time that we went into the lunar module last night the atmosphere in the Command Module still contains a small percentage of nitrogen of course. At launch, we're launching 60% oxygen, 40% nitrogen, and this is gradually replaced with pure oxygen in the Command Module. By going into the Lunar Module, earlier than normal, the amount of nitrogen that's allowed into the Lunar Module is greater than normal and therefore in order to have the oxygen content in the LM as close to pure oxygen as possible we are venting the lunar module down, the cabin will then be pumped up again prior to ingress, with pure oxygen and using this procedure we remove as much of the nitrogen as possible from the Lunar Module cabin. The estimate on this venting procedure is that it would require about an hour and a half. And we don't expect this to have any effect on the Flight Plan schedule for the crews' entering the Lunar Module. This should occur as it is planned in the Flight Plan. At the present time Apollo 16 is 120,000 nautical miles [222,240 kilometres] from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is down now to 4,486 feet [1,367 metres] per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>PAO</b> This is Apollo Control at 3 hours - at 30 hours, 52 minutes.

031:53:11|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're up to 2.1 on the LM/CM Delta-P gauge now.
031:53:16|C|Pet|Roger. Copy 2.1. And while I'm talking to you on this oxygen-tank pressure gauge, it's starting to look like there is a bias in there of about 14.7 [psi - 101 kilopascals] due to the fact that the reference chamber has apparently leaked its 1 atmosphere reference value down to probably vacuum. And that, coupled with a 5-psi [35 kilopascals] meter bias, should give you a total bias of about 20 psi [138 kilopascals] on the oxygen-tank pressure. But the gauge seems to be working okay except for that bias, so we're going to continue to follow it so we can give you a - maybe a better number prior to LOI.
031:54:08|T|CDR|Thank you, Pete.
031:54:10|C|Pet|Roger.
031:54:27|T|LMP|Houston, 16. Over.
031:54:29|C|Pet|Go ahead.
031:54:32|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. I just took my windowshade out of my rendezvous window and, looking out at Quad 1 of old Orion, the thermal shield that sits directly inboard of the - the - of the - of the quad - it's facing the plus-Z direction. It's a little piece about three feet long by about a foot wide [0.3 by 0.9 metres]; it's beginning to peel off also, now. Over.
031:55:02|C|Pet|It's doing the same thing as the - as the panel we were - we looked at last night, huh?
031:55:08|T|LMP|That's affirm, except for - It - it's not nearly as bad, and it's just primarily on the inboard side, but it is beginning to get the shredded wheat appearance like the other one. Over.
031:55:16|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
031:55:28|T|LMP|Pete, on the outboard side [clears throat] right out near the quad - or right above the quad - on that same panel, it - it seems to me it's beginning - it looks like it starts out with a very fine, shaggy-grass-type stuff, and then slowly peels up into the shredded-wheat type. Over.
031:56:13|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
032:03:06|C|Pet|16, Houston. When you get a minute, we've got a - an addition to the Flight Plan at 32:48.
032:03:36|T|CDR|Roger. Go ahead with your 32:48 addition.
032:03:40|C|Pet|Okay. We want to add a note to read the LM/CM Delta-P.

032:04:06|T|CDR|Okey dokey.
032:04:17|C|Pet|And, Ken, that - we've made an ink correction on the back of that AOS/LOS Sun-wheel aid there. And when you get around to digging that out, I can give it to you, or I can pick it up later.
032:04:37|T|CDR|Ken's busy right now. Say again. Over.
032:04:40|C|Pet|Okay, on the back of the Sun wheel - the AOS/LOS Sun wheel - we've entered an ink note to account for the fact that we change REFSSMAT in the middle of his work there. We made an error on it. We've got to change the note now, and sometime when he's got that wheel out, I can read him up the correction.

This would be a quad adjacent to the Commander's station in the crew compartment. And Duke said that there were about three square feet of surface area involved. He described the appearance of the surface about as the other surface which had also peeled. Ranging from what he said was a kind of a sprouting grass appearance to shredded wheat. Now at the present time, the crew is awaiting the pressure differential between the docking tunnel and the Command Module to reach 2.7 lbs per sq. inch [18.6 kilopascals].

032:05:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours, 26 minutes. Here in the control center the Lunar Module control officer has replayed the tape of Charlie Duke's description of the additional surface of the LM that appeared to be peeling. Where the paint was peeling, similar to the way panels below the docking target were reported peeling yesterday. From Duke's description, we were not able to pin point the precise panels involved although it is obviously very close to the area that was reported peeling previously, and appeared much the same from Duke's description. The paint which is painted on the very thin aluminum skin in this area of the LM to provide a small margin of additional thermal protection in worse case conditions where the Lunar Module is exposed to greater sun angles than we will be seeing on this mission, the paint on those surfaces is as Duke described them, giving the appearance of sprouting grass and then peeling back even further and giving the appearance of shredded wheat. Duke said that the area involved is about 1 feet by - 1 foot by 3 feet [0.3 by 0.9 metres]. And was in the area of Quad 1, which is one of the Reaction Control Systems thrusters quads located adjacent to the commander's station in the Lunar Module ascent stage. General Jim McDivitt, who is in the control center at the present time, advised Pete Frank that the studies that Grumman has done, the manufacturer of the Lunar Module, show that even if all of the surfaces on the LM which are painted in this manner were to lose their paint, that the effect would be minimal and would cause no concern as far the temperatures of the Lunar Module are concerned. We expect that we will get further information at the time the crew enters the Lunar Module and also we will be looking at all of the pertinent systems; all of the critical systems aboard the Lunar Module and are getting a comparative set of numbers to go with those that we saw last night.

032:49:00|C|Pet|Roger; stand by a minute.
032:52:00|C|Pet|16, we want to continue TM venting until you have ar - a reading - Delta-P reading of 3.4 [psi - 23 kilopascals] on the meter, and that should take less than ten minutes.
032:52:17|T|LMP|Okay, we copy. We'll go to 3.4.
032:52:36|T|CDR|Okay, we're in Vent.
032:52:38|C|Pet|Roger.
032:57:03|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, it's an honest 3.4.

032:57:20|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 32 hours, 58 minutes. The LM cabin has now been vented down to the desired pressure level and the crew will shortly begin repressurizing the cabin to about 5 to 5½ pounds per square inch. Following that they will be preparing to enter the Lunar Module. I expect that will require about five to ten minutes. The Flight Plan calls for them to be in the LM by about 33 hours and five minutes or about seven or eight minutes from now. They will have to remove the tunnel hatch, the probe and drogue assembly, and then crawl through the tunnel into the Lunar Module. Following that they have about 30 minutes or so of housekeeping activities aboard the LM and then they will activate the communications system and run a series of communications checks with Mission Control. Our LM systems engineer has just reported that they are beginning the activities toward repressurizing the Lunar Module. During this entry into the LM they will also be powering up the data systems that will allow us to get a good look at all of the major systems on the Lunar Module through the telemetry and we'll have teams of engineers here in Mission Control and in the engineering support rooms in Building 45 here at Manned Spacecraft Center looking at this data very closely and comparing it with the similar measurements that we got yesterday from the crew that made their unscheduled, previously unscheduled entry into the LM. At the present time Apollo 16 is 125,324 nautical miles [232,100 kilometres] from Earth and we are continuing to watch the spacecraft velocity drop off. It is down to 4,310 feet [1,313 metres] per second. </p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 32 hours, 58 minutes.

033:24:48|T|CMP|And, Don, I'm holding off on the oxygen heaters. I'm keeping them all three in Auto until we get the surge and repress tanks built back up. If' that's okay, if you would like for me to turn them off, I can reconfigure now; otherwise, I would like you to help me remember not to leave them on.
033:25:08|C|Pet|Roger, we concur, Ken. We'll remind you.
033:25:17|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
033:53:57|T|CMP|Hey, Don, can I talk to you about the docking latch?
033:54:03|C|Pet|Roger.
033:54:08|T|CMP|You all set, or do you want me to wait a minute?
033:54:10|C|Pet|No, go ahead.
033:54:13|T|CMP|Okay, you remember we told you at the time we - that we docked that we had a Number 10 [latch] that didn't look like it had stroked quite the same as the others; but the lock was over the - over the rail.
033:54:27|C|Pet|Right.
033:54:28|T|CMP|You weren't on board at the time, that's right, we were talking to Gordy -
033:54:30|C|Pet|Right.
033:54:31|T|CMP|But that's one of the things we reported and the plate that goes over the bungee fairing is cocked slightly. And now that we've got everything cleaned out of the tunnel, I can look in here. It's real obvious that the bungee hasn't fired completely. It's down; the top of the bungee is recessed about a half of an inch down. It looks like it just hadn't triggered and, as a matter of fact, I'm looking at the latch and, by golly, I can see between the latch and the total ring, so it didn't even pull down against that. And I really obviously don't have any concern for it; except I'm - I've never seen one that looked just like this and I was gonna go ahead and recock it and fire it again and see how that worked with a manual trigger. But I got to thinking maybe that's - maybe it's best to let you folks think about it. The main thing I want to do is make sure it's not a problem in unlatching it when the time comes.
033:55:36|C|Pet|Roger; stand by.
033:56:57|C|Pet|Casper, we capt - we got all the data we need and we're going to take a look at it. We do not want you to recock and fire the thing manually and we'll get back to you later.
033:57:06|T|CMP|Okay.
033:58:31|T|CMP|And, Houston, Casper turned over the power supply to Orion at 33:58.
033:58:43|C|Pet|Roger, Casper.
033:58:43|P|PAO|With Ken Mattingly's report that he turned over power to the LM, which came at 33 hours, 58 minutes, we would expect shortly to begin seeing telemetry data from the Lunar Module. Also Mattingly commented on a problem that had been reported previously and that is that one of the 12 docking latches, on the Command Module, apparently has not latched firmly around the docking ring of the Lunar Module, as would normally be expected. This doesn't constitute any concern; three of these 12 docking latches are adequate to assure a hard dock, and only one of the 12 is not latched down firmly. The belief at the present time is that it's probably just hung up if the thing were fired again that it would engauge fully. And it doesn't appear that any thing further will be done with this particular latch. The expectation is that when the two vehicles are separated and then docked again that the latch will perform properly. And as we mentioned in any event only three of the 12 latches are required for a hard docking. Well we have now started getting LM data, so we will be taking a good look at all of the systems on the Lunar Module.</p> <a name="034_02_02"></a>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> With Ken Mattingly's report that he turned over power to the LM, which came at 33 hours, 58 minutes, we would expect shortly to begin seeing telemetry data from the Lunar Module.

035:14:18|T|LMP|Minus. Roger; minus 0118.9.
035:14:22|C|Pet|That's affirmative. Yeah.
035:14:29|T|LMP|Is that because we took the film over there?
035:14:36|C|Pet|Say again, Charlie.
035:14:38|T|LMP|I said we took all that film over there, maybe that's the 30 pounds.
035:14:42|C|Pet|Affirmative, that's where it came from.
035:15:11|C|Pet|And, 16, we still have this note to go on the Sun wheel.
035:15:24|T|CDR|Stand by.
035:16:54|C|Pet|I need Charlie, 16.
035:45:16|C|Pet|16, your rates are okay, any time you want to go into PTC.
035:45:28|T|CMP|Okay, Pete. Thank you.

037:19:21|C|Pet|Okay, just a last few words here. We don't have anything for you except one note to Ken. Earlier you asked about whether or not the pad we read you contained the correct bias for the EMS; we told you it did, and we've looked at it a little more now, and actually it turns out it did not. The bias on that one was less than a foot per second, I guess. In the future, we will include that bias in the pads.
037:19:52|T|CDR|Okay, thank you now.

038:06:09|C|Har|Okay. Much better now, Ken.
038:06:14|T|CMP|Okay. I say - I got a film status report for you. And I'd like to ask you a question about the optics. I'd like to stow the optics instead of leaving them up, unless the temperatures are gonna get too high. And the reason for this is that every time we run around past the Sun, it's like throwing a spotlight inside.
038:06:39|C|Har|Roger. Stand by.
038:07:03|C|Har|Okay, Ken, go ahead with your film status, and we're looking at that stowing the optics.
038:07:16|T|CMP|Okay, the magazine OO reads 26, magazine November November is either 33 or 34, depending on how you look at it. We finished up the 16-millimeter mag on Alfa Alfa by taking some pictures of the - part of the LM paint that we think is shredding. Magazine Oscar and November have been used just for the targeted pictures - no extras. And I guess that's - We didn't take any other original pictures today except for the AA frames on the LM. Tomorrow we'll try to get some interior photography.
038:08:06|C|Har|Okay. Copy 26 frames on Oscar Oscar. The November November report we got last night was 33 frames. You didn't use any of it today?
038:08:18|T|CMP|Well, just for that UV. So whatever it was last night, it must be one more.
038:08:25|C|Har|Okay. 34.
038:08:25|||<p class="tech"><b>038 09 Oh Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, it's okay to stow the optics.
038:09:10|T|CMP|Okay, Henry, thank you. And I'd like to go ahead and take the voice comm down before I turn the optics power off. I wanted to try to take one last look and see if I can pick up one of the planets as we turn around, and I'd like to go ahead and knock off the voice.
038:09:37|C|Har|Okay, Ken, get the voice down and have a good night.
038:09:43|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. See you in the morning. Good night, sir.
038:19:55|T|CMP|Houston, Casper.
038:19:57|C|Har|Hello, Casper, go ahead.
038:20:02|T|CMP|Okay, I'm not sure what just happened. I just saw - down looking at the optics and all of a sudden I saw a warning light and I got a No Attitude and a Gimbal Lock light. And my - my ball seems to, in fact - it looks like the platform may be frozen. Although we're still - still in PTC here.
038:20:34|C|Har|Okay, we're seeing some telemetry. We saw something about the time you come on the line there.
038:20:42|T|CMP|Okay. And it shows the CDUs down there in Noun 20 as being gimbal locked.
038:21:13|C|Har|Stand by a little bit, Ken. We're retaking a look at the telemetry.
038:21:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 38 hours, 22 minutes. That was Ken Mattingly reporting what appears to be a problem in the Guidance and Navigation System on the Command Module.

038:25:19|C|Har|Ken, just so we can make sure we got it straight down here, could you run through again what you were doing, and then the sequence of events?
038:25:29|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, l'm not real sure when this happened. I was trying to see if I couldn't pick up one of the planets in the optics, and I was using P52. And I had gone in and I was calling Option 3 and then putting in planet vectors out of the Flight Plan and I tried - I thought I was going to catch, I guess it was Saturn And it looked like I had just missed it. And I was driving around just kind of looking around to see what I could see in the sky and waiting to try and pick up Jupiter. And somewhere in there, I guess I came down to zero the optics or do something, and then I looked down and saw I had a PGNCS light. And I guess I had just- recently - I guess I was about ready to give up on it and call P00; and I think I had - in fact, I think I called P00 at or just before the time I - we ended up with the Gimbal Lock and the No Attitude. That was just a couple of seconds or so, I guess, before I called you about it, maybe 15 seconds or so.
038:26:85|C|Har|Okay, You got a Gimbal Lock -
038:26:46|T|CMP|I can't, think of any combination of DSKY inputs - I was trying to think if I could have made some combination of DSKY inputs that might of - Had I gotten in almost the right inputs that I could have caused the problem, but I don't see where I was using any verbs or nouns that could have done this.
038:27:11|C|Har|Okay, you got a Gimbal Lock and No Att. Did you get an ISS warning?
038:27:19|T|CMP|No, sir; I did not.
038:27:22|C|Har|... good.
038:27:28|T|CMP|And the Noun 20s were approximately correct for both pitch and roll, although the middle gimbal angle was completely out to lunch.
038:32:44|T|CMP|Houston, Casper.
038:32:48|C|Har|Go ahead, Ken.
038:32:55|T|CMP|I'd like for you to think about the effects of having me go ahead and do a Verb 41 Noun 20 to match up with the SCS. That thing's been drifting a good bit, but, in any case, maybe I can get it close enough to have a starting point to try and pick up some things. I'd been looking in the - had been looking in the telescope just before this all happened, and there's so much of this - so many of these little particles cut there that chances of recognizing a star pattern are extremely dubious, I'd like to try. And maybe we can work on something like the Earth, maybe the Sun, or something like that.
038:33:35|T|MCC [not CapCom]|Go G&amp;C.
038:33:38|C|Har|Okay, standby.
038:33:41|T|MCC [not CapCom]|Okay. Do you want to stand by on this Verb 41 Noun 20 until you get your Gimbal Lock removed? Okay, CapCom tell him we're working up - Thank you.
038:34:12|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We'd like you to hold up on the Verb 41 Noun 20. We're working on a procedure to try to get rid of the gimbal lock.
038:34:23|T|CMP|Okay. Did you have any data coming down at the time this all happened, or were you in the blind?
038:34:31|C|Har|Roger. We had good high bit rate data, and they're poring over that now.
038:34:39|T|CMP|Okay. I'll sit tight then. Thank you.
038:36:44|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
038:36:49|T|CMP|Go ahead.
038:36:50|C|Har|Okay. We want to try to get the platform inertial again, and what we'd like for you to do is a Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter, Enter, Verb 40 Enter.
038:37:07|T|CMP|Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter. Then you want me to put plus Enter into that register. Okay, that got rid of the Gimbal Lock light. Now you'd like for me to do a Verb 41?
038:37:28|C|Har|Verb 40 Enter.
038:37:33|T|CMP|Okay. Verb 40 Enter.
038:37:46|C|Har|Okay. Our data shows the platform's inertial now, Ken.
038:37:57|T|CMP|Roger. And it appears that way from here, too.
038:38:12|C|Har|Okay. Ken, you can go ahead now with you Verb 41 Noun 20.
038:38:23|T|CMP|Okay. This will be a coarse align to the GDC angles, is that correct?
038:38:26|C|Har|That's affirmative.
038:38:53|C|Har|Ken, hold up on that Verb 41 just a second.
038:38:59|T|CMP|Wilco. I'll go ahead and load it but won't enter.
038:39:04|C|Har|Okay. Guidance has got a little thing they're looking at and talking to people in the back room, little discussion going on here.

036:56:46|T|CMP|Hank, if it doesn't clear up, I won't be able to find any stars with no closer alignment than I have on this thing. Looks like I'm gonna have to get a - a coarser alignment by using some big objects like Earth or something like that.
038:57:01|C|Har|Okay. Are those particles out there giving you a lot of trouble?
038:57:07|T|CMP|That's all there is. They're just everywhere.
038:57:20|T|CMP|When you combine them with the limited area that you have to look in because of the LM reflections, you find the telescope to be very unsatisfying.

039:06:53|C|Har|Go ahead.
039:06:57|T|CMP|Okay. I used the Earth and the Sun, and I got four balls 7, which I think is gonna be a significant improvement. I'd like to go ahead and see what those torquing angles turn out to be.
039:07:09|C|Har|Roger. We concur.
039:07:13|T|CMP|Okay. That looks about right for the amount that I had to correct for. It's - it's kind of hard to mark on the Earth because you have to guess where the - where the - the terminator really ought to be.

039:13:30|C|Har|Okay; we concur, Ken. Don't torque those. And we want to check a few switches. They're working on now getting a switch checklist, and then we're going to let you get some rest and smoke the data over during the night and have it stored for you in the morning.
039:13:45|T|CMP|Okay. Can you give me any - Can you give me any cursory ideas of that, just the same - if there's any possibility I entered something inadvertently? Or does it take too long to sort all that out?
039:14:01|C|Har|Okay. The preliminary look here - We think it's a hardware problem, Ken. Some sort of a transient problem, and when we get the data in here, we'll be able to tell a little more about it.
039:14:16|T|CMP|Okay. Guess I'm sorry to hear that.
039:14:19|C|Har|They - they don't think at this point that it's anything that you did, and it appears to be a transient problem, but we won't know until we take a look at it.
039:14:29|T|CMP|Okay. Let me give you one other little tidbit that now seems to be somewhat more of - of interest than it was before, and that's that when I take this Optics Zero to Zero, the area around the shaft peapack [?] makes a lot of - a lot more noise than the one in the trunnion. It seems to me that it's making more noise now than it used to. When I say used to, when we first started out - when we first started out, they were very, very quiet and you couldn't even hear them running. And now they're getting noisier. And that may be typical, but it's just one more thing that - I guess we'll throw out all these things. I'll try to minimize the number the times I Zero the Optics, at least with the Zero switch. I'll use Manual wherever possible.
039:15:23|C|Har|Okay. That only occurs when you're zeroing?
039:15:29|T|CMP|That's affirmative. Well, actually, Hank, I just tried it in Manual. It occurs when - the noise occurs whenever I'm in an extremely high rate. You know, like using high in a max shaft rate.
039:15:52|C|Har|Roger; copy.
039:16:37|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We'd like to check some switches up on Panel 1.

This being the case, we will go over and recount the activities that have just taken place regarding the Guidance and Navigation System. It - this activity was spurred when Mattingly saw a Gimbal Lock warning light on board and a No Attitude light on board. This was verified by the Mission Control Team here on the ground. The first step taken, the IMU was coarse aligned to the spacecraft body. When this occurred, this alignment wiped out the roll attitude in reference. The first step, Mattingly was given the go ahead to unlock the platform with ground procedures, and this allowed the platform to go inertial. Initially, he tried to align the platform with stars. He was unsuccessful with the platform alignment with stars and this - primarily because of the debris around the spacecraft. As the next step, he then used the Sun and Moon to align the platform and was very successful in this effort. Then the platform was tweaked in its alignment using the stars; and this was possible because the platform alignment with the initial planet reference was good enough to use the Auto Optics. Here in Mission Control during this shift, we will be playing the recorded data, and this will be evaluated over the course of the shift. Initially, it appears to be a transient problem.

046:00:27|C|Pet|Roger.
046:00:37|C|Pet|Okay, 16. The gimbal lock and the coarse align that you had back at 38 plus 18 [GET] was caused by a CDU transient in the yaw axis. The transient was induced when the TVC relay was disabled. And this relay is normally enabled when the Optics is in Manual and disabled when you select P00, and that's kind of the situation that you're in when that occurred. And Ken had just selected P00, and he had, prior to that, been using the Optics in Manual. And they say that this type transient has been observed in CSM 117 [Apollo 17] testing, and we're presently looking at - a software work-around for LOI. And we'll get some more words to you later on this - on this same subject.

046:02:36|C|Pet|16, in the situation we're in now, we've only got one omni that we can read, and we can't command. So we're only getting about 11 minutes of low-bit rate data out of every 18 while you're in PTC. It's possible - we might lose you; if so, just stand by and we'll pick you up again.
046:02:57|T|LMP|Okay. We're ready for that command test, Pete.
046:03:02|C|Pet|Okay.
046:03:12|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. We're gonna go one step at a time. First thing we want to do is Up Telemetry, Command Reset and then Normal.
046:03:25|T|LMP|Okay. I can give you - You want a Command Reset and then Normal?
046:03:32|C|Pet|Charlie, we want the Up Telemetry Command switch to Reset and then Normal.
046:03:42|T|LMP|Roger. It's Reset, Normal.
046:03:48|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. Stand by. We're gonna try some command.
046:04:09|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. That apparently didn't work. We're going on in. But we want to cycle the Up Telemetry switch Off for three seconds and then back to Normal.
046:04:22|T|LMP|Roger. In work.
046:04:30|T|LMP|Okay, you're back to Normal.
046:04:30|||<p class="tech"><b>046 O4 35 Peterson:</b> Okay. We're trying commands now, Charlie. Stand by.
046:04:52|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. That apparently cleared it up.
046:04:59|T|LMP|Okay.
046:05:03|C|Pet|And, Charlie, we've got commands again. We'll handle the antenna and the bit rate for you now.
046:05:09|T|LMP|Okay, fine.
046:05:21|C|Pet|To repeat an old phrase, Charlie, we had a lot of people down here turning blue on this - until that - until that last little situation got cured there.
046:05:32|T|LMP|Was that that IMU problem?
046:05:35|C|Pet|No, the - the - comm problem.
046:05:39|T|LMP|Well, you could put Fendell in the backup mode and just put him up on top of the building.
046:06:01|C|Pet|We may have to put him up there anyway, Charlie.
046:06:06|T|LMP|(Laughter) Afraid so.
046:18:50|C|Pet|16, Houston. I've got about three - a couple, three updates to the Flight Plan. Whenever you're - it's convenient for you, we'll read them up.
046:36:08|T|CMP|Don, you about ready for a little status report?
046:36:14|C|Pet|Stand by a minute, Ken.
046:36:19|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. We're all set. Go ahead.
046:36:44|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. We're all set.
046:36:45|T|CMP|Houston. Casper.
046:36:52|C|Pet|Casper Houston. How do you read me?
046:37:10|C|Pet|Casper Houston. How do you read?
046:37:32|C|Pet|Casper Houston. How do you read me?
046:38:19|C|Pet|Casper Houston. Do you read?
046:38:37|T|CMP|Houston. Casper.
046:38:39|C|Pet|Casper we read you loud and clear. Do you read me?
046:39:07|C|Pet|Casper Houston. How do you read?
046:39:20|T|CMP|Houston. Casper. Over.
046:39:24|C|Pet|Casper we read you. Do you read us?
046:40:09|T|CMP|Houston. if you're reading Casper, we're transmitting in the blind. We have signal strength on the meter of about 60 percent. We're not receiving you and, based on your comment about the antennas, we'll wait about five minutes and then try again before we change the configuration.
046:40:43|C|Pet|16, you're loud and clear. Do you read Houston?
046:46:08|C|Pet|Casper, Houston.
046:46:15|T|CMP|Roger. We lost you there for a while there, Don.
046:46:19|C|Pet|Roger. You're loud and clear now. Do you read me okay?
046:46:24|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
046:46:26|C|Pet|Roger. You were loud and clear all the time. Apparently, you just lost us.
046:46:53|C|Pet|And, 16, the comm problem may have been on the ground. We'll try to find out and let you know in a minute.
046:47:09|T|CMP|Roger.
046:47:19|T|CMP|The background tone at the - the background noise that the system is making right now is a little different than it was making before, if that would help you figure out what the problem was. It's almost like it wasn't up-linking, maybe.
046:47:38|C|Pet|Roger, 16.
046:47:43|T|CMP|Okay, Don; and, if you're ready, I'll give you some status reports.
046:47:48|C|Pet|Stand by just a minute, Ken.
046:48:14|C|Pet|Okay, Casper, go ahead with your status report.
046:48:22|T|CMP|Okay. I'm using that famous old trick on how to get someone to talk to you, by every time I pick up a juice bag and get halfway down, why it seems like we are able to establish comm. So I'll start with the Commander's list and I'll go through and I'll skip the menus since they're on separate pages and come back to them. So let's start with A-1: 22035; Alfa 3: 7, good; Alfa 4: none; Alfa 5: 19, 15, 18; Alfa 6: 6, 5, 6, and 3. That's a total of four. Going to Bravo. Bravo 1: 15035; 6: good --that's on Bravo 3. Bravo 4: none; Bravo 5: 10, 30, 25; Bravo 6: 2, 2, and 5. Charlie 1: 21059; Charlie 3: 7, good; Charlie 4: none; Charlie 5: 15, 30; Charlie 6: 7, 7, 5, 5, 5. Okay, and if you want the menu stuff, I'll go back to that now.
046:50:36|C|Pet|Okay, go ahead.
046:50:55|T|CMP|Okay. For John, and that's day 2, Meal B, scratch the bread and peanut butter. On Meal C, scratch the frankfurters; add an orange drink.
046:51:50|T|CMP|Okay, on Bravo 2. Are you still there, Don?
046:51:58|C|Pet|Affirmative; we're getting a lot of background noise. 16, hold off a minute -
046:52:03|T|CMP|Okay, ... keep on going.
046:52:04|C|Pet|- we'll switch omnis ... Hold off a minute, 16; we'll switch omnis.
046:54:19|C|Pet|Okay, Casper. Go ahead.
046:54:26|T|CMP|Okay, just a second.
046:54:39|T|CMP|Okay, starting on - Where did you copy last?
046:54:44|C|Pet|Okay, we got John, day 2, Meal Charlie complete, and we're ready, I guess, for Bravo.
046:54:54|T|CMP|Okay, Bravo 2. On Meal A, you can scratch sausage patties and - orange juice - and fruit cocktail.
046:55:37|T|CMP|On Bravo, that's Meal B, you can scratch turkey and gravy, vanilla pudding, bread, peanut butter. Meal C, you can scratch the chocolate pudding.
046:56:13|T|CMP|Going to Charlie 2.
046:56:16|C|Pet|Okay.
046:56:19|T|CMP|On meal A, scratch the sausage patties. Meal B, you can scratch the bread and peanut butter. Meal C, you can delete two of the frankfurters and scratch the chocolate pudding.
046:56:40|C|Pet|Okay, Casper, we copied all that.
046:56:46|T|CMP|Okay, and a couple of other words here on the - We got ALFMED coming up; and, to date, Charlie saw some flashes the other night and not a whole heck of a lot of them last night. And I'm not sure I have seen any at all yet, and John may or may not. So, what we thought we'd do here is - We've got a little more house cleaning to do here and finish our chores. And we'll probably take a look at what we see, and if Charlie is seeing sufficient - you know, enough flashes that he's pretty sure he's seeing thing, why, we'll go and run the experiment now. And if we aren't seeing a sufficient number to look like it justifies sitting here for an hour with it, why, what would you think about saving it until such time as it looks like maybe we see more of them?
046:57:45|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. We'll - we'll think on that a little. And also, I've got a note on the Nikon camera light meter here in connection with the ALFMED photography.
046:58:02|T|CMP|Okay, stand by another second.
046:58:15|C|Pet|Ken, you don't really need to copy much, I think. If you've got the camera handy there where you can look at it, I can give it to you in a few words.
046:58:24|T|CMP|You know one of the things we need in this program is some octopuses.
046:58:29|C|Pet|Roger.
046:58:57|T|CMP|Okay, Don, I don't have the camera out, but how about just reading to me whatever it is you want to say. I'll write it down here.
046:59:05|C|Pet|Okay. It's not - it's probably not worth writing down except maybe a little note to remind you the - the camera was observed to hang up in the Battery Check position full down, when you hit the camera light meter On, Check. And what we want you to do is - the little button on top of the camera there has a while band around the base of it - they want to make sure that white line is visible on the light meter switch button. If it's not visible, you can take your fingernail and catch the top of that button and pull out on it until the white line is visible. And then, verify that the meter is operating by holding the camera up to a light and observing the meter response to varying light level.
046:59:53|T|CMP|Roger. We'll make sure it works before we use it.
046:59:57|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. That's all I've got on that one.
047:02:44|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
047:02:46|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
047:02:50|T|LMP|Roger. Flash, with a hot report here. Pass on to the chefs that the grits were delicious.
047:02:59|C|Pet|Say again, Charlie. I didn't copy that.
047:03:04|T|LMP|I say, pass on to the chefs that the grits were delicious.
047:03:07|C|Pet|Roger; will do. And for Ken's information, the status report that we just got was excellent as far as format, readability, and everything. The - Doc said he really appreciates it.
047:03:25|T|CMP|Always glad to help.
047:03:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. 47 hours and 27 minutes into the mission of Apollo 16. Crew awake now, presumably conducting either the ALFMED experiment or beyond the eat period. As a matter of fact, part of their first activities after wakeup was the status report, which [lists] all the parts not eaten; in other words, negative reporting on the meals for the three crewmen are read down. Also the problems with the commanding through the omni antennas have cleared themselves up, with the crew cycling a switch Off to back On again, which cleared the logic in the switching circuit. And everything is properly working now in that area. As soon as the crew completes the current housekeeping activities, the trouble shooting procedures for the inertial measuring unit and the Guidance and Control System, Guidance and Navigation System will be read up to the crew, and they'll pursue that problem.

047:33:36|C|Pet|Go ahead.
047:33:39|T|LMP|Okay, Pete, I'm up on biomed. How does it look?
047:33:45|C|Pet|Stand by one.
047:34:29|C|Pet|Okay, the biomed data looks good.
047:34:35|T|LMP|Okay, thank you.
047:34:41|T|CDR|You can tell Charlie's still breathing, huh?
047:34:45|C|Pet|It looks that way.
047:34:51|T|CDR|We've been suspecting it up here all along.
047:34:55|C|Pet|Roger.
047:35:44|T|CDR|Houston, based on the burn yesterday, is the data you gave us for the SPS burn card still going to hold for LOI?
047:35:55|C|Pet|Stand by a minute.
047:36:00|T|CDR|And the other question is, does it look like we're going to have another midcourse, and which one and how much is it?
047:36:07|C|Pet|Okay, we'll get back to you in a minute.
047:36:12|T|CDR|Okay, thank you, Pete.
047:36:41|C|Pet|Okay, 16. On the burn card, we will probably have to do some more updating, we'll get to that tomorrow. And on the midcourses, Midcourse 4, right now, is - looks like it's less than one foot per second. If it gets much bigger, we'll probably do it. But we'll advise you.
047:37:04|T|CDR|Houston, 16. You're breaking up badly. How do you read us? Over.
047:37:16|T|CMP|..., Pete, you probably read us loud and clear in the ... mode ...
047:37:15|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston, ... Say again on all ... on the burn card.
047:38:08|C|Pet|Okay, 16, if you read. We probably will have to do some updating on that - on that pad. And we'll let you know on that and we'll update it tomorrow. And on the Midcourse 4 - Midcourse 4 is looking pretty small, less than one foot per second now. If it gets larger, we'll probably go ahead and do it, but we'll keep you advised on it.
047:38:43|T|CMP|Houston, your up-link keeps fading in and out on you.
047:38:50|C|Pet|Roger, 16, We're switching on you.
047:38:51|T|CDR|... fading ...
047:39:10|T|CDR|Houston, 16. Do you read us now?
047:39:12|C|Pet|I read you loud and clear. Do you read me?
047:39:17|T|CDR|And I read you same. You faded cut on your last transmission again.
047:39:23|C|Pet|Okay, hang on a minute until the comm clears up a little bit and then I'll come back to you.
047:39:29|T|CDR|Okay.
047:39:44|C|Pet|Okay, 16. Let's try it again. On that updating the pad, we'll get that to you tomorrow. And right now, Midcourse 4 looks very small, less than one foot per second. If it gets larger, we will probably do it, but we'll keep you advised on that.
047:40:01|T|CDR|Outstanding.
047:40:16|T|CDR|Just to review that SPS pressure system - as near as I can make out, it's purely - we don't actually have a Delta-P. It's just - of about more than five psi. What we do have is a gage difference. Is that not correct?
047:40:41|C|Pet|That's affirmative, John. There's a - there's a chamber in there - a reference chamber that's supposed to be at atmospheric pressure. It has apparently vented to a vacuum condition, which brings in about - about a 14.7-psi bias. Then there's a 5-psi meter bias on top of that.
047:41:01|T|CDR|Okay, so actually, the two meters, as we look at them now, are actually balanced. Is that not correct?
047:41:08|C|Pet|I believe that's correct.
047:41:12|T|CDR|Okay.
047:41:20|C|Pet|John, the actual pressures on both meters - the actual pressures are the same, although the meters are reading differently.
047:41:29|T|CDR|Okay, we got the message.
047:44:01|T|LMP|Houston, 16. Will we need to charge Battery B, just looking ahead in the Flight Plan a little bit?
047:44:07|C|Pet|Just a moment.
047:44:36|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie, you can go ahead and start charging the battery now.
047:44:45|T|LMP|Roger.
047:47:31|T|LMP|Okay, Pete, Bat B's on charge now.
047:47:35|C|Pet|Understand. Bat B on charge.
048:00:25|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
048:00:28|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
048:00:32|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. We got you - Finally had time to look out the window and you're just coming into view again and just as pretty as ever.
048:00:43|C|Pet|Very nice. What you looking at right now?
048:00:53|C|Pet|Can you tell what part of the Earth?
048:00:54|T|LMP|We've got a half-Earth. Say again?
048:00:58|C|Pet|Can you yell what part of the Earth you're looking at?
048:01:03|T|LMP|Well, we got half-Earth, and we see a land mass - see the North Pole - the north polar cap with two big swirls coming out off of it to the southwest. I can see the subsolar point very distinctly. It's a big white dot in the center towards the LM, away from the terminator. And there's a big land mass that's visible in the center. And - can't really make out exactly what it is. It's clear of clouds, though. It's the only place that's fairly clear.
048:01:44|C|Pet|Okay, we show you directly over North Africa. And that's just about the terminator.
048:02:00|T|LMP|Okay, you got North Africa at the terminator?
048:02:04|C|Pet|Just about.
048:02:06|T|LMP|Okay, that's what it is, then, looking at it, yeah. It's - it's Africa. Looks like a good storm system up in the Atlantic Ocean and above the subsolar point.
048:02:18|C|Pet|Roger.
048:02:45|T|LMP|The blue coloring - the white of the clouds and the blue of the ocean, Dick. Things just stayed pretty constant as we move out - still really a spectacular sight.
048:06:22|T|CDR|Houston, 16. Over.
048:06:24|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
048:06:30|T|CDR|What do they think of this PTC down there in the trenches?
048:06:35|C|Pet|It's looking real good.
048:06:44|T|CDR|It really does look good. I don't know who to congratulate, Ken or the computer.
048:07:13|C|Pet|I guess we'll give Ken credit for that one.
048:07:24|T|CDR|Darn right.
048:08:31|C|Pet|16, let us know what you think about the number of light flashes and whether or not it's feasible to try the ALFMED.
048:08:40|T|CDR|Okay. That's in work right now.
048:08:43|C|Pet|Roger.
048:08:44|T|CDR|That is, if you can work on seeing flashes.
048:08:50|C|Pet|Right.
048:08:56|T|CDR|That's a low metabolic load.
048:09:01|C|Pet|Understand.
048:19:49|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're going to start on the ALFMED now. I guess it'll take us about an hour and a half from the time we start to the time we finish up.
048:20:02|C|Pet|Okay. And you think you are seeing enough light flashes to make it valid?
048:20:07|T|CDR|They haven't gotten around to doing that yet, but they're working on it.
048:20:12|C|Pet|Roger; understand.
048:20:13|T|CMP|Don, Charlie saw some this morning when he got up. And so we're going to put the ALMED on Charlie. And we will not turn it on until we start to see some flashes, and if we don't see any, we'll just terminate it. We'll wait some reasonable time, and we'll talk it over with you. We'll tell you when we're ready to go through it. That's our present plan.
048:20:39|C|Pet|Okay, Ken, we'll be standing by. And, Ken, while I'm talking to you, we've got a little more information on this platform problem and its a fairly big mouthful, so, sometime when you get a chance when you can copy some information, give me a call.
048:21:00|T|CMP|Okay. it looks like it'll be a couple of hours.
048:21:03|C|Pet|Roger. We don't want you to get into another P52 before we have time to talk about it.
048:21:10|T|CMP|All righty.
048:21:18|T|LMP|Pete, (clear's throat) a little background on these flashes ...
048:24:02|C|Pet|16, Houston. We missed your comments on the light flashes. You'd started to give them to us, and you were blocked out by noise.
048:24:13|T|LMP|Roger, Pete. I was just telling you - the first night - during the first sleep period, whatever that was GET, I saw numerous light flashes before going to sleep, probably a - as freq - as high as three or four a minute. The next morning, they were not as numerous as that, and then last night still not as numerous. This morning, I was perhaps seeing maybe one every couple of minutes or so. If that frequency repeats itself during this test, is that good enough to go ahead?
048:24:50|C|Pet|Stand by one, Charlie.
048:25:03|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. If you see one every minute or so, that's enough to go ahead.
048:25:09|T|LMP|Okay.
048:26:01|C|Pet|And, 16. At 48:30 in the Flight Plan, there's a line that says "Synchronize mission timer to CMC clock," and it is not required.
048:26:11|T|LMP|Okay.
048:26:12|T|CMP|Oh, that's great. Thank you. Hey, Don, is our comm gonna be good enough the way we're going here now for you to get the marks or are we gonna - shall we count on recording them on board too?
048:26:28|C|Pet|You better record on board as well.
048:26:34|T|CMP|Okay. You'll start the tape recorder, is that affirmative ?
048:25:39|C|Pet|Affirmative. Call us when you're ready.
048:26:41|T|LMP|Or you want us to do that?
048:26:42|T|CMP|Okay. We'll do that; thank you.
048:26:52|T|CMP|Okay, if at any time, the voice quality goes down, our procedures, as I understand them described, will - I'll knock off or I'll take Charlie's place here, and I'll knock off the observations and go to recording. And other than that, Charlie will be doing all the things that I was going to be doing. But, if you want us to record them in pen and ink at the same time, just give us a call.
048:27:20|C|Pet|Roger.
048:36:30|C|Pet|16, Houston. Voice check.
048:36:35|T|CDR|Loud and clear there, Pete.
048:36:40|C|Pet|Roger. You all were so quiet, you scared us.
048:36:51|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. I just got the ALFMED on and in position, and we're gonna see if we see anything.
048:36:58|C|Pet|Okay.
048:53:33|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
048:53:36|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
048:53:39|T|LMP|Okay. I've seen five in 15 minutes.
048:53:42|C|Pet|Five in 15 minutes, Charlie?
048:53:46|T|LMP|That's affirm.
048:53:50|C|Pet|Okay. Stand by a minute; we'll look at that.
048:53:52|T|CMP|Okay, Don. We were just about ready to call this thing off and try it another day. And then looked like Charlie was starting to see them at - at a pretty fair rate. That five in 15 minutes was like four in the last minute or so. And John has seen one; I have not seen yet. But sounds like Charlie is gonna be able to see these and I'm gonna go ahead and take the photographs and get - get all set and wait for your answer.
048:54:26|C|Pet|Okay. We've been advised that we do want to go ahead with the ALFMED experiment.
048:54:33|T|CMP|Okay. It's in work. I'll tell you when we're ready to start timing.
048:54:37|C|Pet|All righty.
048:54:41|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. They seem to come in clusters. You get one or two right after - and then - then nothing for a while.
048:54:50|C|Pet|Roger.
048:58:07|T|CMP|Hey, Don. Can you help us ... record our ... 12 ... 0.15, 1.2, ... at three feet shows Charlie in the ALFMED with his face sticking out. I'm taking a picture from the LEB looking up towards the center couch.
048:58:40|C|Pet|16, that was so garbled we didn't copy, so you're gonna have to say it again.
048:58:45|T|CMP|Did you copy that, Don?
048:58:47|C|Pet|Negative, Ken. We were in - had a lot of background noise, and we didn't get any of that.
048:58:52|T|CMP|Houston, Casper.
048:58:55|C|Pet|Casper, go ahead.
048:59:00|T|CMP|Did you copy comments about the film?
048:59:02|C|Pet|Negative; we did not. We had too much background noise. Can you say again?
048:59:09|T|CMP|Okay. I guess I'll write it down. I think that's faster after all.
048:59:13|C|Pet|Okay.
049:08:42|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We're ready to start. Could you make sure the tape recorder is running?
049:08:58|C|Pet|Ken, it's been running awhile. We're going to rewind it, and I'll get it back to you in a minute.
049:09:12|C|Pet|In the meantime, Ken, if you've got comments we'll take them on air-to-ground.
049:09:21|T|CMP|Does that mean you want us to go ahead and start?
049:09:25|C|Pet|Affirmative.
049:09:33|T|CMP|Was that Roger or Stand by?
049:09:36|C|Pet|Affirmative; go ahead and start.
049:10:12|T|CMP|Okay, Don. We're running at 49:10.
049:10:16|C|Pet|Okay.
049:10:22|T|LMP|Mark. Okay, a bright dot in the - in my right eye in the upper - upper left center.

049:10:39|T|LMP|Mark. Bright dot in the left eye, upper left - right center.
049:11:11|T|LMP|Mark.
049:11:12|T|LMP|Mark. The first one was a fuzzy dot in the right eye - the left eye. The second one was a bright dot in the right eye, lower left center.
049:11:47|T|LMP|You copying, Houston?
049:11:49|C|Pet|Affirmative. We're copying.
049:12:02|C|Pet|DSE is now running.

049:29:15|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. We copied that.
049:30:00|T|LMP|Mark. Upper right eye going from left to right.
049:30:12|T|LMP|Light flash.
049:30:25|C|Pet|Okay. And, Charlie, if you see any more of the subtle marks, how about calling them and just call them a subtle mark. We'd like to record that information.

049:33:45|T|CDR|- Left, right, left. [?]. I got the impression it was moving toward me. Why, I don't know, but it didn't - didn't ...
049:34:01|C|Pet|16, you're very weak.
049:34:13|T|CMP|Mark. Subtle one, very subtle on the left eye, outboard, upper.

049:46:46|T|CDR|Mark. Flash across the bottom of the left eye, high speed.
049:49:11|T|CDR|Hey, Don. Can you tell us how we're doing on time?
049:49:15|C|Pet|Stand by one; I'll let you know.
049:49:20|C|Pet|You've got about 20 more minutes.
049:49:27|T|CDR|Okay, thank you.
049:49:35|T|LMP|Don, this thing was made for about a size 6-1/4 or something head. It's really tight on me.
049:49:48|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. We'll make a note of that.
049:49:52|T|LMP|I'm not complaining, it's just a little tight.
049:49:55|C|Pet|Roger.
049:50:34|T|LMP|Mark. Bright flash down at the right center of the right eye -
049:51:11|T|CMP|Mark. A dull fuzzy spot in the outboard center of the left eye.
049:52:05|T|CDR|Mark. Flash in the center of the right eye - sort of like a small flash.
049:52:56|T|CMP|Mark. Flash in the center of left eye, just a faint flash - much more like a dot.

049:59:38|T|CMP|Mark. Small flash in the upper right center of the -
050:00:08|T|Crew|[Garbled.]
050:00:11|T|LMP|Mark. My last mark was the upper center right eye, little flash.
050:00:21|T|LMP|Mark. Small flash in the left center of the right eye.
050:01:04|T|LMP|Mark. Mark. A - one - the first one was right eye, a streak going from inboard center to the upper right. Left one was a streak, pencil shaped - a pencil line, left eye from center to upper right.
050:02:04|T|LMP|Mark. Very subtle flash in the light - right eye, upper cen - upper right.
050:02:13|T|LMP|Mark. Another subtle one just below that, center right, right eye.
050:03:12|T|LMP|Mark. Left eye, a streak starting in the center.
050:03:16|T|LMP|Mark. Right eye, dot, center. The left eye was a streak starting in the center going out to the right. It increased in size as it went from right to left.

050:09:31|T|CMP|Mark. Flash in the right eye, right side.
050:10:57|T|LMP|Houston, 16. How's the time?
050:11:08|C|Pet|16, we figure the time is about up on the ALFMED experiment. We'd like to know if the motor is stopped.
050:11:19|T|CMP|No, it's still running.
050:11:20|T|LMP|Mark. A streak in the lower left side of the left eye, moving down.
050:11:28|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. Keep going until the motor stops.
050:11:35|T|CMP|Okay.
050:11:37|T|LMP|Mark. Thin white dot upper right, inboard, left eye.
050:13:18|T|LMP|Mark. Lightning-flash-type phenomena, lower right, inboard, left eye.

050:15:22|T|LMP|Mark. White dot, left eye, outboard, center.
050:15:29|T|CMP|Mark. White dot, left eye, center.
050:15:41|T|LMP|Mark. Right eye, center, inboard, a white dot.
050:15:48|C|Pet|Okay, Ken, we've got all the ALFMED data we need. We want you to give us a mark when you shut the motor off.
050:16:08|T|CMP|Okay, Pete.
050:16:10|T|CMP|Mark. ALFMED is off.
050:16:14|C|Pet|Roger.
050:18:37|C|Pet|16, Houston. Whenever you can copy, I've got some words on the IMU problem that we had. Also some - an entry to the G&amp;C Checklist.
050:18:47|T|CMP|Okay, Don. How about standing by, would you? Stand by until we clean up all the ...
050:18:54|C|Pet|Roger.
050:18:58|T|CMP|You're cutting out pretty bad, Don.
050:19:03|C|Pet|Okay.
050:28:05|C|Pet|16, the PI advises on the ALFMED experiment that we got about 70 counts, and he's very happy with the results, and he wants you to verify that the clutch is in the Stow position.
050:28:19|T|CMP|That's a verify.
050:28:23|C|Pet|Roger; thank you.
050:28:24|T|LMP|Okay, great. Those things - those things are really something, Don. There were a couple of the phenomena that I had seen previously that I didn't see today, but there were some other ones today that were different too. The phenomena - the flashes leave no afterglow and they're - they're just instantaneous. All the colors are white - were all we saw. We saw no colors at all; neither John nor I. It was - every one we saw was white.
050:28:55|C|Pet|Roger, copy that.
050:32:16|T|CMP|Okay, Don. I'm ready to copy some things now.
050:32:22|C|Pet|Say again, Ken.
050:32:23|T|CMP|Before we get into copying stuff, let me confirm what Charlie said about that clutch. Now I listened to that thing retract before, and as soon as we went to the mid-position on the clutch - why, you can hear the plates come down. And we went ahead and rapped it once, anyhow, just to be sure, but I didn't hear anything jiggle. And we cycled it to Operate and then back to Stow, and it all felt normal and the - the plate travel sounded proper.
050:32:56|C|Pet|Okay, we copied that, Ken.
050:33:00|T|CMP|Okay, and I guess my only comment on ALFMED is that I think those light flashes are made by the same guy that makes the emperor's clothes.
050:33:08|C|Pet|That makes what?
050:33:13|T|CMP|I think they're made by the same guy that makes the emperor's clothes.
050:33:17|C|Pet|Roger; understand.
050:34:19|T|CMP|Hey, Don, I'm standing by to copy - the words you got about P52s and G&amp;N and any of those other subjects pertaining to our operation.
050:34:28|C|Pet|Okay, Ken, I'll - we'll talk about the platform problem first, and I'm gonna back up and talk about the original data that we passed up because there are some small corrections to that. And then I'll - I'll try to break it down into about four shovel-fulls here for you, because it's a fairly big mouthful if we try to do it all at once.
050:34:50|T|CMP|Okay. You have some stuff that I probably should copy, huh?
050:34:54|C|Pet|Yes, I will have some items for you to copy.
050:35:01|C|Pet|Hold off a minute, 16. We're coming up on an omni switch.
050:35:10|T|CMP|Roger.
050:36:53|C|Pet|Okay, 16. How do you read now?
050:36:58|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
050:37:00|C|Pet|Okay, we'll start here on this thing. First of all, the - the problem occurs, apparently, in CSM-117 when the TVC relay changes state, either going from enable to disable or from disable to enable. And it causes an electric glitch that makes the CDUs go to 90 degrees; in particular, the yaw CDU, and therefore the CMC thinks it's in gimbal lock and goes into a coarse align mode. The - some of the cases that could cause this, for example, are when you go to - when you select Manual Optics, you have the TVC relay enabled and then if you go from Manual to Auto, or if you hit the Zero Optics switch with Manual Optics selected, or if you go from P52 to P00 with the Manual Optics selected, you will reset the TVC relay, and that can cause the glitch. This is apparently what happened last night.
050:38:15|T|CMP|Okay, is it important for me to copy those things that cause this, or are you going to give me a way to prevent it?
050:38:21|C|Pet|Negative. You don't have to copy those. That's just background. Now we're going to talk about what you can do here in P52s and maybe subsequently in - for the LOIs and for P40s. There are two ways to approach the P52. There's a - there's a quick and dirty way which is to simply go to SCS Control, because with SCS control, the TVC relay is not enabled. And, by doing that, you don't run the risk of generating this glitch. That's not the way, however, that the guys are recommending, because they have a procedure that they think will handle not only the P52, but the burn cases. And they'd like you to get that procedure, and you're going to have to copy that one.
050:39:11|T|CMP|Okay. How about running down that list of things that causes the TVC enable to change state again? Let me - let me copy those this time.
050:39:23|C|Pet|Okay, will do. And - now - these cases are not all inclusive. These are just some examples that - that we can bring up to you. First of all, the TVC relay is enabled when you select Manual Optics. It is then subsequently disabled if you go from Manual to Auto or if you go to zero the Optics with Manual selected, or if you go with Manual - with the Manual Optics selected, if you go from P52 to P00. But these are probably not the only cases; they're probably just some examples that we know of.
050:40:11|T|CMP|Okay.
050:40:12|C|Pet|Another important point, Ken, is that it changes state during the TVC gimbal drive check.
050:40:22|T|CMP|Yes, that's what I was afraid of. Okay.
050:40:24|C|Pet|Okay. We're going to - this next procedure that I have to read up to you is probably going to be the one that we'll use to try to get around that. And also, we'd like you to use it in the P52s because it allows us to monitor for the glitch, and at the same time prevents the glitch from bringing your platform down.
050:40:44|T|CMP|Okay.
050:40:47|C|Pet|Okay, if you're ready to copy -
050:40:48|T|CMP|... -
050:40:49|C|Pet|- I'll read you up the procedures.
050:40:51|T|CMP|- ... copy this or - Okay, I'll just copy this on a scratch pad, and we'll put it in the appropriate place, if that sounds reasonable.
050:40:57|C|Pet|Roger. That sounds real good. Number 1, we want you to key Verb 48 Enter and load Noun 46, Register 1. The first digit should be loaded as a 3. The rest of the numbers can be left as they are.
050:41:25|T|CMP|Okay, why don't you read on at about that pace, Don, and I'll just copy, and then I'll read it back to you?
050:41:31|C|Pet|Okay, the second step is key Verb 25 Noun 07 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, 1 Enter. That sets the Average g flag, but does not turn Average g on. The combination of those two will prevent the CMC from going into coarse align. After you've done that, you can select P52 and use your normal alignment procedures And, when you've completed the P52 to terminate this - EMP, we'll have you key Verb 48 Enter, load Noun 4 Register 1 with its original value, whether that was 2 or 1 in the first digit. Step 2, we'll have you a key Verb 25 Noun 07 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, Enter. That will then return your - you to the correct DAP and also reset the average g flag.
050:43:18|T|CMP|Okay, that - that was, in Verb 25 Noun 07, that was a 75 Enter, 1 Enter, and then zero Enter or a 1 Enter?
050:43:26|C|Pet|Zero Enter.
050:43:30|T|CMP|Okay.
050:43:32|C|Pet|Okay, that's the whole procedure.
050:43:37|T|CMP|Okay, let me look it over here for a second. At first glance, the first thing I see here looks like - do I - should I ...?
050:43:58|C|Pet|16, we're switching omnis; hold off a minute.
050:45:50|C|Pet|Okay, 16. How do you read now?
050:45:55|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
050:45:56|C|Pet|Okay. We lost comm there temporarily. You can go ahead now with the readback on that any time you're ready.
050:46:05|T|CMP|Okay. Did you get my questions about the Verb 46?
050:46:09|C|Pet|Negative, but we have a caution note that says, "Do not key Verb 46 Enter while this EMP is in to prevent Sap - Saturn DAP actually coming on.
050:46:20|C|Pet|Okay, thank you.
050:46:34|T|CMP|Okay, what you would do then is - we're gonna set Saturn DAP in Average g in order to prevent coarse aligning in the event middle gimbal picks up spurious signals. And to do this, we set Verb 48 with a Noun 46. Digit A is set to a 3, and we set the Average g flag with a Verb 25 Noun 07, address 75, bit 1, set it to the 1. Then we should call P52 normally, and if the glitch occurs, it'll be ignored. I assume from this if the glitch occurs some time while we're in the process of taking marks, that we get some kind of garbage out of P52, but it should be obvious. And from what you gave me on this list up at the top, it looks like normally we would not run across TVC Enable during that period. At the completion of a 52, we go back into a Verb 48, and now we take Noun 46 back to its original values. Then we reset the Average g flag by taking channel 75 bit 1 to a zero, using Verb 25 Noun 07, and the restrictions on this EMP is that we will not use Verb 46 at any time while this is punched in.
050:48:04|C|Pet|That's affirmative, Ken.
050:48:12|T|CMP|Okay, do you have some words on how - on how we handle the P40?
050:48:30|C|Pet|Okay, Ken, and - in the P40 is what we're thinking about and we haven't completely decided now is we probably use this EMP before and after the TVC gimbal check, and we may move the TVC gimbal check earlier or before the burn so that we have plenty of time to get this thing in and out.
050:48:56|T|CMP|Okay, that sounds like a good plan.
050:49:00|C|Pet|Okay, now I've got the last shovel-full here if you're ready to copy.
050:49:06|T|CMP|Okay, I've got my bucket out.
050:49:08|C|Pet|Okay, if you should lose the platform alignment, we'll do the same thing we tried last night, a Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter, Enter, Verb 40 Enter, and then go to the checklist, G/7-1, and do the rapid IMU realign.
050:49:44|T|CMP|Okay, Don. If we tumble the thing again, we're going to release the platform by setting Noun 20 to - to zeros, and we do that with the Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter, Enter. Then we release the platform with the Verb 40 Enter, and then we go through page G/7-1 and get a rapid alignment to the GDC. Now that - that assumes that what happened to us was the glitch in the middle gimbal. If I understood your conversation, it's possible to have a glitch in one of the other gimbals. Is that correct?
050:50:23|C|Pet|That's correct. That will not, however, get you into the - into the problem that causes the platform to go into coarse align. And also, we were advised that while this EMP is in, you shouldn't have the problem with losing the platform alignment.
050:50:41|T|CMP|Okay. If we - if we get this glitch in one of the other axes - I - and we have the controls enabled, I assume one of the things we would - we'd see would be some unusual thruster activity.
050:50:58|C|Pet|That's affirmative, and in that case I guess all you need -
050:51:00|T|CMP|... proper correction. Well, I'm trying to figure out what we'd do if we have a - say we're in attitude hold. If we have that glitch occur right now and - with our engines disabled, I don't think there would be any way I'd see it until I went to use some auto optics or something. And that - if we were in an attitude hold, it appears to me that I would see a - a DAP that appeared to be unstable in the axis that it was going for, or at least it would take off for some place other than where it is. And we would go to SCS momentarily, and the proper response would be a Verb 40, Enter, and allow the CMC to zero and recount the IMU CDUs. Is that correct?
050:51:50|C|Pet|Right on.
050:52:00|T|CMP|This TVC enable that we're talking about that's used for the gimbal drive test - now that's a function only of the gimbal drive test and not a function of the setting of the trims in P40. Is that correct?
050:52:15|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
050:52:20|T|CMP|Okay, so, our P40 then would be something like we would go out and we'll get a gimbal drive check to you folks early, then we'll turn the gimbals back off probably, and I'm just - what I'm ...
050:52:35|C|Pet|Omni switch coming up, 16. Stand by. Stand by, 16; we're switching omnis.
050:52:46|T|CMP|Roger.
050:54:19|C|Pet|16, how do you read now?
050:54:23|T|CMP|Loud and clear, Don.
050:54:24|C|Pet|Okay. Go ahead with your question.
050:54:25|T|CMP|I'm trying to give you my impression of what we're gonna be - the general approach to the burn - and we check out the gimbal drives and the gimbal trims and then, when we come into P40 for the actual burn, we would go ahead and use the SCS gimbal checks to verify all the gimbals are properly hooked up. Then we would bypass the flashing 202 with an Enter, and we'd just let the gimbals go to trim, and everything else would be done nominally.
050:55:07|C|Pet|Ken, I think your general impression is right. I guess we're not yet ready to commit ourselves to a - a set of procedures. We're going to have Stu take a look at it in the simulator here, and we'll come up to you later with some detailed procedures specifically for the burn.
050:55:27|T|CMP|Roger. I understand that; I just wanted to make sure I had a general understanding in case we had to do some original thinking.
050:55:35|C|Pet|Roger. I think we concur with what you said so far.
050:55:51|T|CMP|Okay. And the other thing, that out of curiosity - if the guys in the back room, after they get through getting all the important things squared away, that they could kind of think some more about their list of things that causes this enable relay to change state. I'll compile a list of those things in case we come across something later on that we hadn't thought about.
050:56:16|C|Pet|Okay, Ken, we'll do that for you. And there's one last note here, that, prior to your P52s, it'd be a good idea to align the GDC just prior to going in .
050:56:30|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I don't think I'll let that guy get very far away from us.
050:56:33|C|Pet|Roger.
050:56:54|C|Pet|And, Ken, I've got an update to the G&amp;C Checklist on page 9-4 any time you're ready to copy.
050:57:09|T|CMP|Okay, pencil in hand.
050:57:13|C|Pet|Okay, on Page 9-4 line 07, column A -
050:57:20|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
050:57:21|C|Pet|Column A, line 07, should read "76747." Line 11 should read "77552." Line 12, "77756"; line 13, "77307.
050:58:05|T|CMP|Okay, I 'm on page G/9-4, reading down column A. On line 7, I replace "77426" with "76747." On line 11, I replace "00214" with "77552." On line 12, I replace "77714" with 77756." Line 13, I replace "77446" with "77307.
050:58:49|C|Pet|That's correct, Ken.
050:59:10|C|Pet|And we've got, Ken, here some notes on this jet-on monitor EMP. We'd like to do a check on it at 54:25, and I can read you up the procedure for that any time you're ready to copy.
050:59:24|T|CMP|Go ahead.
050:59:27|C|Pet|Okay, at 54:25 in the Flight Plan, we would like to add "P20 option 5," in the "LM checkout attitude'', Noun 78, minus 09000, minus 03000, plus 25500; Noun 79, plus 00050; Noun 70, plus 00047. We will up link the jet-on monitor loads and, when the P20 maneuver is complete, you can do a Verb 74 Enter. And the P20 attitude that we've selected will be the attitude that you're already in, so there is actually not a maneuver involved here.
051:00:49|T|CMP|Okay, when you say when maneuver complete, - does that mean that you would want us to maneuver to the LM checkout attitude using P20, or are you going to let us go to Verb 49 for that? And then, I'll call it up and bypass the maneuver, is that correct?
051:01:06|C|Pet|You can use a Verb 49 for that, Ken.
051:01:11|T|CMP|Okay, I understand. A Verb 49, and then we'll call P20, and then you can command the same attitude I'm in.
051:01:17|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
051:01:18|T|CMP|In other words, I've got the 50:18 the second time. Then you want the Verb 74, Enter.
051:01:24|C|Pet|That's affirmative. Coming up on an omni switch, 16. Stand by.
051:03:24|C|Pet|16, how do you read now?
051:03:29|T|CMP|Loud and clear, Don.
051:03:31|C|Pet|Okay, the only other thing is at 56 hours, that's 56:00, we want you to terminate the jet-on monitor EMP.
051:03:53|T|CMP|Okay, can you tell me what dead band you are gonna be setting in there?
051:04:35|C|Pet|Okay, Ken, it'll be a one-degree dead band.
051:04:49|T|CMP|Okay, you're setting me in the EMP at one-degree dead band; is that affirm?
051:04:55|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
051:05:15|C|Pet|Ken, on the Noun 70, I read you a - a plus 00047. You actually don't need that plus; that's an octal number.
051:05:25|T|CMP|Roger. I understand.
051:05:29|T|CMP|Okay, it's not clear to me - if we are going to exceed this or not; we normally would not. Do you want to try letting us drift out of the dead band and see if the monitor works?
051:05:55|C|Pet|Negative; that's - that's not the intent, I think. They just want to get the program in and look at it.
051:06:03|T|CMP|Okay. Well, sometime before we get through, would you ask them if they would object to letting us see if that thing triggers the same response that we're used to?
051:06:16|C|Pet|Okay, Ken; we'd like to think that over. We'll get back to you on that.
051:06:21|T|CMP|Okay, fine. Thank you.
051:06:23|C|Pet|Okay. Now I've still got this note that we've had since about 24 hours ago on changing the angle on that Sun wheel and if you have that out now, we can clear that up otherwise, I'll hold it a while.
051:06:37|T|CMP|I don't have it out, but why don't you tell me what it is. I think I know what you're talking about. It's due to the REFSMMAT angles on there being changed.
051:06:44|C|Pet|That's affirmative. And we (belch) inked "27 degrees" on it. We should have written in "37 degrees".
051:06:59|T|CMP|Okay. It turns out we're at - is inked in at 27 and it should be 37.
051:07:06|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
051:07:11|T|CMP|Okay, thank you. I'm glad you remembered that.
051:07:14|C|Pet|Roger.
051:10:12|C|Pet|16, terminate battery Bravo charge.
051:10:17|T|CDR|Okay. Okay, it's in work.
051:10:24|C|Pet|Roger.
051:10:42|T|CDR|What's the probability of this - glitch happening? Is it about one in a million?
051:10:47|C|Pet|Stand by 1
051:10:59|T|CDR|Say again, Pete. You cut out.
051:11:01|C|Pet|16, I guess we really don't know the answer to that. That's one of the reasons we want to get this EMP in to kind of watch for it and see if it's occurring frequently or infrequently. Omni switch, 16.
051:11:53|T|CDR|Okay, Don, we're going to go ahead and punch through this P52 and we'll start with our little procedure here, and you might kind of watch us through and make sure we do it right the first time.
051:12:05|C|Pet|Will do.
051:13:23|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. You're watching this, right?
051:13:25|C|Pet|That's affirmative. We're watching and you can go ahead.
051:13:30|T|CDR|Okay, and what did you say the probability was of this thing happening?
051:13:34|C|Pet|I think we don't know the answer to that, John. That's why we want to load this software program so we can monitor to see if that glitch is occurring frequently - or it may never occur again, we really don't know.
051:13:48|T|CDR|Understand.
051:13:51|T|CMP|Okay, I've got it in. I'm going to call P52.
051:13:55|C|Pet|Roger.
051:14:15|C|Pet|Can you get the GDC aligned up?
051:14:20|T|CMP|Oh, yeah.
051:14:21|T|CDR|You better believe it.
051:17:23|T|CMP|Houston, how do you like those angles?
051:17:30|C|Pet|Stand by one.
051:17:36|C|Pet|Look real good, 16.
051:17:41|T|CMP|Do you want us to torque some that small?
051:17:50|C|Pet|Go ahead and torque them.
051:17:53|T|CMP|Okay. We'll do it at 17 minutes. Yeah, I guess that's 51:18, excuse me.
051:18:07|C|Pet|Understand 18 minutes.
051:18:12|T|CMP|Okay, would you like for me to return it to zero with the switch in Manual this time, just to see if you get that glitch?
051:18:22|C|Pet|Affirmative.
051:18:34|T|CDR|Going to zero.
051:18:36|T|CDR|Mark.
051:18:59|C|Pet|And, 16, we didn't see any glitch. There, we're coming up on an omni switch.
051:22:19|C|Pet|And, 16, that EMP that we loaded to protect the platform - we'll refer to it as EMP 509.
051:22:34|T|CDR|Okay, 509; sounds familiar.
051:22:37|C|Pet|Roger.
051:30:32|C|Pet|16, if you'll go Accept, we've got an up-link for you. And I've got news, if you're interested.
051:30:43|T|CDR|Okay, here's P00 and Accept. And, yeah, we're interested.
051:30:48|C|Pet|Okay. Former President Lyndon Johnson is resting comfortably after he was hospitalized again following an increase in his heart rate. He's hospitalized in San Antonio. Vice President Agnew, speaking here in Houston, has asked the nation's supermarket executives to hold the line on prices. If prices for food continue to soar, Mr. Agnew hinted at mandatory Federal controls. President Nixon added a stop during his scheduled trip to Moscow. Prior to returning home, he will stop off in Poland to discuss Polish-American relations. The Moscow trip in late May is still on, despite some fears that recent developments in the Vietnamese conflict could affect the President's visit to the Soviet Union. State news: The Texas governor's race is still a hot item, but no word yet from John Connally, who said he may speak out on the wide-open race. Congressman Bob Eckhardt says the U.S. needs at least three large super ocean ports to keep in contention with the world market. He says the Galveston-Houston area is a prime superport site. And on sports news: The Astros captured their first victory of the year with a 7-2 win over the L.A. Giants.And some scores on the other games: in the American League, Cleveland 4, Boston 0; Baltimore 4 New York 0. In the National League, St. Louis 5, Philadelphia 4; Los Angeles 8, Atlanta 3. The Boston marathon, run yesterday on Patriots Day in Best. Town, was won by a 25-year-old engineering student from Finland. Strangely enough, they have omitted his name. A 33-year-old Long Island, New York, woman, Nina Kuscsik, won the special ladies division. The Los Angeles Lakers and the Milwaukee Bucks are tied 2-2 in their Western division playoffs in the NBA.
051:33:00|T|CDR|Charlie wants to know how (laughter) - how Consolidated Jack Pine is doing.
051:33:08|C|Pet|(Laughter) Was that Consolidated Jackpot?
051:33:13|T|CDR|Jack Pine.
051:33:14|C|Pet|Roger.
051:33:21|T|CDR|Probably lost 3 or 4 points again yesterday.
051:33:25|C|Pet|Roger. Charlie, I guess I haven't got those figures handy. We'll see what we can do.
051:33:44|T|LMP|If you can find out, Pete, you're a better man than I am. I've been trying to find it for 10 years.
051:33:50|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie, And you can have your computer back, 16.
051:34:10|T|CDR|Yeah, that compensation you guys put up there really fixed that baby.
051:34:15|C|Pet|Yeah, seems to have.
051:34:18|T|LMP|Plus Ken's marks.
051:37:42|T|CMP|Don, we're gonna put off the Skylab ... until our ... and take the time to do it right. And we're gonna - gonna mix up ... snacks and try to get back ...
051:37:57|C|Pet|We've got an omni switch, 16. Stand by.
051:38:11|T|CMP|Houston, do you read Casper?
051:38:24|C|Pet|You're pretty weak.
051:38:38|C|Pet|16, can you read now?
051:38:41|T|CMP|Yeah, I read you now. Did you copy when I commented about the Skylab food?
051:38:45|C|Pet|Negative.
051:38:55|T|LMP|Pete, I'm back on the Biomed. How does it look?
051:38:58|C|Pet|Stand by one.
051:39:34|C|Pet|Charlie, they're just now starting to get it. They'll take a look at; I'll let you know in a minute.
051:39:42|T|LMP|Okay, thanks.
051:39:49|C|Pet|Okay, you want to go ahead with your comments on the Skylab food, now?
051:40:10|T|CMP|The comment I made, Don, was that, because we're behind the time line here, we - we thought we would put the Skylab food off until tonight, so we have time to do it right. And we're just going to eat snacks for now and try to get caught up a little bit.
051:40:16|C|Pet|Okay; we concur with that, Ken.
051:40:21|T|CMP|Roger.
051:43:15|C|Pet|16, we'd like to get the High Gain up on this next rev. You're about ten minutes away from it now. Do you think you can make that? If not, we can wait another rev.
051:43:25|T|LMP|We'll get it to you.
051:43:27|C|Pet|Okay, it's Pitch, minus 40; and Yaw, plus 90, 90.
051:44:12|C|Pet|And, Ken, you can go on; your - in your checklist there down to the MSFN cue any time, you're ready.
051:45:00|T|LMP|Houston. 16. Over.
051:45:03|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
051:45:06|T|LMP|Okay, Pete, I hit a Command Reset there. I went to the - went to High Gain too soon; and we're operating now in Omni Bravo. And give me a Mark. The High Gain just didn't seem to work; it looks like I ought to be able to get High Gain now. I'll try it.
051:45:25|C|Pet|Negative. You won't be able to get it yet.
051:45:31|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, you're on Omni Charlie now.
051:45:47|C|Pet|16, we'll handle the omnis until we're ready to go to the High Gain, and we'll tell you when to go to High Gain at the angles we just gave you.
051:45:59|T|LMP|Okay, we're all set, and you're on Omni Charlie. Will you want me to reconfigure?
051:46:06|C|Pet|Come back to Bravo.
051:46:10|T|LMP|Okay, back to - back to Bravo. Okay, you're in Omni Bravo.
051:46:21|C|Pet|Okay. Thank you, Charlie.
051:47:30|C|Pet|16, would you go ahead and start the Pan Camera and Mapping Camera film cycling procedures down to the point in the checklist where it calls - where it calls for a MSFN cue?
051:52:57|T|LMP|Houston, how much longer until we get the High Gain?
051:53:08|C|Pet|A couple of minutes, Charlie.
051:53:13|T|LMP|Okay.
051:55:04|C|Pet|Okay, 16, you can bring up the High Gain.
051:56:13|C|Pet|16, bring up the High Gain now, please.
051:56:26|T|LMP|Okay, there you go. You got Reacq and Narrow on the High Gain.
051:56:34|C|Pet|Roger.
051:57:13|C|Pet|16, we're ready to proceed with the film cycling.
051:57:20|T|LMP|Okay.
051:57:53|T|LMP|That's verified.
051:57:55|T|CMP|Mapping Camera Image Motion is Off.
051:57:59|T|LMP|That's verified.
051:58:02|T|CMP|That darn ... Data System is On. PCM Bit Rate, High?
051:58:11|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
051:58:12|T|CMP|System - S-Band Aux TV to SCI?
051:58:17|T|LMP|Go ahead.
051:58:19|T|CMP|SM/AC Power is coming On.
051:58:34|T|CMP|Okay, the Mapping Camera is coming on to Standby.
051:58:38|C|Pet|Roger.
051:59:08|T|CMP|Okay, you ready for Mapping Camera and Pan Camera operations ?
051:59:14|C|Pet|Stand by one.
051:59:17|T|LMP|And that one.
051:59:33|C|Pet|16, stand by. We're checking a couple of temperatures.
051:59:35|T|CMP|Man, that peanut butter -
051:59:36|C|Pet|...
051:59:43|T|CMP|- peanut butter was really good.
051:59:44|C|Pet|Okay, proceed, 16.
051:59:47|T|CMP|Okay. The Mapping Camera is coming On. And the Pan Camera Self Test has been hit .
051:59:47|T|CMP|Okay. Mapping Camera is coming On.
051:59:51|T|CDR|I just might eat the peanut butter with no bread. How would that be?
051:59:57|T|LMP|Borrow some.
052:00:00|T|CDR|Can't find the bread.
052:00:06|T|LMP|Got to.
052:00:07|T|CDR|Yeah, I know it.
052:00:09|T|CMP|And the Pan Camera Self Test is completed..
052:00:20|T|LMP|Well, I - I saw the ... around here - this morning.
052:00:38|T|CDR|... you say is true -
052:00:39|T|LMP|... peaches are delicious.
052:00:40|T|CDR|Oh, that -
052:00:42|T|CMP|Charlie?
052:00:43|T|LMP|Yeah. They're good. Want a bite?
052:00:52|T|CMP|No, thanks.
052:00:53|T|LMP|Want a bite, John?
052:00:54|T|CDR|No, I just had some peaches. I had to throw mine in the jett bag ...
052:01:04|T|LMP|What are you waiting for, a word from them?
052:01:05|T|CMP|No. Waiting for the time to run out.
052:01:10|T|CMP|Okay, the Pan Camera Mode barber pole has gone back to gray. That took about 40 seconds.
052:01:15|C|Pet|Roger.
052:01:27|T|CDR|Now I lost my peanut butter ... I lose some of my peanut butter.
052:01:38|T|CMP|I was only kidding. If you find it floating around, I bet you'll have a hard time finding the guy who hid it.
052:01:49|T|LMP|It's really good. Peaches is one of the best things we have.
052:01:53|T|CDR|... good.
052:01:54|T|CMP|Mapping Camera is to Off.
052:01:58|T|LMP|How did you cycle the film?
052:02:00|T|CDR|I didn't.
052:02:01|T|LMP|Huh?
052:02:02|T|CDR|Ken did it.
052:02:26|T|CMP|The - was there something you wanted to say at the end of this thing, Charlie?
052:02:29|T|LMP|Huh? No. I just wanted to be sure at the end of this thing that the Mapping Camera to Standby Mode -
052:02:33|T|CMP|Huh? Oh -
052:02:34|T|LMP|- on Page 1-16 -
052:02:35|T|CMP|Oh, okay. While ... -
052:02:36|T|LMP|That's after - after you've cycled the Pan Camera switch.
052:02:40|T|CMP|Yeah. Well, let me see the Flight Plan. Thank you.
052:02:44|T|LMP|I ...
052:03:02|T|CMP|Houston, do you copy Casper?
052:03:04|T|CDR|I've just been contemplating ... -
052:03:04|C|Pet|Read you loud and clear, Casper, Go ahead.
052:03:07|T|CMP|Okay.
052:03:08|T|CDR|- get to ...
052:03:08|T|CMP|Okay. The next item here is to take the Mapping Camera to Standby mode, and I assume I should do that before I turn the SM/AC Power Off.
052:03:21|C|Pet|That's affirmative, 16.
052:03:28|T|LMP|Can they see that down there? -
052:03:34|T|CMP|Yeah. Well, ... they can tell it, too.
052:03:42|T|LMP|... cycle.
052:03:44|T|CMP|Could it take the cassette? Will it sit one place and still - corners it has to go around and ... cassette?
052:03:52|T|LMP|You could have, yeah.
052:03:53|T|CMP|Probably you would -
052:03:54|T|LMP|Wait, yeah.
052:04:00|T|CDR|Oh-ho.
052:03:58|C|Pet|Alright, Casper, after you turn the Mapping Camera to the Standby mode, we want you to add Pan Camera Self Test to Heaters.
052:04:11|T|CMP|Okay, you've got Heaters now. And we're in Standby, and I'm about to turn the SM/AC Power Off unless you want me to hold it.
052:04:18|C|Pet|Leave it on, Casper. Leave that Power on.
052:04:24|T|CMP|Okay.
052:04:30|T|LMP|... he say ... Standby Mode that I leave it? ...
052:04:31|T|CDR|..., yeah.
052:04:32|T|LMP|Uh-huh.
052:04:34|T|CMP|Well, ...
052:04:38|T|LMP|I doubt it.
052:04:39|T|CDR|Number 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, a 6, ... all be ...
052:04:52|T|LMP|John, I tell you what I'll do ...
052:04:59|C|Pet|16, go Omni Bravo. You can stow the High Gain.
052:05:00|T|CDR|I'll ...
052:05:01|T|LMP|Wait a minute.
052:06:25|T|CMP|Houston, Casper.
052:06:27|C|Pet|Go ahead, Casper.
052:06:32|T|CMP|Okay, after the film cycling, it normally calls for our taking the SM/AC Power Off, and you asked that we hold there. Do you want us to complete the rest of that powerdown, or do you want to just stop there and you're going to pick it up later or - what would you have in mind?
052:06:49|C|Pet|We want to leave the Heaters on for a while and the Power on. And we'll pick it up again later at about 58 hours, but we'll call you.
052:07:00|T|CMP|Okay. We'll leave that in your care.
052:07:03|C|Pet|Roger.
052:08:21|T|CMP|And, if you're ready, Houston, we'll go ahead and stop PTC and go over to the UV attitude.
052:08:30|C|Pet|Okay.
052:08:45|T|CMP|It's really a shame to kill a PTC that looks as nice as this one.
052:08:49|C|Pet|Yeah, it does.
052:09:38|C|Pet|Casper, you might try killing this roll at 208, which is your next roll attitude.
052:09:49|T|CMP|We' re with you.
052:09:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; 52 hours, 17 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now being maneuvered into a High Gain Antenna attitude leaving the Passive Thermal Control after all night and most of the day. Midcourse correction 3 will not be performed and it's likely that Midcourse 4 will not be either.

052:26:19|T|CMP|Hey, Don.
052:26:20|C|Pet|Go ahead, Ken.
052:26:25|T|CMP|Let me tell you, all our plans for peanut butter were - were correct. That's the ideal space food.
052:26:33|C|Pet|Roger. You guys gonna do the Skylab thing tonight?
052:27:39|C|Pet|16, Houston. How do you read?
052:27:44|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
052:27:45|T|CDR|Loud and clear.
052:27:46|C|Pet|Okay, we're just doing a subcarrier voice check.
052:27:57|T|CDR|Your sub - your subcarrier has good voice -
052:28:00|C|Pet|Right.
052:28:01|T|CDR|- and Ken's right about that peanut butter sandwich. It's like when we were aboard ship. We can get that peanut butter sandwich when we're in too much of a hurry to do something else - to do anything else, and it works!
052:28:15|C|Pet|Okay. We'll pass that along.
052:29:33|C|Pet|Casper, I've got that list of TVC relay set and reset conditions any time you're ready to copy.
052:29:50|T|CDR|I'm all pencil.
052:29:55|C|Pet|Okay, the conditions that set the relay are: one, Spacecraft Control switch, CMC; Optics Zero switch, Off; and Optics Mode switch, Manual.
052:30:24|T|CDR|What to Manual?
052:30:25|C|Pet|Optics Mode switches Manual. And number two, another way to set it, is start a CMC TVC gimbal drive check in P20. Okay, the different ways that it can get reset are: number one, Optics Zero switch, Zero; number two, Optics Zero switch, Off and the Optics Mode switch to CMC; number three, Spacecraft Control -
052:31:38|T|CDR|Hey, Don, would you stand by for a minute, please?
052:31:40|C|Pet|Sure will.
052:31:41|T|CDR|Let's get our UV. Give us a rough on that time and I'll come back with you.
050:31:45|C|Pet|Roger.
052:37:51|T|CDR|Houston, 16.
052:37:53|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
052:37:56|T|CDR|Okay. On your plat board, Pete, what do you show over now?
052:38:02|C|Pet|Just about over Florida. Kind of down over the tip of -
052:38:10|T|CDR|Okay.
052:41:04|C|Pet|16, could you verify the position of the S-Band Aux TV switch?
052:41:12|T|CDR|Yeah, it's still in SCI, waiting for you guys to tell us to finish up our film cycling checklist.
052:41:19|C|Pet|Understand; it's in SCI?
052:41:23|T|CMP|Affirmative.
052:41:31|C|Pet|You can take that switch to Off, but leave the Pan Camera Heaters and stuff on.
052:41:38|T|CMP|Okay. Well, since we - you don't want us to do the exact checklist, we'll - we'll turn the SCI off and the Data System Off, or do you want the Data System On? You're not reading anything now, I don't think.
052:41:56|C|Pet|Just leave the Data System On. We've commanded it Off on the ground.
052:42:03|T|CMP|Okay; Data System On.
052:42:07|C|Pet|Okay.
052:42:57|T|LMP|Houston, with the binocs out looking at the Earth, we can see Florida and the - the real blue water around the Bahamas. On around the Gulf of Mexico, looks like you might have some clouds near Houston and on down in New Mexico and the Great Lakes up in the North, where there's lots of clouds on up north of that.
052:43:20|C|Pet|Roger. It is overcast here, Charlie.
052:43:22|T|LMP|... and up in the polar icecap, there is a big broken line; it looks like a river or something running down off to the southwest. Wonder what that feature might be?
052:43:43|C|Pet|Does it look like - Is it a feature on the ground or a feature in the clouds?
052:43:55|T|LMP|I - I thought the whole thing was just snow and ice up there; maybe it is the clouds up in - it looked like to me it's - it's just up at the North Pole in the icecap area.
052:44:08|C|Pet|Roger; understand. I don't -
052:44:10|T|LMP|And it's been there since we laun - it's been there ever since we launched.
052:44:15|C|Pet|Roger.
052:44:17|T|LMP|What it appeared to me to be was some places thawed out up there, but - and I was looking at water, but that might be the clouds actually.
052:44:26|C|Pet|Okay. Tony is sitting here. I'll see if he knows anything about it.
052:44:36|T|LMP|Okay, and that storm system that was out west of Alaska or thereabouts appears to be still there.
052:44:47|C|Pet|Okay.
052:45:06|T|CMP|Okay, Don. I'm ready to copy the rest of those things that we sent, the TVC and the ...
052:45:12|C|Pet|Okay, stand by just a minute. They're adding a couple of notes to it.
052:45:16|T|CMP|Sure thing. Can I read back the - when I read back the ones that said it?
052:45:27|C|Pet|Say again, Ken.
052:45:32|T|CMP|I'll just wait until you get it all; I was going to read back the one that sent it. Everybody's talking about those binoculars. We pulled those things out in Earth orbit as we were going over the States, and it's pretty impressive. It works out well in other places; it really does enhance things you can see.
052:45:53|C|Pet|Roger. Okay, I've got this list on the TVC Relay set/reset conditions again, if you want to go back into that now.
052:46:03|T|CMP|Okay, all set.
052:46:04|C|Pet|Okay. The note they added was back up on the very first thing I gave you: the number 1, conditions to set the relay. Those conditions only work in certain programs or extended verbs, and those are P20, 22, 23, 24, 52, or Verb 41 Noun 91.
052:46:38|T|CMP|Okay.
052:46:39|C|Pet|Okay, and I believe we'd gotten down through numbers - -
052:46:41|T|CMP|Is it all options to P20?
052:46:52|C|Pet|Stand by a minute, Ken; we'll get you an answer on that.
052:46:58|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
052:47:00|C|Pet|Okay. While we're waiting for them to decide whether it's all options or not, I believe we got down through number 2, reset conditions.
052:47:11|T|CMP|Okay. I copied the Optics to Zero and the Optics Zero to Off when in CMC Mode control.
052:47:21|C|Pet|Okay, and that was number 2. Number 3 is Spacecraft Control switch, SCS. Number 4 is THC, clockwise. Number 5 is Verb 37 Enter, XX Enter. Number 6 is fresh start, Verb 36. Number 7 is Verb 34 or PRO; in the sighting mark routine, R53 display. Number 8 is Auto Enter RCS DAP at SPS cut-off plus 2.5 seconds in P40.
052:48:46|T|CMP|Okay. I didn't understand that one, Don.
052:48:49|C|Pet|Okay. It's the - it's what happens to you immediately following the burns. The SPS cuts off, and then 2.5 seconds later in P40, the TV relay gets reset.
052:49:16|T|CMP|Okay.
052:49:18|C|Pet|Okay, and on the question of options, back up under set condition number 1, it's all options except number 2 in program 20.
052:49:36|T|CMP|Okay.
052:49:39|C|Pet|And that's all of them.
052:49:44|T|CMP|Okay, and I understand that this - this can happen when you either set or reset the enable relay, is that correct?
052:49:52|C|Pet|That's affirmative. They say it can happen going - any change of state on the TVC relay.
052:50:06|T|CMP|Okay. Can you tell me if it's the change of state of the relay, or just the command to change? For instance, if we already had it in some of these things like a Verb 37, any program resets it; but if it's already in the reset position, is that a condition that's likely to trigger one of these things, or is that one of the safe conditions?
052:50:34|C|Pet|We - we think, Ken, it's the actual relay set/reset changing, not - not the command.
052:50:44|T|CMP|Okay.
052:51:20|T|CMP|Don, let me read back what you read to me, and then I'll want to mull that over for a while and see if I have any other questions.
052:51:27|C|Pet|Okay.
052:51:34|T|CMP|Okay, and I think that, except the TV enable ...
052:51:43|C|Pet|16, you're fading out.
052:51:53|C|Pet|16, we are unable to read.
052:51:56|T|CMP|Okay, the things that will set the TVC enable are the Spacecraft Control switch to CMC, the Optic Zero to Off, the Optics Mode to Manual, and the CMC TVC gimbal test in P40. These things occur only if I'm in P20 options 0, 1, 3, 4; P22, P23, P24, P52; and a Verb 41 Noun 91.
052:52:29|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. On that, the first three of those constitute one set of conditions; and the last one, that is, the start of CMC thrust vector control, is another condition that is sufficient by itself.
052:52:48|T|CMP|Okay, understand. The first three go with those programs, and the CMC thrust vector control is sufficient by itself.
052:52:57|C|Pet|Okay.
052:53:01|T|CMP|Did you - I don't remember if we concluded whether that was when it - the CMC sets the gimbal in preparation for the burn or only during that test.
052:53:12|C|Pet|I don't think that's - at least, I haven't been advised as to which set of conditions we're talking about there.
052:53:21|T|CMP|Okay, now I'll read you the reset ones.
052:53:24|C|Pet|Okay.
052:53:26|T|CMP|It's Optics to Zero, Optics Zero to Off when in CMC Mode, Spacecraft Control to SCS, translation hand controller to clockwise, and Verb 37 Enter to XX Enter, a fresh start, a Verb 34 or PRO when in the sighting mark display, and the Auto engine off or AUTO TVC reset after a burn in P40.
052:53:58|T|CMP|That's affirmative. There are eight different reset conditions; number 2 actually contains two separate items.
052:54:12|T|CMP|That's affirmative. Can you -
052:54:16|C|Pet|Okay.
052:56:11|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're starting the fuel cell purge and waste water dump.
052:56:16|C|Pet|Roger; Copy.
053:05:52|T|CDR|Houston, Casper.
053:05:54|C|Pet|Go ahead, Casper.
053:05:58|T|CDR|Okay, we've got a LM/CM Delta-P of 0.6. We'd like to go ahead and pressurize the cabin and then get ready for the LM entry.
053:06:10|C|Pet|Stand by one.
053:06:17|C|Pet|Okay, Casper. We copied, and you can go ahead.
053:06:22|T|CDR|Thank you, sir.

053:28:56|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, Ken.
053:30:58|T|LMP|Houston, 16. We're in Orion now. You've got the comm on; you should be getting high bit rate momentarily.
053:31:09|C|Eng|Okay, and we'd like to go to the High Gain.
053:31:17|T|LMP|Okay. You mean over on Casper's side? Okay.
053:32:14|T|LMP|That's signal strength for them.
053:32:22|T|CMP|Houston. Okay. We just got the signal strength on Orion.
053:32:33|C|Eng|Okay. We have LM data.
053:33:48|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, ask TELMU about this 192 package lanyard. I looked at it yesterday, and I could see red and green. It's way out and looks okay to me. Is that copacetic?
053:34:03|C|Eng|Okay. We'll find out. And, Charlie, we've got some changes to your Lunar Surface Checklist. Whenever it's convenient for you, we'll send them up to you.
053:35:01|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston.
053:35:03|T|LMP|Go ahead.
053:35:06|C|Eng|Okay. TELMU says that's okay; no problem.
053:35:16|T|LMP|That's fine, and what did you want to update? What checklist?
053:35:19|C|Eng|Okay, your Lunar Surface Checklist and your LM Cue Card for EVA prep.
053:36:02|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. I have the Cue Cards. Go ahead.
053:36:06|C|Eng|Okay. On the Cue Cards, it'll be all of them, EVA-1, -2, and -3; and I have one here for post- EVA. Okay. On the EVA-1, -2, and -3, after the sentence 'Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity to Houston,' we'd like to add the line -
053:36:38|T|LMP|Wait, wait a minute, wait; hold on.
053:36:42|C|Eng|Roger.
053:36:44|T|LMP|Okay. I've got EVA-1 prep; now which column?
053:36:56|C|Eng|Okay. It's on the left-hand column, right at the bottom line; it says "Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity to Houston.
053:37:21|T|LMP|Okay. I've got 'Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity to Houston'; the next one is a note, 'If Comm is No Go.' Is that the one you want?
053:37:27|C|Eng|Roger. We'd like to put a line in between "Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity" and the note.
053:37:34|T|LMP|Go ahead.
053:37:35|C|Eng|Okay. 'Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease.'
053:38:06|T|LMP|Okay. I got it.
053:38:09|C|Eng|Okay. And now on the EVA-2 prep Cue Card.
053:38:17|T|LMP|Go ahead.
053:38:21|C|Eng|Okay. This is the left-hand column and this is - at the bottom, and we'll add the same line there, 'Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease.'
053:39:05|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
053:39:06|C|Eng|Okay. On the EVA-3 prep, the same as EVA-2 prep.
053:39:46|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
053:39:49|C|Eng|Okay. Now this is on the post-EVA-3 Cue Card.
053:40:00|T|LMP|I got it. Go ahead.
053:40:01|C|Eng|Okay. On the third column, one-third of the way down, it says, 'Audio circuit breaker - Close.'
053:40:12|T|LMP|Okay. Got it.
053:40:14|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like to add a line right after that. "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - noise threshold, plus 1-1/2.
053:40:44|T|LMP|Okay.
053:40:45|C|Eng|Okay. The point of all of this is to increase the range of PLSS to LM, in case you're having a crew failure.
053:40:59|T|LMP|What else you got?
053:41:01|C|Eng|Okay. It's the same sort of changes to your Lunar Surface Checklist, and I'll read them to you when you're ready.
053:41:13|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We never use that checklist in this time frame. We'll copy it in, in a little bit, okay?
053:41:20|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine.
053:42:55|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
053:42:58|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
053:43:01|T|LMP|Okay. I'm a little confused about your terminology, I guess. It says "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease." We only got one VHF B to squelch.
053:43:11|C|Eng|Roger; I understand that. The "LMP" was just a cue that you're the only one on the comm at the time, so you'll be the one to - to have to listen and get it down.
053:43:24|T|LMP|Okay.
053:44:10|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston.
053:44:14|T|LMP|Go ahead.
053:44:16|C|Eng|Okay. When you get a chance there, we would like you to read the ED Voltage, both A and B.
053:44:43|T|LMP|Exactly the same thing as yesterday, 37 volts, Tony, both of them.
053:44:47|C|Eng|Okay. Good show, and verify Off.
053:44:54|T|LMP|Roger.
053:45:12|C|Eng|Okay, Apollo 16. I guess that's all they need in the Lunar Module. At your convenience, you can power down. And could you read that tunnel index as you go through, the docking index?
053:45:35|T|LMP|Strange to say, it hasn't changed any.
053:45:37|C|Eng|All right.
053:45:39|T|LMP|It's still minus three and a half.
053:45:40|C|Eng|Okay. We copy.
053:45:44|T|LMP|You going to tell me something about this Latch 10, too?
053:45:46|C|Eng|Okay.
053:45:47|T|LMP|Do you want us to do that now?
053:45:49|C|Eng|Yeah, it'd be a good time, if you're ready.
053:45:52|T|LMP|I'm sitting here looking at it.
053:45:57|C|Eng|Okay. On that docking latch Number 10, depress the yellow auxiliary release button, noting that the button will depress and whether it stays snapped in after being depressed. Now, the interest here is if the button will not depress, the latch mechanism is either stuck or broken. If the button stays snapped in, this indicates - or probably indicates that the latch was only partially cocked at launch -
053:46:24|T|LMP|... It's in -
053:46:26|C|Eng|- and stayed in.
053:46:29|T|LMP|It's in, and it stayed in.
053:46:31|C|Eng|Okay. Then, the indication there is that it was only partially cocked at launch.
053:46:40|T|LMP|Well, do you want me to re-cock it and fire it?
053:46:42|C|Eng|No, they had just as soon you leave it the way it is, because if it's broken, you may not be able to - to get it off again, and then that would foul up the undocking.
053:46:54|T|LMP|Sounds like a reasonable plan. Okay. I've got the Aux Release Button pushed in, and it stayed there, and the rest of it's gonna be left as is.
053:47:04|C|Eng|Okay. Good show. That's it.
053:49:20|T|LMP|Okay, Tony. We're going to get our suits on.
053:49:22|C|Eng|Okay.
053:55:47|T|CMP|And, Houston, we brought LM power back to the CSM at 53:49.
053:55:54|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. And Ken, we have a correction to that TVC relay set condition.
053:56:12|T|CMP|Okay.
053:56:14|C|Eng|Okay, on the set in program P20, we read up previously that it wouldn't set in option 2. We've got a correction to that. It sets only in Options 0 and 4.
053:56:38|T|CMP|Understand; it sets in only Options 0 and 4.
053:56:40|C|Eng|That's correct.
053:58:06|T|CMP|Tony, I'm gonna try to get some pictures of selected portions of the suit donning on 16 millimeter. And I just checked here on the spotmeter, and it looks like the CIN is going to be marginal for this, and I'm looking at the - the BW that's available. And I wonder if anyone would object if I put it on magazine Hotel Hotel.
053:58:30|C|Eng|Okay, I'll check on that.
053:58:34|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
053:59:31|C|Eng|And, Ken, Houston.
053:59:36|T|CMP|Go ahead.
053:59:38|C|Eng|When you're ready for that Jet Monitor program, we're ready to load it.
053:59:45|T|CMP|Okay; I - I'm in P00, and I'll give you Accept.
053:59:49|C|Eng|Okay.
053:59:53|T|CMP|You've got it.
054:00:03|C|Eng|Okay, and I guess you'll have to go to P20 for us to load it.
054:00:10|T|CMP|Okay, you want me to be in P20 first.
054:00:13|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
054:01:51|T|CMP|Well, that was almost right.
054:02:15|T|CMP|You're in Accept P20.
054:02:20|C|Eng|Okay.
054:02:20|P|PAO|At 54 hours during the change of shift briefing, John Young and Charlie Duke entered the Lunar Module, Orion. They powered it up check the communications system, completed their housekeeping activities aboard the LM and are in the process of returning to the Command Module. The total time from the time the LM was switched to its own power until they were back on the Command Module providing power to the Lunar Module was about 21 minutes. Again, as on the two previous occasions when we've had a look at the Lunar Module systems when the data has been transmitted back to Earth all systems on that vehicle look good.

054:04:37|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
054:04:44|T|CMP|Go ahead.
054:04:45|C|Eng|Okay. We've got an answer here on this Hotel Hotel. You have about ten percent available to use now if you like, and if you use the spotmeter inside, you'll have to set it for an ASA of 4000.
054:05:00|T|CMP|That's affirmative, thank you. I can use ten percent.
054:05:04|C|Eng|That's right.
054:08:24|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
054:08:26|T|CMP|Go ahead.
054:08:28|C|Eng|Okay. We've got your program loaded. You can press on with the Noun 26.
054:08:35|T|CMP|You're gonna have to stand by a minute.
054:08:37|C|Eng|Okay.
054:12:16|T|CMP|Okay, Tony. What did you want? Noun 26 loaded up?
054:12:21|C|Eng|Right. You can go ahead and call your Noun 26.
054:12:28|T|CMP|Okay. I was - We're in the LM trying to get some pictures of their suit zipping up.
054:12:36|C|Eng|Roger. I'll bet that's a real hassle.
054:12:46|T|CMP|Yeah, it is.
054:14:47|T|CMP|Okay. Tony, does that - does that look right for a Noun 26?
054:14:52|C|Eng|Yeah, that looks right.
054:14:54|T|CMP|Thank you. The thing that I was questioning was the R36 not sliding over to the end.
054:15:04|C|Eng|Stand by one.
054:16:12|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
054:16:17|T|CMP|Go ahead.
054:16:18|C|Eng|Okay. If you'll call up Verb 05 26, it'll slide over. Right now you're not reading the third register.
054:16:29|T|CMP|Thank you. Okay. You want me to do a Verb 31?
054:16:33|C|Eng|That's affirmative.
054:17:15|C|Eng|Okay, Ken. It's running.
054:17:21|T|CMP|Okay, and are we gonna check out the alarm function, or are we just gonna check out the loading capability?
054:17:29|C|Eng|I think they've got something in mind for alarm function later, but nothing right now.
054:17:36|T|CMP|Okay, thank you. I'm gonna go back over and see if I can get some pictures from the LM then.
054:18:01|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
054:18:04|T|CMP|Go ahead.
054:18:06|C|Eng|I guess they'd like an E-Mod now.
054:18:14|T|CMP|You've got it.
054:18:16|C|Eng|Okay.
054:18:26|T|CMP|Anything else before I go over to the LM?
054:18:34|C|Eng|Everybody is shaking their head; I guess it's okay. About the time you get to the hatch, we'll think of something.
054:18:43|T|CMP|Okay.
054:30:16|T|CMP|And, Tony, we used only five percent on - it went from ten to 15 percent on magazine HH.
054:30:26|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. And when you get back in the Command Module there, we'd like for you to go to Block on the CM.
054:30:40|T|CMP|Okay. I'm Block, and Charlie's coming up on the comm, and I'm going to don my suit.
054:30:46|C|Eng|Okay.

055:06:06|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
055:06:09|T|LMP|Okay. We're back in the LM - I mean, correction - back in the Command Module, and Ken's closing out putting the probe in right now.
055:06:19|C|Eng|Okay. Sounds good. And there's no hurry on this, but when Ken gets all comfortable, we've got that Jet Monitor test.
055:06:35|T|LMP|Okay. Ken's busy. We'll give you a call.
055:06:38|C|Eng|Okay.
055:07:36|T|LMP|16 - Houston, 16.
055:07:38|C|Eng|Go ahead.
055:07:42|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by.
055:08:02|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, you read?
055:08:04|C|Eng|Sure do. Sounds - sounds good.
055:08:09|T|LMP|Okay. During the - the - suit donning went okay - in fact, pretty easy until we got to the part of zip - John and I zipping up. And in my suit in the LM, zipping up, John had an extremely difficult time getting the - the restraint zipper closed across the small of my back. It was extremely tight; the only way he was able to do it, was to zip the restraint - the restraint zipper in the front first, so that the zipper would line up a little bit better, and then he got the back part closed. Now the only thing that worries me is that the suit, to me, felt like I'd grown an inch or two, and it was tight in the legs, and I didn't have the LCG on. And with the LCG and everything else, it might have built up where it would have been really bad, and we were wondering if it might be possible to - if you guys would let us let the legs out on this suit maybe a half an inch to an inch. Over.
055:09:27|C|Eng|Okay. We'll talk about that. Go ahead.
055:09:32|T|LMP|Okay. I'm not even sure that would help, but it felt - it feels like it would to me.
055:09:37|C|Eng|Okay.
055:10:08|C|Eng|Charlie, I guess that gives us a data point -
055:10:10|T|LMP|Tony, there was no trouble at all with the - with the pressure sealing zipper or the pressure seal. It was just the - the restraint. It was just in that one place in the small of my back.
055:10:27|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that. I guess that gives us a data point. You grow in zero g.
055:10:34|T|LMP|That's what it feels like - that I stretched out an inch or so.
055:10:38|C|Eng|You better watch that; you're pretty close to your six feet.
055:10:43|T|LMP|Too late now.
055:11:02|T|LMP|Okay. Tony, the hatch is back in.
055:11:04|C|Eng|Okay.
055:15:32|T|CMP|Houston, are you still there?
055:15:37|C|Eng|Oh, yeah, Ken, we're still here. How are you doing?
055:15:44|T|CMP|Just fine. We got the tunnel closed out, and I'm ready to copy your next procedure.
055:15:48|C|Eng|Okay, stand by one.
055:16:32|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
055:16:37|T|CMP|Go.
055:16:38|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like you to disable all the B/D roll jets, and you're cycling against the stops about once every ten minutes, and so expect that you'll get your ISS light some time in there, and when you get it, we don't - you can turn back on the jets; we'd just like to look at it a while.
055:17:05|T|CMP|Okay. How about if I just go Free?
055:17:15|C|Eng|Okay. I guess the Free kills the Jet Monitor.
055:17:22|T|CMP|Oh, okay.
055:19:05|C|Eng|Ken, Just to verify that, if you go Free - CMC Free - the program doesn't monitor; if you go back to Auto, it does. You don't have to put the program back in.
055:19:19|T|CMP|Roger. I understand that. I guess I just wasn't thinking then. What I - what I did, Tony, was, rather than leave - leave two axes in control and one of them free, I put all the Manual Attitude switches to Accel Command, and we're still in CMC Mode, Auto.
055:19:37|C|Eng|Roger. We saw that down here. It looks good.
055:19:42|T|CMP|Okay. You can - you know, you can watch it all day long - whatever you want there.
055:19:47|C|Eng|Okay. We'll just watch.
055:26:11|T|CMP|Sure enough; there it is.
055:26:17|C|Eng|Okay. Seems to work.
055:26:20|T|CMP|And, sure enough, just like advertised, there's no status lights on - DSKY warning panel. And I'm gonna go ahead - if it's okay with you, I'll turn off the Channel 11, Bit 16.
055:26:36|C|Eng|Okay. Go ahead.
055:27:00|T|CMP|While we're still outside the dead band, that's not going to work unless I cycle it Free and back to recenter the dead band. You folks want to watch it outside the dead band for a while?
055:27:19|C|Eng|That's okay. I guess we're happy with it, and we'd like to go ahead and terminate it - terminate the -
055:27:27|T|CMP|Okay.
055:30:46|C|Eng|And, Ken, I guess you can go on to PTC at your convenience.
055:30:51|T|CMP|Okay. I was just getting ready to ask you about that. Thank you.
055:30:59|C|Eng|Okay.
055:31:14|T|CMP|Do you folks have me to continue using B/D roll?
055:31:22|C|Eng|Roger. B/D roll.
055:31:22|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 55 hours, 35 minutes. A short while ago Ken Mattingly reported that the tunnel had been closed out, indicating that Young and Duke had completed their suit exercise, were back in the Command Module. The tunnel hatch replaced after all of the probe and drogue assembly equipment had been reinstalled. And we heard Charlie Duke report that his suit - when John Young attempted to zip it up across the back appeared to feel tighter than he was used to feeling in that suit. Charlie said he didn't feel this would cause him any particular problems, but he was concerned that perhaps the length would be too short when the suit was pressurized, and suggested the possibility - or at least asked that the people here on the ground look into the possibility of lengthening the suit a bit using laces that are in the legs. This is a relatively minor adjustment and we're reviewing that possibility. And we will get back to Duke at sometime later in the mission with an evaluation of that suggestion. Following that, Ken Mattingly was involved in some activities using the onboard computer checking out a new program flying on this mission. This is a program which during Mattingly's solo activities in orbit around the Moon, would give him a warning using the Inertial Subsystem warning light on the Display Panel, to alert Mattingly to the fact that a thruster was stuck on - should one of the thrusters stick, for example during a sleep period, an opposing thruster would then begin to fire to counteract the effects of this, and the result being an unnecessary depletion of a thruster propellant. In order to avoid this sort of situation, a change has been made in the one of the erasable memory programs - or actually an erasable memory program has been added, which Mattingly will activate during that portion of the mission, and which would give him the warning through the inertial subsystem light, should one of the thrusters stick on. And then you heard the test of that program checked out and he got the light as expected. At the present time Apollo 16 is 172,327 nautical miles [319,150 kilometres] from Earth. And the spacecraft it traveling at a speed now of 3028 feet [923 metres] per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 55 hours, 35 minutes.

055:42:00|C|Eng|Okay, Apollo 16. Omni Charlie.
055:50:26|C|Eng|Charlie, Houston.
055:50:31|T|LMP|Go ahead.
055:50:33|C|Eng|Okay, On your tight suit, there, we were wondering if you could say a few words about how it felt during launch day.
055:50:43|T|LMP|Well, it was a little - little tight launch day. We'd - you know, fitted it pressurized, Tony, and it felt okay then. Launch day, I thought the legs were a little tight but not much.
055:51:03|T|LMP|Once we get it zipped, Tony, it feels a little tight, but pressurized it's okay. It's just the zipping part that's worrying us.
055:51:12|C|Eng|Understand.
055:51:37|C|Eng|Well, everybody is thinking about it, and we'll come back with an answer on it later. Right now I think the general feeling is that most people'd just as soon you not tamper with it unless you feel very strong about it.
055:51:58|T|LMP|Well, that's our opinion, too. Our next solution, or our next question is - is maybe breaking out with the LCG and putting all the gear on and seeing how it goes with all of the gear. Our question there is, if we break into one of the LCGs right now, will it affect - get any gas in the tubes; would it affect the startup on the PLSS?
055:52:35|C|Eng|Okay, we'll work that one.
055:53:33|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie, we've looked at that LCG problem and you're right. If you break it out early, we'll probably get gas in there and never be able to get it out, and it will affect your cooling.
055:53:49|T|LMP|Okay. John and I were going to break into those LCGs and sleep in them the night prior to PDI. What do you think about that idea, then?
055:54:06|C|Eng|Okay; they're over there scratching their head again.
055:59:24|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
055:59:34|T|CMP|Go ahead. Over.
055:59:36|C|Eng|Okay; your rates are low enough for the PTC.
055:59:42|T|CMP|Okay; thank you.
056:06:50|C|Eng|Apollo 16, Houston.
056:06:55|T|CMP|Go ahead.
056:06:56|C|Eng|Okay, we'd like your onboard reading of the H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 pressure.
056:07:26|T|CMP|270, Houston.
056:07:28|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that.
056:08:10|C|Eng|Okay, Ken. That's - that transducer problem, probably. They've had that history of problems with that transducer. Prelaunch.
056:08:20|T|CMP|Yeah, we remember that.
056:08:22|C|Eng|Okay.
056:08:30|T|CMP|It was glitching launch day, but it looks like now it's sort of stabilized.
056:08:35|C|Eng|Okay.
056:09:34|C|Eng|Apollo 16, Houston.
056:09:39|T|CDR|Go ahead.
056:09:40|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like you to go to Omni Bravo, and stow the High Gain. And we'll handle the switching.
056:09:47|T|CDR|Okay. You have Omni Bravo.
056:19:22|T|CMP|Houston, 16.
056:19:24|C|Eng|Go ahead.
056:19:29|T|CMP|Okay; we're getting reader to go to work on this Skylab food preparation bit, and we're trying to check out some camera settings and all. We've got 16-millimeter magazine allocated for this with CIN film in it, and by checking the most light that I can get on most objects, it looks like we'll be running with the lens wide open aperture at about 1/60 of a second. And I guess I'd like to know if you want to do that, or if you'd like to use a higher ASA and process the film differently.
056:20:12|C|Eng|Okay; we'll talk about that.
056:20:55|T|CMP|Tony, I was just looking here, and if we go to the 18-millimeter lens, we can open it up to a - to a T-1. And that gets our speed up to about 1/250. It looks like a lot better way to operate.
056:21:14|C|Eng|Ken, the comm's pretty bad right now. We're having a hard time getting that. We understood that the light meter indicates that the film that was indicated to use here probably isn't going to be fast enough, and you're asking to use a faster film. But we didn't und - get there, how severe the problem was.
056:22:47|T|CMP|Houston, 16.
056:22:50|C|Eng|Go ahead, Ken. The comm's still pretty bad, though.
056:22:56|T|LMP|Okay, we were going to get started on the bistatic radar frequency check, if you're ready.
056:23:27|C|Eng|Okay, Charlie, I guess we'd like for you to hold off for a minute on that VHF test.
056:23:35|T|LMP|All right.
056:23:58|C|Eng|Ken, Houston. The comm may be a little better now, if you'd go through the problem again.
056:24:05|T|CMP|Okay, Tony. It looks like it's not as bright in here as we'd like to be able to get it, and we'll try - try timing it with some of the window shades up to see if we can get it a little brighter. With the cabin floodlights, it looks like 1/60 of a second is about the max I can get off of the 10-millimeter lens. And I was going to suggest either going to the 18, which will give me a little faster shutter speed because it's got a wider aperture, or we'll take a little less photography and just do it when the Sun gives us good illumination through one of the windows.
056:24:46|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. We'll work it.
056:24:51|T|CMP|I think we can get more uniform photography if we did it with the window shades up and with all our lights in one fixed position. That way, we'll get a lot more photography done rather than having to wait. I really don't think you can afford to wait until the Sun's in just the right place to do your eating.
056:25:10|C|Eng|Roger. Understand.
056:25:14|T|LMP|Okay, Tony, we're going to restow my suit, if you guys don't want us to touch it.
056:25:22|C|Eng|Right, we're not gonna worry about it tonight. We'll have some sort of an answer tomorrow. So you go ahead and stow the suit.
056:25:32|T|LMP|Okay. And our H<sub>2</sub> tank pressure just went back - dropped back down to 240.
056:25:39|C|Eng|Okay. We saw that.
056:25:46|T|LMP|Hup! It's back up to 270.
056:31:45|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
056:32:12|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
056:32:17|T|CMP|Go ahead.
056:32:18|C|Eng|Okay. After much debate, I guess we can have you go ahead and use the 18 millimeter.
056:32:27|T|CMP|Okay; thank you.
056:32:29|C|Eng|All right. If you're not already done with it.
056:32:32|T|CMP|I really think we'll get the - We're - we're stowing one of our passengers here back in his suit bag.
056:32:40|C|Eng|(Laughter) All right.
056:32:41|T|CMP|And -
056:32:42|C|Eng|Okay, I - We're -
056:32:43|T|CMP|We're having - You'd be surprised just how long those kind of things take. You know, you start on something like that, and then it almost fits and you refold it, and it almost fits again, and it's only because you know it fits that you keep trying with it. Because you sure couldn't prove it by us.
056:33:00|C|Eng|Understand. It doesn't sound like too much fun. We'd like to reverse ourselves -
056:33:05|T|CMP|No, I didn't say that.
056:33:07|C|Eng|Right. We'd like to reverse ourselves on something I sent up awhile ago. It doesn't seem to be any problem with breaking out the LCGs early. They were thinking about a Skylab situation. So that won't be a constraint. As far as whether we want you to try it tomorrow, we'll work that and send it up tomorrow. But there'll be a -
056:33:30|T|CMP|Okay, I guess the only thing on that is that we've got a busy day coming, and these things just really take a long time by the time you put on the suit, and then you play with it and then if we have some adjustments to do, too, why, it's going to take a block of time.
056:33:45|C|Eng|Right. Understand.
056:33:46|T|CMP|So the sooner the better, I guess, which I know you know already.
056:33:49|C|Eng|Roger. But I particularly wanted to let you know there was no problem with sleeping in it that night before.
056:33:59|T|CMP|That's a big help. Thank you.
056:34:02|T|CDR|Yeah, I didn't think there was. That's what they did on Apollo 10.
056:34:08|C|Eng|Roger.
056:34:15|C|Eng|Remember Apollo 12, guys, before you do too much with that suit.
056:34:21|T|CDR|Okay.
056:34:40|T|CDR|Of course, the problem is going to be if we can't get it on at all. That's going to be a real problem.
056:34:46|C|Eng|Roger.
056:34:46|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 56 hours, 46 minutes. The crew should be shortly beginning their dinner which will include Skylab food items that they will be evaluating.

This was not worn during tonight's exercise and Duke suggested that it might be wise to put on the Liquid Cooled Garment at some time and try getting into the suit to see if there would be a problem when getting into the suit in the same configuration that they will be using the day of powered descent, the landing on the Lunar surface.

057:22:35|T|CMP|Roger, High Gain going to Wide, and terminate the VHF.
057:22:41|C|Eng|Roger.

057:23:05|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 24 minutes. The series of checks that we have been performing with the spacecraft using the onboard VHF and S-band systems are a preparation for an experiment that'll be performed in lunar orbit - the Bistatic Radar experiment which uses the spacecraft's communications equipment in a passive experiment to determine something about the electromagnetic properties of the lunar surface. The radio signals are reflected off the Moon, and the Moon affects the way in which they are reflected, and these characteristics are measured on Earth in an experiment performed by Taylor Howard of Stanford University. The VHF signals are received by the Stanford Research Institute in California, and the S-band signals are received by the Manned Spaceflight Network Station at Goldstone, California, the 210 foot antenna. Flight Dynamics officer advised us moments ago that while the crew is sleeping at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds, we're scheduled to cross that mythical line known as the lunar Sphere of Influence, the point of which we begin calculating the increasing of the lunar gravity on the spacecraft. Our displays here in Mission Control shortly after that point are generally switched over to Moon reference from Earth reference. The velocities that we have been watching decrease steadily up to now, will then begin to increase as the spacecraft is accelerated toward the Moon. At the present time we show Apollo 16 175,461 nautical miles [324,954 kilometres] from Earth, and traveling at a speed of 2,957 feet [901 metres] per second. As is usually the case when the spacecraft is this far from Earth, and when we're using the omni directional antennas and the spacecraft is rotating in the Passive Thermal Control mode, we do have some noisy communications as we drift from one antenna to the next. And this mission is no exception in that regard, and so we will have from time to time periods of noisy communications.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 24 minutes.

058:07:35|T|CMP|Houston, 16.
058:07:38|C|Eng|Go ahead, Ken.
058:07:43|T|CMP|We're trying to work on the presleep checklist, and this little part about the Optics to Zero and then the - Optics Power Off. Will any of that do these things we don't want to do with our TVC enable? How about just leaving it all like it is?
058:08:01|C|Eng|Okay; we're working on it.
058:12:01|T|CMP|Okay; Houston, you ready for the onboard read-out?
058:12:07|C|Eng|Yep. Go ahead.
058:12:28|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 16. Over.
058:12:32|C|Eng|Go ahead, Apollo 16. We're ready to take the read-out.
058:13:02|C|Eng|Apollo 16, Houston.
058:13:03|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 16. Over.
058:13:06|C|Eng|Okay. I guess we had a - a weak period there. Yes, we're ready for your read-out.
058:13:15|T|CMP|Okay, Battery C is 36.7. Pyro Batteries: A, 37; Pyro Battery B, 37; RCS A, 87; B, 90; C, 92; and D, 96. We're on Main A, 29 volts.
058:13:34|C|Eng|Okay; we copy that.
058:13:38|T|CMP|And you'll be happy to know we completed the Skylab Food Evaluation with very few casualties.
058:13:45|C|Eng|(Laughter) Congratulations.
058:13:47|T|CMP|And no loss of life.
058:13:49|C|Eng|Very good.
058:13:52|T|CMP|However, it took a lot longer than we allowed for it.
058:13:56|C|Eng|Okay.
058:14:23|C|Eng|And, Apollo 16, I guess it's okay to go to that Optics Zero in Zero, which you are, and G&amp;N Power Optics, Off.
058:14:33|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you now.
058:14:38|C|Eng|We aim to please.
058:19:06|T|CDR|Okay. Houston, are you ready for the E-memory dump? Over.
058:19:24|C|Eng|Okay, I guess we would just like you to skip the E-Mod.
058:20:55|C|Eng|And, Apollo 16; Houston.
058:21:30|C|Eng|Apollo 16, Houston.
058:22:59|T|CDR|Houston, you ready for a good old E-memory dump?
058:23:03|C|Eng|Okay, John; do you copy us now?
058:23:08|T|CDR|Yep, finally.
058:23:09|C|Eng|Okay, I think we'd like you to just skip that E-Mod tonight. We do have a couple of changes to Panel 230 when you get down that way.
058:23:25|T|CDR|Oh yeah; we plumb forgot about that. Okay, go ahead.
058:23:34|C|Eng|Okay. We'd like to - Pan Camera Self Test, Off.
058:23:40|T|LMP|That's Off.
058:23:42|C|Eng|Mapping Camera, Off.
058:23:47|T|LMP|That's Off.
058:23:48|C|Eng|And then down there below, the Service Module/AC Power, Off.
058:24:00|T|LMP|Okay, and that's Off.
058:24:02|C|Eng|Okay. That's all we've got.
058:44:09|T|CMP|..., 16. Can I talk to somebody about chlorine injection?
058:44:16|C|Eng|Okay. What's the problem?
058:44:26|T|CMP|I'm not sure what the first problem is; I can give you some symptoms. I put the chlorine in, and when I screwed down on it, it seemed like it was just a little bit stiffer to screw down on than they had been before. But it wasn't obvious that it was that much different; because they're always a little tight. And when I went to take it off, I got a whole lot of water bubbling out from around the - the port. And I couldn't tell where it came from. Seemed like it - the first thing I thought of was the same thing that happened to 15 with the nut backing off. And when I got it out, it looked like the - the bubbling seemed to stop fairly quickly, and then I - the first thing I tried to do was to tighten the collar of the adapter down tight, and right now I still have the chlorine injector adap - needle adapter still on the chlorine port. And I tightened it down by hand, and it seems like it's holding it. The chlorine ampoule itself was broken when we took it out of the injector drum. We got all of that mopped up, I wanted to get some buffer in with it - you know, the system, because it looked to me like some of the chlorine had gone in. So I started to try to put some buffer in, and it looked like it might of leaked a little bit. And then I went to take it out - out of the - take the injector out of the adapter, and when I did, it looks like it squirts fluid from two holes that are 180 [degrees] apart from each other on the adapter. And I guess I don't know what those two holes are for. It looks like maybe the needle is not going in, but I'm not sure what it is, now. Do you have someone that might know how to put it together?
058:46:32|C|Eng|Roger; we'll talk about that. I know all about those two holes in that adapter.
058:46:36|T|CMP|Okay, these are the two on the outside now.
058:46:37|C|Eng|Roger. I know exactly which ones you're talking about.
058:50:59|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
058:51:02|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
058:51:05|C|Eng|Okays, when you put that buffer in, would you verify that you left the nut all the way screwed down for the ten minutes and that's the period when the water was coming out the two holes.
058:51:22|T|CMP|No, the water comes out of those holes - Let's see now. I put the buffer in, I put it into the injector and then I put the injector into the adapter, and when I went to screw down on the injector, it looked like it was starting to seep fluid around the injector again. So I stopped, and it didn't look like it was doing any more, and I thought I would look and see. By this time, I was getting suspicious that maybe the needle wasn't open. So I decided to take the injector off of the needle adapter. I took it off, and everything looked okay. And it was when I went to put it back on, when I depressed the needle to - when you push the injector onto the adapter - that's when it looked like it squirted out of these two holes on the side and I did that several times and it repeated itself.
058:52:23|C|Eng|Okay, we copy that. Was the nut snugly against the ampoule when you tried to put it back on? If you backed off on the nut, it may have allowed the - it may have allowed the ampoule to slide back up in the compartment there and then you were just opening up the needle.
058:52:49|T|CMP|Well, I - I thought it was down snug. If it wasn't snug, would have - would it push water out of those two side ports?
058:52:59|C|Eng|Yes, it sure would. I had that happen in the prechlorination there on the pad before launch. I had backed off on the nut and, instead of just filling up that ampoule, the water pushed the ampoule off the needle and then, once it's done that, the water just goes back around and comes out those two holes.
058:53:29|T|CMP|Well, I can't say that didn't happen. The first problem occurred with the chlorine injection.
058:53:36|C|Eng|Right, I didn't see that on the pad.
058:53:42|T|CMP|Yep. My first problem was when I went to put the chlorine ampoule in. And at some point in there when I went to take it out, I tried to get it in and it didn't look right. When I went to take it out, it started bubbling all over, and I couldn't tell where it was coming from then. And whether it came from those two holes or not, that's quite possible. I'm not sure. When I looked at the ampoule itself, after I opened up the injector, you could see that the - the bottom lug had broken, the little sliding plug in there.
058:54:19|C|Eng|Right. Once that thing isn't watertight anymore, you'll get leakage into that container and that'll all come out those holes.
058:54:27|T|CMP|Okay. Then perhaps the only problem was the - was the one with the first ampoule breaking.
058:54:40|C|Eng|All right, we'll try to get you a procedure here and go back and try that buffer -
058:54:45|T|CMP|The ...
058:54:46|C|Eng|- again.
058:54:47|T|CMP|Say again.
058:54:48|C|Eng|I was going to say we'll try to get you to agree on a procedure here and then go back and try the buffer again.
058:54:54|T|CMP|Okay. I guess - yeah, we could do that.
058:55:00|C|Eng|Okay. Hold off on that. We'll - we'll get a procedure.
058:55:06|T|CMP|Okay. Is that something you want to do tonight or do it tomorrow?
058:55:10|C|Eng|You want that buffer in there tonight, don't you?
058:55:19|T|CMP|I don't know. It's a - I - I can't vouch for how much chlorine went in. Perhaps - very little. It's up to the - the guys who have plumbing responsibilities. I - I just can't tell you how much chlorine may have gotten in.
058:55:34|C|Eng|Okay, we understand.
058:56:00|C|Eng|Okay, Ken. I - I guess we'd like you to take that buffer ampoule again and screw the nut down on it so that you think it's - it's good - good and snug in there, and then put it on the adapter and see if you can - see if it'll take the buffer. Before you - you close it all up again, you might look at the ampoule to make sure it hasn't cracked.
058:58:21|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
058:58:57|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
058:59:01|T|CMP|Go ahead.
058:59:02|C|Eng|Did you get that about going ahead with the buffer?
058:59:05|T|CMP|No, I didn't.
058:59:06|C|Eng|Oh, okay; we probably had some bad comm there. We'd like you to take a look at that buffer ampoule and make sure it isn't cracked and, if not, then to go ahead and put it in that little container and screw that nut so you feel it's good and snug and then go ahead and see if it will take the buffer.
058:59:28|T|CMP|Okay. How about if I just take a brand new one? Don't we have a couple spares?
058:59:40|C|Eng|Okay. Yeah, they agree. Why don't you take a brand new one.
058:59:46|T|CMP|Okay. And while I'm doing that, I'm just looking over the gages, and I know our onboard gaging isn't the greatest thing in RCS. Could you tell me how we stand on RCS?
058:59:57|C|Eng|Okay. I'll get that.
059:01:10|C|Eng|And, Ken, at 54 hours, you were two percent ahead of your RCS budget - that's 25 pounds to the good.
059:01:23|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
059:01:24|C|Eng|Uh-huh.
059:01:25|T|CMP|... I guess we have a low bias in quad A and just kind of looks bad.
059:01:43|C|Eng|Okay. We - our bias is that you're reading 2 percent low on that.
059:01:56|T|CMP|Okay.
059:02:52|T|CMP|Okay. Tony, I've got the buffer in, and I noticed just a slight little spit when I put it in. That's probably residual. So I'll wait ten minutes and then suck it out.
059:03:01|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
059:06:05|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The O<sub>2</sub> Flow High and the cabin is pumped up to 5.7.
059:06:12|C|Eng|Okay. We copy that, John.
059:06:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9 minutes. The crew at this time completing the items on their checklist prior to getting an eight hour rest period. And we had a description from Ken Mattingly of some problems he was having getting the chlorine and buffer injected into the drinking water system. This is done with a syringe type device which injects the chlorine and the buffer alternately through a diaphragm in the waste - in the water management panel of the spacecraft. This is injected through with a hypodermic needle arrangement. And from the descriptions given by Mattingly and the discussions that he had with CapCom, Tony England, it appears that the problem he had was related to the way in which the ampoules of chlorine and particularly the buffer are placed in the syringe. They are held in place by the nut that screws down on the ampoule and a plunger device then is activated which drives the buffer out of the syringe and into the water supply. Apparently the nut is not down tight enough holding the - which would have allowed the process to ride up off the needle and instead of buffer being injected into the water, water was allowed to flow back out and come out of the syringe. Mattingly reported when he followed the procedure outlined by Tony England that apparently the buffer was injected properly and we believe that sufficient chlorine was injected to take care of the requirements there and the plan at this point is to put the crew to bed as soon as possible. At the present time we are showing Apollo 16 178,435 nautical miles [330,462 kilometres] from Earth and the speed of the spacecraft at this time 2,891 feet [881 metres] per second. In about eight minutes Apollo 16 will be crossing the imaginary line designating the lunar Sphere of Influence. At this point the Moon's gravitational force becomes the dominate gravity force acting on the spacecraft. And here in the control center our displays are monitoring the spacecraft velocity and altitude will switch over from Earth reference which we've been using the bulk of the flight to Moon reference. At that point the Earth will be 178,673 nautical miles [330,902 kilometres] from the spacecraft and the spacecraft will be 33,821 miles [62,636 kilometres] from the Moon. The velocity of the spacecraft with respect to the Earth at that point will be 2,887 feet [880 metres] per second and with respect to the Moon it will be traveling 3,482 feet [1,061 metres] per second. The time of that sphere crossing is 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9 minutes. The crew at this time completing the items on their checklist prior to getting an eight hour rest period. And we had a description from Ken Mattingly of some problems he was having getting the chlorine and buffer injected into the drinking water system. This is done with a syringe type device which injects the chlorine and the buffer alternately through a diaphragm in the waste - in the water management panel of the spacecraft. This is injected through with a hypodermic needle arrangement. And from the descriptions given by Mattingly and the discussions that he had with CapCom, Tony England, it appears that the problem he had was related to the way in which the ampoules of chlorine and particularly the buffer are placed in the syringe. They are held in place by the nut that screws down on the ampoule and a plunger device then is activated which drives the buffer out of the syringe and into the water supply. Apparently the nut is not down tight enough holding the - which would have allowed the process to ride up off the needle and instead of buffer being injected into the water, water was allowed to flow back out and come out of the syringe. Mattingly reported when he followed the procedure outlined by Tony England that apparently the buffer was injected properly and we believe that sufficient chlorine was injected to take care of the requirements there and the plan at this point is to put the crew to bed as soon as possible.

059:16:33|C|Eng|Ken, Houston.
059:16:50|T|CMP|Okay, Tony, got that buffer in and out, and all looks normal now.
059:16:54|C|Eng|Okay. Good show.
059:17:34|T|CMP|Houston, 16.
059:17:36|C|Eng|Go ahead, Ken.
059:17:43|T|CMP|Okay. Looks like we've got the buffer in and water back out, and everything looks normal now.
059:17:50|C|Eng|Good show. If - if you didn't get much chlorine in the buffer, won't hurt anything, but it would have hurt the other way if you'd put the chlorine in without adding the buffer, so - either way, we're in good shape now.
059:18:07|T|CMP|Okay. Then I guess our only problem then was just the fact that I probably broke that first chlorine ampoule some way.
059:18:16|C|Eng|Roger.
059:20:34|T|CMP|Okay, Tony. I guess I'm ready to give you a film status report.

059:21:18|C|Eng|Okay.
059:21:25|C|Eng|Okay. We copied all those.

059:22:49|T|CDR|- looks good to us, too.
059:22:50|C|Eng|Good show. And I guess there's nothing else down here. Would you like me to hum to you?

059:23:20|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 3 minutes. At present time we're in the midst of a shift handover in Mission Control. Our Flight Director Phil Shaffer is coming on to replace Flight Director Pete Frank. The spacecraft communicator on the on coming shift will be astronaut Hank Hartsfield replacing astronaut Tony England. And at present time Apollo 16 is 32, 321 nautical miles [59,858 kilometres] from the Moon. Traveling at a speed of 3,492 feet [1,064 metres] per second. During this past shift the major activities for the crew included another activation and check out of the Lunar Module. At 53 hours, 28 minutes, Duke and Young transferred into the LM and switched over from Command Module power for that vehicle to the LMS. All power systems, activated communications equipment and completed some general housekeeping activities aboard the LM. They then returned to the Command Module and all three crewmen donned their pressure garment assemblies, less helmets and gloves, and Duke and Young re-entered the Lunar Module checking out the procedures that they'll use the day of the lunar landing for suiting up and ingressing the Lunar Module. Following this exercise Charlie Duke reported that they had some difficulties when John Young attempted to close one of the large restrain zippers on Duke's suit. And he said when the zipper - when they tried to get the zipper closed across the small of his back that Young had to exert quite a bit of force to get the zipper to close. Later Charlie Duke reported that although he was not concerned that the suit would be comfortable once pressurized, there was some concern that they might have difficulties getting the suit zipped up when he was wearing the liquid cooled garment. And this is normally worn under the suits during the EVA's. It was not worn after the exercise tonight and Duke suggested that it might be a wise idea to try the suit with the liquid cooled garment underneath to make sure that it would be possible to close the zipper. And he also raised the possibility of lengthening the suit using series of laces which were built into the suit. Now we advised him to leave the problem where it was for tonight and we're going to be looking at it both here in the Control Center and in the Engineering Support rooms in Building 45. Also among our crew systems people and determine what the next step should be. There seems to be no undue concern about the problem here. The feeling was that if the suit fit during the time that it was worn for the launch, that it would fit prior to the lunar landing and the EVA's. However, we will be looking into the problem in more detail and coming up with some recommendations for the crew following their rest period. Also on the list of activities during this shift the crew ran a check of the equipment which will be used in the Bistatic Radar experiment while in lunar orbit. Transmitting S-band and VHF signals which we'll receive the VHF signal as was received at Stanford as it will be during the actual experiment in lunar orbit allowing scientist there to calibrate equipment and to determine the precise frequencies that the spacecraft equipment will be operating on. And there were a number of items from the Skylab food which were included in the menu for tonight's dinner. The astronauts were evaluating this food both it's packaging and ease of preparation. They were taking motion pictures and still photos of the preparation and will be providing post flight detailed reports on how this operation went. John Young made the comment that there were very few casualties and no loss of life following the use of the Skylab food. He did comment that it took as he put it a lot longer than they had allowed for. I think the supposition here in the Control Center was that he was talking for about the documentation procedures, the filming and the still photography. And we had one minor problem in the chlorination of the drinking water supply. This is done in two steps. Chlorine is injected using a hypodermic type syringe and this device injects the chlorine through a needle and then through a diaphragm which then allows it to be inter-mixed with the drinking water. This is followed with an injection of buffer and Ken Mattingly reported some difficulty in injecting the chlorine and he said when he checked the process which holds the chlorine was broken and he also said that when he tried to inject the buffer that instead of buffer going in, water came out. Tony England, Capsule communicator on this shift recalled having a similar experience prelaunch when he was chlorinating the drink water in the spacecraft on the launch pad. And we very quickly remedied that situation with a recommendation from England that the nut which holds the process into the syringe be firmly up against the syringe to permit the process from separating from the needle and allowing water to come out rather than buffer to be injected in. Mattingly double checked his procedure and tried again and the second time around reported that everything went as planned with no problem. Also on this shift we crossed this mythical line known as the Lunar Sphere of Influence at which point we begin calculating our spacecraft velocities and altitudes with respect to the Lunar Module. Also at this point that theoretically the moon becomes the dominant force acting upon the spacecraft from a gravity point of view and the spacecraft begins to accelerate towards the Moon. At that point Apollo 16 was 178,673 nautical miles [330,902 kilometres] from Earth and 33,821 nautical miles [62,636 kilometres] from the Moon. That event occurred at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. At 59 hours, 23 minutes or a little less than one hour ago, actually about 50 minutes ago, we said good night to the crew and we've heard nothing from them since. They have an eight hour rest period scheduled. During that time we will take the air-to-ground line down. We'll be recording any conversations should we have unscheduled or unexpected conversation with the crew. We'll play that back following receipt. And we'll be giving periodic status reports.

067:15:10|C|Har|Okay, we're waiting. Go ahead.
067:15:16|T|CMP|You're all 85-foot dishes, right? Ears, I mean.
067:15:23|C|Har|Roger. (Laughter)
067:15:31|T|CMP|All right, Henry. We'll start here on A section. All 22041; Alpha 3, 6 and 1/2, outstanding; Alpha 4, none; Alpha 5, 27 and 5; Alpha 6, 7, 10, and 5.

067:17:57|C|Har|Roger.
067:18:06|T|CMP|And off the gourmet sheet ...
067:18:08|C|Har|Stand by, Ken. We're coming up on an antenna switch and we'll lose comm for a few minutes.

067:20:42|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston.
067:20:52|T|CDR|Okay, go ahead.
067:20:55|C|Har|Okay. We're so far - You're so far out now that when we get close to antenna switching, we lose comm there for about a minute, a minute and a half. We're ready to copy the menu now; food.
067:21:14|T|CDR|Okay, our menu reporter is stealing a cup of coffee. He'll be with you in a second.
067:21:21|C|Har|Roger. And the surgeon compliments the reporter on the way he reads the report down.
067:21:39|T|CDR|Yeah, when you've got a college education, you learn to read, and boy anything can happen after that.
067:21:58|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. The happy gourmet says that for the Commander - Well, we'll start with meal A. And, stand by one.
067:23:01|T|CMP|Okay, on the Commander, you can delete the grits. On Meal B, we - we skipped the Skylab meal as Meal B and then ate it as Meal C. And on that, we skipped the peanuts. And for the second meal on the day, John had a grapefruit drink, bread with peanut butter, and - I guess that's it.
067:23:54|C|Har|Okay.
067:24:04|T|CMP|Okay. On mine, you can start on Meal A. Scratch the peaches, the scrambled eggs, four bacon squares, grits. My Meal B: I had the bread and peanut butter and the grapefruit drink. On the Skylab meal, I had one of the two rye breads and - out of all this chicken spread, no one ate a third of it, that's - we probably ate a tenth of it apiece. And for Charlie, he's been good. He eats everything. None of us ate the peanuts on the Skylab meal. And for the second meal of the day, Charlie had an orange-pineapple drink with potassium, and peanut butter. And you'll be happy to know that we shared our peaches with Casper. He ate just about as much of them as we did.
067:25:18|C|Har|Roger. Copy. That sounds kind of like it didn't work out too well.
067:25:26|T|CDR|There's a lot of peach still on Casper's face, I'll tell you that.
067:25:34|T|LMP|Hank, when you open that can, you get them all at once.
067:25:42|C|Har|Charlie, you're going to have to work on those guys about the grits.
067:25:48|T|LMP|Grits are good. I can't get them to eat them, though. They - I sur - ate part of John's.
067:26:00|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. And maybe I missed it here, somewhere, but could you give us some words on what you plan to do about Midcourse 4?
067:26:12|C|Har|Okay. No Midcourse 4. And, I got a couple items of news here, if you're interested in that.
067:26:23|T|CMP|Okay. Is that general interest news, or like how we handle our relay setting and so forth?
067:26:32|C|Har|Oh, it's just general interest stuff on - We're coming up on antenna switching.
067:26:40|T|CMP|Okay, we'll catch you after that.

067:29:46|T|CMP|Houston, you up yet?
067:29:48|C|Har|Okay, 16. How do you read?
067:29:49|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. How about if we stop PTC right here at this 144-degree pass?
067:30:14|T|CMP|Henry, did you copy that?
067:30:17|C|Har|Roger. We copied. And we got some Flight Plan updates for you, and you can stop it now if you like.
067:30:36|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
067:30:39|C|Har|Okay, repeat no MCC-4 is required, and for your information, the data there for the UV photos is good for an hour after the Flight Plan time. So there's no real rush on that one. if you're ready to copy, we'll just charge right into these Flight Plan changes. The first one is at 70 hours and ...
067:30:59|T|CDR|Okay, go.
067:31:00|C|Har|70 hours and 40 minutes. We want to write in there, "Charge Bat A," and that's, for your information, for about three hours and 20 minutes.
067:31:22|T|CDR|Okay. At 70:40 we'll charge Battery A, and that's roughly going to be in three and a half hours.
067:31:29|C|Har|That's affirmative. And at 71:20, we want to enter, "Load DAP with the weights and gimbal trim from MSFN, and call EMP 509.
067:32:03|T|CDR|Okay. At 71:20, we'll load the DAP with MSFN weight and gimbals and call EMP 509.
067:32:11|C|Har|That's affirmative. The next thing occurs at 73:55, at the sextant star check. Want to add, in parentheses, "No Verb 41. Manually - manual only with Verb 16 Noun 91.
067:32:45|T|CDR|Okay. I've got at 73:55, at the sextant star check, we'll do no Verb 41 and we'll do it manual with 16 91 as our check.
067:32:59|C|Har|That is affirmative. And EECOM advises you can ...
067:33:02|T|CDR|While we're on that, Henry - while we're on that one, Henry, I didn't see where we terminated 509. Do we keep it running all this time?
067:33:14|C|Har|That is affirmative.
067:33:20|T|CDR|Thank you.
067:33:24|C|Har|Okay. And EECOM advises you can go ahead and start that battery charge now, if you want to get Charlie started on that. And, next thing occurs at 74:08. And there we do the "Do SPS cue card through gimbal drive.
067:34:01|T|CDR|Okay, that's at 74:08. It's SPS cue card through gimbal drive.
067:34:08|C|Har|Roger. And LOS - MSFN LOS time will be 74:18.
067:34:18|T|CDR|Okay, 74:18 is LOS.
067:34:26|C|Har|Okay, that's the Flight Plan changes. I have some notes now. I don't know where's the best place to copy these. I've got about nine or ten of them here. Well, take it back. I got two notes on the use of EMP 509, and they read as follows.
067:34:46|T|CDR|Okay, let me get my scratch pad out and I'll copy those first.
067:35:15|T|CDR|Okay, Henry. I'm ready to copy your notes.
067:35:20|C|Har|Okay. Number one: the TVC DAP is unstable with EMP 509.
067:35:48|T|CDR|Okay, understand. The TVC DAP is unstable with 509 running.
067:35:53|C|Har|That is affirmative. And number two is, "At SPS cutoff plus 2.5 seconds, the TVC enable is de-energized." The EMP is off; thus, the platform alignment could be lost.
067:36:27|T|CDR|Okay.
067:36:32|C|Har|Okay, and I have some Flight Plan changes now that are concerned with DOI. The first one occurs at seven ...
067:36:42|T|CDR|Stand by a second.
067:36:43|C|Har|All right.
067:37:32|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. I'm ready. These are comments, or these are things to go into the Flight Plan?
067:37:38|C|Har|Roger. These are Flight Plan changes, Ken. I'm sorry I didn't get this in order a while ago. It was buried in the bottom here.
067:37:48|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
067:37:50|C|Har|Okay, at 77:57, there's a group of CSM systems checks. Move those up to 77:20.
067:38:22|T|CMP|Okay, we take the CSM systems checks and move them from 77:58 over to 77:20.
067:38:31|C|Har|That's affirmative. Now at 77:50, "Verb 48 21101 01111.
067:39:00|T|CMP|Okay. At 77:50, that's "Verb 48 into 21101 01111.
067:39:09|C|Har|That's affirmative, and immediately following that, "Start EMP 509.
067:39:38|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. I guess I don't quite understand the loading the - the Verb 48 into 21101, and then the next thing we do is to load a three in there. Could you have someone give me some rationale on that?
067:39:55|C|Har|The difference there, Ken, is you - when you're loading that Verb 48 for the - the EMP 509, you don't Pro on that one and activate that DAP.
067:40:09|T|CMP|Okay, I see what you're saying. All right.
067:40:13|C|Har|In other words, we have to get the right DAP in there before we do the EMP 509. The next item is the activities that are located between 78:03 and 78:08, we want to move back to just following the P52 at 77:53.
067:40:43|T|CMP|Okay. How about giving me the first line and last line on the block you're talking about.
067:40:48|C|Har|Okay, that's "P30, verify DOI T<sub>IG</sub> and Delta-V<sub>s</sub>" through "Acquire MSFN Omni D." Move all of that back to just following the P52, or "landing site orient" at 77:53. And in that group of activities, we want to delete that Verb 48.
067:41:39|T|CMP|Okay, now what I have is - have you got any more changes to this area, and then I'll read you what I have sequentially.
067:41:47|C|Har|There's nothing more on that particular page, 77 through 78 hours.
067:42:04|T|CMP|Okay. Maybe I missed something here, but I have - I have not seen us - terminate 509. I'm sure we did somewhere before the LOI burn -
067:42:18|C|Har|Uh ...
067:42:19|T|CMP|... and we'll do it again.
067:42:20|C|Har|We're going to get to do - in that Ken, we're going to have that on your cue card. I've got cue card change coming up for you.
067:42:28|T|CMP|Okay. All right, let me give you what I have here and then - At 77:20, I do all the CSM systems checklist items that are listed now at 77:58. At 77:50, we do a Verb 48 21101 01111. We start EMP 509. Then, at about 77:55, we do all the steps which are presently listed at 78:03 down through 78:08.
067:43:08|C|Har|And that's with the exception of the Verb 48.
067:43:13|T|CMP|That's right; with the exception of Verb 48.
067:43:19|C|Har|Okay, that's all correct. Now, the next item is, at 78:22, we delete the sextant star check and move it back to 78:15. And it carries the same warning as we had before. No Verb 41, manual only with the Verb 16 Noun 91.
067:43:55|T|CMP|Okay, that's a sextant star check at 78:15 with no Verb 41, doing it manually and deleting the star check at 78:22.
067:44:04|C|Har|That's affirmative. And the last item for this is, at 78:18 add "do SPS cue card through gimbal drive.
067:44:38|T|CMP|Okay; that is at 78:18, it's "Do SPS cue card through gimbal drive.
067:44:45|C|Har|Roger. And the cue card that you'll use is the same for LOI and DOI. We're going to read you those changes.
067:44:57|T|CMP|Okay.
067:45:34|C|Har|16, Houston. I have your SPS burn card changes whenever you're ready to copy.
067:45:43|T|CMP|Go ahead.
067:45:51|C|Har|Okay. Just as a note here for yourself. You load the DAP before starting the card, and you do not change Verb 48 after starting EMP 509. Now, we tried to indicate that in the Flight Plan, and I explained that to you while ago. Okay, first step: at the top of the card, the very first item, add "EMP 509 called.
067:46:31|T|CMP|Okay, at the very top of the card, it's "EMP 509 is called.
067:46:37|C|Har|Roger. And down at the fifth item, where it says "Load DAP," delete that.
067:46:48|T|CMP|Okay, we'll delete "Load DAP.
067:46:52|C|Har|Where it says "Boresight &amp; sextant star check," delete the "Verb 41 Noun 91 Enter," and make the comment: "No Verb 41, manual only with Verb 16 Noun 91.
067:47:18|T|CMP|Okay, we delete "Verb 41 Noun 91," and we say "No Verb 41, manual Verb 16 Noun 91.
067:47:27|C|Har|That's affirmative. At the left of the card opposite "Main bus ties," where it says "54 minutes,'' change that to "40 minutes," and in parentheses "Minus 20 minutes.
067:47:57|T|CMP|Okay, we've changed "54 minutes" to "40 minutes," and "Minus 6" to "Minus 20.
067:48:03|C|Har|Roger. And down a little further where it says "55 and 5," we want to change that to "41 and minus 19.
067:48:21|T|CMP|Okay. We've changed "55" to "41" and "minus 5" to "minus 19.
067:48:31|C|Har|Okay, on the back side of the card - Let me read you the whole thing we want to get in there, Ken, so you'll know how to squeeze it. Right after it says "Accept parentheses Pro," we want to get in there, "If glitch occurs, use RHC to stop maneuver Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter, Verb 40 Enter, Verb 62 Enter. Manual maneuver to attitude," so you have to kind of squeeze that in there a little bit. I'll read it to you slowly now. "if glitch occurs ...
067:49:02|T|CMP|Okay, stand by a minute.
067:49:44|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead, Hank.
067:49:46|C|Har|Okay. "If glitch occurs, use RHC to stop maneuver. Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter. Verb 40 Enter. Verb 62 Enter. Manual maneuver to attitude.
067:49:46|P|PAO|Apollo Control, Houston 67 hours 50 minutes into the mission. We're listening to CapCom Hank Hartsfield pass along flight plan updates to the crew of Apollo 16.</p>   <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control, Houston 67 hours 50 minutes into the mission. We're listening to CapCom Hank Hartsfield pass along flight plan updates to the crew of Apollo 16.
067:50:46|T|CMP|Okay, now, this says that - this is after the Pro on gimbal test, and we're saying that if we - you get one of these glitches, use the RHC to stop the rates. Would there be any objection to just switching to SCS while we do the rest of this, and that's my question. Now I'll read on. It's "Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter," and I have a question there, is that - I got the impression from what we were saying in our previous discussion that this wasn't restricted just to the middle gimbal; it's a possibility for - for the others. And then a "Verb 40 Enter," which will release the platform. Verb 62 will take us back. It's not - it's not clear to me, once we've put in Noun 20 as zero, that Verb 62 is a useful number. It seems to me that I must have skipped something here.
067:51:54|C|Har|Okay, I am a little puzzled about the Verb 62 needles. However, on the other item, the reason you only need a Verb 23 is that the - that zeros that CDU, which is the only one that locks you up in coarse align, and the others will reinitialize when we do the Verb 40.
067:52:19|T|CMP|Okay, I guess my question, though, is that, if it can happen in each of them, the only time you do the Verb 23 Noun 20 would be in the event that it did lock into the coarse align.
067:52:36|C|Har|That's affirmative. GDO was just saying you cover all bets when you do this, and you don't have to stop and think about it.
067:52:46|T|CMP|Okay, but if you had moved off in yaw, it seems to me I would be possibly introducing more error -
067:53:33|C|Har|Ken, would you - would you - state your concern again so we've got a clear picture of it.
067:53:41|T|CMP|Okay - maybe I'm off on a tangent. What it looked to me like is that if you pick up one of these glitches, I'm not sure that the rates are all going to be confined to just - just one axis by the time it stops, and if you then take and load Register 3 and Noun 20 to zeros, you may, in facts be at some other middle gimbal angle than zero. So, once you do that - I guess that - that has no effect if I do a Verb 40, huh? I guess that's the - I missed that point. That merely gets me out of the coarse align, and -
067:53:26|C|Har|That - that's affirmative.
067:53:27|T|CMP|- Verb 40 will be initialized. Is that correct?
067:53:29|C|Har|That's affirmative. The Verb 40 starts the whole thing running again.
067:54:32|T|CMP|Okay.
067:54:33|C|Har|The Verb 23 Noun 20 gets you out of the gimbal lock, if that's to be - if that's the case.
067:54:40|T|CMP|Okay. Now I'm with you. Now I guess the only other thing is that, in the event that we have the thing we had - that happened the other night and it did coarse align there, it seems to me that, before I do the Verb 40, I would want to fly back on SCS to zero middle gimbal angle. Is that correct?
067:55:02|C|Har|That's affirmative.
067:55:09|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, I think I understand that. Thank you.
067:55:23|C|Har|The concern over using the SCS, Ken, was they were afraid you'd introduce a transient - another transient in there by the switching. However, if - you can't do - can't null it out with the RHC, you might be forced into SCS.
067:55:45|T|CMP|Well, we'll sure give it a try. It's just not - Perhaps once I just get the hand controller out of detent, that'll stop it at whatever new attitude it has, and that - that ought to hold it, so that there may be no further transients. I'll try that first.
067:56:00|C|Har|Roger. Are you ready to go on with changes?
067:56:05|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
067:56:07|C|Har|Okay, out to the side there - a little arrow, I guess, is the best way to indicate it - in other words, between "Rate, High" and "EMS, Normal," we want to say "Terminate EMP 509.
067:56:50|T|CMP|Okay, when I terminate the EMP 509, you want me to write that between Rate, High and EMS to Normal? And it looks like the - I would do the Verb 48 back to my original values, but it looks like I would not be resetting the Average g flag. Or do you want that reset anyhow?
067:57:16|C|Har|Stand by, Ken.
067:57:32|C|Har|Ken, the message is do a normal terminate as - as on the procedure they read up to you: and that's after you finish the gimbal drive test. That's what it's associated with. And following that - the next item - just prior to 59 minutes - I don't know how you're going to get all of this in there. You may have to write it to the bottom and show an arrow. "At minus 6 minutes, Tape Recorder High BIT Rate, Record, Forward, Command Reset.
067:58:09|T|CMP|And you did not want to do that at minus 20? Is that affirmative?
067:58:15|C|Har|That's affirmative.
067:58:21|T|CMP|You want me to - to delete that from minus 20?
067:58:24|C|Har|Yes, I omitted that, Ken; I was going back to that. Back over here at minus 20, we want to delete - scratch through "Tape Recorder, High BIT Rate, Forward, Command Reset." And for your info, the reason we've given this 20 minutes is in both LOI and DOI, that gives us about ten minutes to watch what you're doing, watch the gimbal drive check, and if you need any help, we can give it to you from down here.
067:58:58|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds like a good plan.
067:59:17|T|CMP|Okay. You want the tape recorder, On, at minus six minutes.
067:59:20|C|Har|That's affirmative.
067:59:28|T|CMP|Okay, Go ahead.
067:59:29|C|Har|Okay. Following 00:XX ECO, enter - right in there - "Be prepared for SCS takeover.
068:00:02|T|CMP|Okay; I got that.
068:00:33|C|Har|You ready for the next one, Ken?
068:00:38|T|CMP|Yeah, go ahead.
068:00:40|C|Har|Okay. Right after "TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2, Off," we want to enter a little comment that says, "Prior to trimming Noun 85, Noun 20 should be checked against the IMU.
068:01:25|T|CMP|Okay, after "TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2, Off," and we'll put a note here that says, "Prior to trimming Noun 85, check Noun 20 against IMU," and that's because of reading the different angles of the FDAI pickoff.
068:01:40|C|Har|That's affirmative.
068:01:45|T|CMP|Okay.
068:01:51|C|Har|Okay. Now I have changes for your SPS burn rules card.
068:01:59|T|CMP|Stand by. Let me read back what I got on here.
068:02:07|C|Har|Go ahead.
068:02:09|T|CMP|On the SPS card, starting at the top with a note. Can you read me all right now, Hank?
068:02:14|C|Har|Roger.
068:02:28|T|CMP|Okay. At the top of the card, I've added a note that says, "No Verb 48 changes after entering 509. The first step on the card is "EMP 509 is called." I have deleted, "Load the DAP." Under the "Boresight sextant star check," I have deleted Verb 41 Noun 91. I have replaced that with a note that says "No Verb 41 and use manual, monitor 1691." I have changed the "Bus Tie, on" time from 54 minutes to 40 minutes, and that changes "minus 6" to "minus 20." I have deleted the tape recorder line at minus 6 minutes. I've changed the time 55 to be 41, minus 5 to be minus 19, and that's all the changes I have on the front side of the burn card. On the back side, next to the "Proceed after the gimbal test option": if the - if we get a glitch, it's "RHC to stop rates, Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter, Verb 40 Enter, and then Verb 62 Enter, manually maneuver to attitude." After "Rate, High," and before 59 minutes, terminate EMP 509. At minus six minutes, "Tape Recorder goes to High BIT Rate, Record, Forward, and Command Reset." At 00:XX, at engine cut-off, it's "Be prepared for SCS takeover." At "TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2, Off," we've added a note, "Prior to trimming Noun 85, check Noun 20 against the IMU." And that's all the comments I have on the burn card.
068:02:28|||<p class="tech"><b>068 04 5B Hartsfield:</b> That's a good readback, Ken, and just to reiterate, that "Terminate EMP 509" is associated with terminating the gimbal test or ending up on that.
068:05:07|T|CMP|Roger. Any - I can do that any time after the gimbal test is completed.
068:05:12|C|Har|That's affirmative.
068:05:17|T|CMP|Okay.
068:05:23|C|Har|We would prefer that termination right after the gimbal check.
068:05:30|T|CMP|Yes sir. I don't want to get caught too late doing that.
068:05:34|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. This procedure, it'll handle no matter what glitch we get, and I understand that. But how about some discussion of the probability of getting such a glitch. Is there any - anybody thinking about that much, down there?
068:06:02|C|Har|I guess all of us have been thinking about it, John, but there's just no way we can predict whether it will happen again or not. Our gut feeling on the thing is that probably never see it again.
068:06:21|T|CDR|Understand. It's very similar to the kind of thing that we had happen back in the early part of the Apollo Program with the CDUs that would make them count different. Is that not correct?
068:06:39|C|Har|That's affirmative.
068:06:46|T|CDR|Okay, thank you.
068:06:50|T|LMP|Houston, 16. Ready to copy the SPS burn rules update.
068:06:55|C|Har|Okay, the reason for these changes, Charlie, is after we watch MC-6 and look at the system pressures there, we got some new data; and, for your information, we're kind of predicting that your nominal values are going to be oxidizer 200, fuel 170, and - for your onboard readings. So based on that, we need to change these burn rules. And I believe you've already made one change to it, is that correct?
068:07:27|T|LMP|Yeah, but we got - I can scratch it in again somewhere else.
068:07:32|C|Har|Okay, on the Fuel Oxidizer press, where you put in 124 Oxidizer, you want to change that to 138 Oxidizer, and the Fuel goes from 110 to 112. In other words, instead of 124 Ox, 110 Fuel, we want 138 Ox, 112 Fuel.
068:08:07|T|LMP|Okay, copy. Go ahead.
068:08:09|C|Har|Okay, for your Fuel Oxidizer Delta-P, the new rules are: "Oxidizer greater than fuel by 50" to "Oxidizer greater than Fuel by 12.
068:08:36|T|LMP|Now wait a minute, I had "50 Ox less than Fuel" last time.
068:08:48|C|Har|Okay, but - but what - what you had before, I think was 35 and 5. Is that correct?
068:08:59|T|LMP|Oh, okay. You're right, 35 and 5. Okay, go ahead again now.
068:09:03|C|Har|Okay. The new ones become "50 Oxidizer greater than Fuel" to "12 Oxidizer greater than Fuel." In other words, your 35 and 5 rules go to 50 and 12. Both of them, though "Oxidizer greater than Fuel." What we're changing is the 35 to 50, and we're changing the 5 to 12 and changing the sign over there, "Oxidizer greater" instead of "Oxidizer less.
068:09:46|T|LMP|Okay. What you are telling me, that's the limit; "50 - Oxidizer greater than Fuel" can be as high as 50 or as low as 12.
068:09:56|C|Har|That's affirmative. 'Oxidizer greater than Fuel" in both cases, in other words, your range is oxidizer 12 to 50 psi greater them the Fuel pressure,
068:10:12|C|Har|Okay, and on your tight limit ...
068:10:14|T|LMP|Okay.
068:10:15|C|Har|... change the Oxidizer to "168 Oxidizer". What - what you have there is "168 Oxidizer, 153 Fuel." Want to change that to "183 Oxidizer, 153 Fuel"; no change in the Fuel.
068:10:51|T|LMP|Okay, copy tight limits: Oxidizer has to be greater than 183 and the Fuel greater than 153.
068:10:59|C|Har|That's affirmative.
068:11:26|T|LMP|Okay, Hank. Let me give you an example here on this Delta-P<sub>s</sub>. Right now, I'm looking at about 170 Fuel and 195 Oxidizer. That says that I can go to - down to 150 - 140 on the Fuel side with a constant Oxidizer pressure before I reach my limit, or have the Fuel pressure increase up to 178 before I reach my limit. Is that correct?
068:12:06|C|Har|G&amp;C's checking. Let him look at it, Charlie.
068:12:17|T|LMP|Okay.
068:13:56|C|Har|Charlie, that Fuel follows Delta-P of 50, Oxidizer follows Delta-P of 12. That was the answer I got back on that; however, on the example you gave, I thought you were right with it, except on the second part. It looked like to me you need a 12 difference there. I might of misread the thing.
068:14:24|T|LMP|Okay. I was just looking at my gages here, I've got about 190 Oxidizer pressure, and about 165 Fuel pressure. And so that says to me that the Fuel side could go up to 178 and I'd still be within the limit.
068:14:48|C|Har|That's what the rules say.
068:14:54|T|LMP|Okay.
068:15:02|C|Har|The Oxidizer could drop to 177.
068:15:12|T|LMP|Roger.
068:15:17|T|CMP|Roger.
068:15:24|T|CMP|Hank, do we have to get a SPS press light along with - and still be within limits on these rules.
068:15:33|C|Har|Stand by.
068:15:48|C|Har|They're checking their cal cards now, Ken. They're going to come up with an answer on that.
068:15:55|T|CMP|All right; thank you.
068:16:16|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The pressure equalization valve is coming open to equalize the tunnel pressure.
068:16:24|C|Har|Omni Alfa, 16.
068:16:38|C|Har|16, G&amp;C advises use the pressures and not the light in regard to the burn.
068:16:52|T|CMP|Roger. I'm just wondering if I'm - should expect to see it?
068:16:57|C|Har|That's affirmative. You may. We think the light will come on at 202 oxidizer pressure and we're predicting you going to be running around 200.
068:17:36|T|CMP|Houston, would you like to have the high gain antenna?
068:17:43|C|Har|That's affirmative. Flight Plan angles, Ken.
068:18:31|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The pressure equalization valve is closed. The CM Delta-P is 0.2 now.
068:18:37|C|Har|Roger; copy 0.2.
068:18:47|T|CDR|And I think that - that 0.2 is what it reads whenever it's equalized.
068:18:53|C|Har|Roger; that's true.
068:19:12|C|Har|And, 16, we'd also like to advise that, on the tight limits, you're within 2 psi on the low pressure side for the fuel.
068:19:26|T|CDR|Okay.
068:19:31|C|Har|And, 16, I have your Pericynthion-Plus-2 block data.
068:19:40|T|LMP|Okay. Why don't you just stand by on that and let us get these photos out of the way.
068:19:43|C|Har|Will do.
068:20:46|T|CMP|Hey, Hank, Charlie just noticed that we're in this Moon photo attitudes and it looks like the - the Sun is just very, very close to being along our line of sight, and it looks like we have - On one of the changes, we've gone in and opened some of these settings. Could we get a verification that where we - that this is the right setup? We can't look out the window very well and tell you if we're boresighted on the Moon.
068:21:22|C|Har|Roger, Ken. This is a correct attitude. We'll take another quick scan of the settings.
068:21:38|C|Har|16, Houston. Would you attempt to bring up the high gain?
068:22:02|T|LMP|Okay, you've got Reacq in there. How does that look?
068:22:15|C|Har|Looks good, Charlie; and, in regards to the photos, the PI says the Sun will be very close to the Moon, but that it shouldn't be in the field of view of the camera. The settings are good.
068:22:36|T|LMP|Okay, we'll take them as is.
068:26:53|C|Har|Hey, Charlie. I've got a message for you. Consolidated Jack Pines is way up.
068:27:03|T|LMP|Great; thank you.
068:27:04|T|CDR|So's Charlie.
068:27:26|C|Har|16, Houston. I'm - we're going to do the changeover now, and I'll see you later on this evening.
068:27:35|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Thank you, sir.
068:27:49|T|CDR|Yeah, y'all go get some rest. It'll be a busy day later on.
068:27:54|C|Pet|They're already on the way.
068:28:02|T|CDR|Hello there.
068:28:04|C|Pet|Hello there. Wanted to advise you, you can relax now. You're in good hands now with the Gold Team.
068:28:19|T|CDR|Understand the Gold Team is got gone.
068:31:41|T|LMP|Houston, 16. I'm ready for the block data update.
068:31:45|C|Pet|Say again, 16. You're very weak.
068:31:53|T|LMP|Yeah, that's because my mike's about 25 inches away. How's that?
068:31:58|C|Pet|That's a lot better, Johnny [sic].
068:32:02|T|LMP|Okay, I'm ready for the block updates.
068:32:06|C|Pet|Roger. Okay, Charlie, it's Per[icynthion] Plus 2, SPS/G&amp;N; 66363 ...
068:32:24|T|LMP|Wait; hold the - hold the phone - hold the phone a minute, Pete.
068:32:28|C|Pet|Okay.
068:32:33|T|LMP|Okay, I was on the P37. This is the P30 Pad?
068:32:38|C|Pet|This is your abort Pad. Per Plus 2 Abort. It's a P30 load.
068:32:54|T|LMP|Okay; go ahead.
068:32:56|C|Pet|Okay, it's Per Plus 2, SPS G&amp;N; 66363 plus 1.21, minus 0.14; 076:26:14.49; Noun 81's, plus 2133.7, plus 1123.3, minus 2178.1; 335, 116, 018. Rest of the pad is NA. Ullage, none. Under others: number 1, docked manuever; 2, based on LOI REFSMMAT; 3, gimbal angles on PTC REFSMMAT are roll, 263; pitch, 017; yaw, 310.
068:34:33|T|CDR|Roger, Pete; 30 Pad, Pericynthion, Per Plus 2, SPS G&amp;N; 66363; plus 1.21, minus 0.14; 076:26:14.49; plus 2133.7, plus 1123.3, minus 2178.1; 335, 116, 081 - correction 018. Rest of the pad is NA. Ullage is none. It's a docked maneuver, based on the LOI REFSMMAT. On a PTC REFSMMAT, the gimbal angles are 263, 017, and 310.
068:35:14|C|Pet|That's affirmative, Charlie, and the yaw is 018.
068:35:22|T|CDR|That's affirmative; 018.
068:35:24|C|Pet|Okay.
068:36:17|C|Pet|You can go ahead. No sweat on the alert.
068:36:24|T|CMP|Roger; just going to let it time out.
068:38:48|C|Pet|Okay, you can go ahead and torque them.
068:38:50|T|CDR|You have the torquing angles?
068:38:52|C|Pet|Roger; we got them. You can go ahead and torque them.
068:38:59|T|CDR|Okay, I'll torque them at 39.
068:39:12|T|CDR|That sure is a mighty super little platform, isn't it.
068:39:16|C|Pet|Yeah, it's looking real sweet.
069:00:29|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
069:00:31|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
069:00:35|T|LMP|Okay, Pete, how about giving us a little recap on Midcourse-2 burn as far as what y'all saw as chamber pressures and interface pressures? And how did the old SPS look, versus the calibrations?
069:00:52|C|Pet|Roger. Stand by. We'll get it for you.
069:18:11|C|Pet|16, Houston. I've got the figures on this burn that you wanted, and I guess I can start out by talking about the meter biases to make sure that we're clear on that. There's a 15-psi bias on the oxygen tank pressure. It's reading high. On top of that, there is a meter bias of eight psi, which is also high, so that our total bias on the oxygen onboard pressure reading is about 23 psi high - oxidizer, I'm sorry. And, on the fuel, it's seven low, total, which is a meter bias.
069:19:03|T|LMP|Okay, we understand.
069:19:05|C|Pet|Okay. Then, with those numbers in mind, the chamber pressure during that burn was 100 psi, and the numbers that you should have read on board prior to the burn were oxidizer tank pressure 205 and fuel tank pressure 177. And, after the burn, the numbers you should have been reading were 197 oxidizer and 170 fuel. In other words, they both dropped - well, fuel - oxidizer dropped eight and fuel dropped seven psi during the burn. The interface pressures preburn were oxidizer 184 and fuel 187; and, during the burn, they were 168 oxidizer, 172 fuel. And, after the burn, the interfaces were oxidizer 174 and fuel 179. And all those look good to us.
069:20:26|T|CMP|Roger. We got you.
069:20:28|C|Pet|Okay, I don't know whether you noticed your pressures during the burn. It was a pretty short burn, but the oxidizer tank should have read about 205 and the fuel tank about 175, during the burn.
069:20:43|T|CDR|Charlie was watching them.
069:20:45|C|Pet|Okay.
069:20:48|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. During the burn, when the engine came on, the pressure started down.
069:20:55|C|Pet|Roger. That's what - that's what should have happened. It was at 205 and 177 preburn and went to 197 and 170 postburn. That's oxidizer and fuel, respectively. And that's ...
069:21:12|T|LMP|Okay, that's what we saw.
069:21:13|C|Pet|Roger. And that - and our guys say that's - a - that's a - The figures look real good to them. That's the kind of performance they expected.
069:21:28|T|LMP|Okay, now for LOI. When the engine comes on, the helium valves open, and I can expect the pressures to rise and my gage reading for oxidizer to sit around 200 and, for fuel, to be around - 1 - 175?
069:21:46|C|Pet|Around 1 - that's 200 on oxidizer and around 170 on fuel, Charlie.
069:21:53|T|LMP|Okay, fine.
069:28:10|T|CMP|Houston, Casper.
069:28:13|C|Pet|Go ahead, Casper.
069:28:18|T|CMP|Could you have somebody put a few words together for me on what happens if the IMU gets coarse aligned while Average g is still on? I'm thinking about the - at the end of the burn.
069:28:32|C|Pet|Okay, you - you're wondering about the situation when - if you get the glitch after the burn but while average g is still running?
069:28:43|T|CMP|Yes, sir. There's no chance of terminating Average g before that happens, and I'd kind of like to have some idea of what I might expect the - the navigation to do.
069:28:55|C|Pet|Roger. We - we'll get you an answer on that, Ken.
069:29:00|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
069:30:50|C|Pet|16, Houston. Can you - can you check for us and let us know whether Ken is on the biomed? Is Ken hooked up on the biomed? We're getting some strange readings. Could be a loose sensor.
069:31:08|T|CMP|It's pretty - it's pretty loose now; it's in my pocket.
069:31:11|C|Pet|If it's in your pocket, that might account for it.
069:31:15|T|CMP|I'm not ignoring your - yeah, I'm not ignoring it; I just haven't had a chance to stop and put them on yet. I'll get to it first chance I get.
069:31:22|C|Pet|Roger. That's fine.
069:32:57|T|CDR|Houston; over - this is 16. Over.
069:32:59|C|Pet|Go ahead.
069:33:03|T|CDR|How's your biomed look now?
069:33:08|C|Pet|Stand by a minute. We'll look.
069:33:30|C|Pet|We're still getting a noisy signal on the - on the biomed, 16.
069:35:50|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We're maneuvering to the SIM bay door-jett attitude now.
069:35:54|C|Pet|Roger, copy.
069:36:03|T|CDR|Don, how do you read me now?
069:36:05|C|Pet|Read you loud and clear. We copied your maneuver.
069:36:10|T|CDR|Okay. Roger. I - I had to switch back to the Snoopy hat. That lightweight headset just isn't working out.
069:36:20|C|Pet|Roger.
069:36:21|T|CMP|Okay, we're going through the SIM door-jett checklist, and I've got here a - a list of verifies - I'm on Page 1-7, Step 10 - and it has SM/AC Power On, and - and we haven't been On. With your concurrence, I'll go ahead and turn it on now.
069:36:42|C|Pet|Stand by one.
069:37:23|C|Pet|Okay, Casper, you can go ahead and turn the power On.
069:37:28|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
069:38:20|T|CMP|Houston, I'm ready to put the Pan Camera Power on to Power.
069:38:45|C|Pet|Okay, 16. Stand by a minute.
069:38:56|C|Pet|Casper, we don't have any Pan Camera data yet.
069:39:04|T|CMP|Okay, I haven't put the power On yet. I'm - the checklist says to stand by for MFSN cue. We have the Data System On, the Aux TV is in the SCI, and we have SM/AC Power On. Pan Camera switches are in Standby and Off.
069:39:34|C|Pet|Okay, Casper. You can go ahead and turn the Power On and we'll cue you when you - when to go to Boost.
069:39:47|T|CMP|Okay, Power's coming on on.
069:39:48|T|CMP|Mark. Barber pole's good; back to gray.
069:39:55|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
069:40:19|T|CMP|That's where not having had an opportunity to fly all these things really leaves me uncomfortable.
069:40:25|T|CDR|... here?
069:40:27|T|CMP|Yeah. You know, it's just - like there isn't just - you know, no chance to relax and that's so ...
069:40:31|T|CDR|That's exactly the truth.
069:40:33|T|CMP|Every time you turn around, even if you want to pick your nose, you got to be careful that you do it in the right sequence.
069:40:39|T|CDR|Right ...
069:40:43|T|CMP|Well, I guess I broke the injector into the next ...
069:40:45|T|CDR|Yeah, the injector ...
069:40:49|T|CMP|Well. No. I - I don't think I - I'm not aware of anything I did in that injector that was wrong. I think the capture just broke.
069:40:57|T|CDR|...
069:40:59|T|CMP|But - all the rest of that flapping around was due to my misinterpreting what I saw. I had visions of that nut coming off and filling the ... with water again. Okay.
069:41:05|C|Pet|Okay, Casper. You're Go for Pan Camera to Boost.
069:41:12|T|CMP|Okay.
069:41:12|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Coming up on SIM bay, our Scientific Instrument Module Bay Door Jettison, in about ten minutes - 14 minutes, that is. Present velocity is 3,872 feet [1,180 metres] per second [and] ever increasing, relative to the Moon. The current height altitude 11,618 nautical miles 21,517 kilometres].

Standing by for the SIM bay door jettison.
069:41:17|T|CDR|High Gain angles are Pitch, minus 25; Yaw 307. But we ain't there. Maybe the High Gain ...
069:41:21|T|LMP|... gonna slide right by us or something?
069:41:30|T|CDR|Yeah.
069:41:31|T|LMP|If it gets into red, is it gimbal locked?
069:41:34|T|CDR|Well, it hasn't got a chance yet. Is the SPS gimbal locked, too?
069:41:40|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
069:42:00|T|LMP|I told you wrong.
069:42:03|T|CDR|... Got a Gimbal Lock light ...
069:42:20|T|CMP|Okay. That happens before you get the - your red ball. Because when you hit the red dot, you do coarse align - or the maneuver stops, excuse me. You get this in - about five degrees - about 70 degrees and then 75 degrees, you stop the maneuver. At 85, you coarse align.
069:42:48|T|LMP|How'd you make out?
069:42:50|T|CDR|Just no way.
069:42:52|T|CMP|Okay. Why don't you set these numbers in the GDC?
069:43:00|T|CDR|...
069:43:01|T|CMP|Okay.
069:43:02|T|LMP|... some?
069:43:03|T|CMP|Yeah.
069:43:04|T|CDR|...
069:43:05|T|CMP|Garble] or something ... Co - What is it? Cotangent 90 degrees or something ...
069:43:13|T|CDR|Yeah.
069:43:14|T|CMP|Infinity minus 1. Some such -
069:43:19|T|CDR|Well, we'd better ... -
069:43:20|T|CMP|... Yeah. Okay. How about Fuel Cell Valves - Reactant Valves to Latch. SM/AC Power to Off.
069:43:44|T|CMP|Circuit breaker Logic Power, two, close. Two, close. Logic Power, two, to Jettison. Oh, I'd hate to do this.
069:44:01|T|CDR|Why? Ken - why?
069:44:05|T|LMP|Why?
069:44:07|T|CDR|Afraid you might jettison something besides the door?
069:44:09|T|CMP|No, I want to make sure it doesn't. The momentary switches, unless they got - unless they have solder balls in them, you can't go. That can't go without a solder ball.
069:44:25|T|CDR|Ken, ... one step away from jettison ...
069:44:29|T|CMP|Yeah. I think I'm gonna stop right there - until we get our - until we do those things and actually torque to go for door jett. And all we have to do to jettison the door is - I'll take my Logic Powers to Jettison, and I'll jettison the door, and then we power back down. Be sure we check the propellant to see if we shook any of the - RCSs -
069:44:53|T|CDR|Keep your eye on the Reactant Valves, Ken. You ...
069:44:56|T|CMP|We've got them in Latch -
069:44:59|T|CDR|Keep an eye on them anyhow.
069:45:00|T|CMP|But - anyhow. That's right.
069:45:03|T|CDR|What's the other thing, this talkback?
069:45:04|T|CMP|Okay. These guys won't have talkbacks so we'll have to check these.
069:45:08|T|CDR|... close one.
069:45:10|T|CMP|Yeah. We'll just do that as a matter of course. And that's all here in the checklist. I mean, it's not like - like we'll have to - we'll have to remember these things.
069:45:21|T|CDR|Yeah.
069:45:25|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see, the other thing is the - oxygen and cryo - Oxygen Tank 3 and Hydrogen Tank 3 sit right on top of the Service Module door. So that's a good thing to be monitoring.
069:45:47|T|CDR|Think we ought ...
069:45:59|T|CMP|Okay. Turn the page and we'll see what's coming after this ... Your left one's off. It's moving around ...
069:46:15|T|CDR|Garble] over here ...
069:46:19|T|CMP|Okay. I can do these things while I'm maneuvering. By definition, it's got to be 180 degrees. I've looked at the Flight Plan to check my ... maneuvers. Minimum 180 degrees. Yeah, ... into the computer. Okay. They haven't called up the - Well, I guess - pericynthion - DIUS 2 has the right weight and angles. We ought to get those before we get in there, I guess. Okay, we do this, we get the gyro
069:46:52|T|LMP|...
069:46:54|T|CMP|Yeah. Put - put the Pad in the - in the book.
069:47:01|T|LMP|The Updates Book?
069:47:02|T|CMP|Yeah.
069:47:03|T|LMP|That's what I was gonna do.
069:47:04|T|CMP|It's still in here, too. Just in a useful place. Just. ...
069:47:09|T|CDR|Put that in there, too?
069:47:14|T|CMP|The ... coming up. Let's just put these in here, just in the right place. Yeah, let me get moved up. We got an eat period in there. I'll change my sensors during the eat period ... or something. Somewhere in here, we got to get - the cockpit ... set up for lunar orbit.
069:47:42|T|LMP|Yeah.
069:47:43|T|CMP|Then we'll get out our cameras and all that stuff.
069:47:45|T|CDR|...
069:47:46|T|CMP|Yeah, I will need to use that mag but not until we get some stuff in here, get the booms and the ...
069:47:50|T|LMP|Okay, ...
069:47:52|T|CMP|... me your lens.
069:47:53|T|CDR|Are we using ...?
069:47:55|T|CMP|Doesn't matter ... Got to make a correction - orbital chart; and after that, sports fans, I think we're probably back in business.
069:48:22|T|CDR|Okay. You want to take that door off, that boom off there?
069:48:28|T|CMP|Okay. Do you want to see what kind of thing you've got to do out there? Doesn't look right.
069:48:35|T|CDR|Yeah. Coming down.
069:48:40|T|CMP|Yeah, it does. Okay. You want a - you want a helmet wipe? You want to - I - You want to wipe off all the little windows in the cockpit?
069:48:52|T|CDR|We'll have to do that before we go into lunar orbit.
069:48:56|T|CMP|Just wait and do it then? Do it when - because - ... off one of those visor wipes in just a minute.
069:49:02|T|LMP|I don't ...
069:49:04|T|CMP|I just want something I can clean the windows with. They're sticky. Need a whole bunch of them.
069:49:17|T|LMP|...?
069:49:18|T|CMP|Okay.
069:49:43|T|CMP|There you go.
069:50:02|T|LMP|Okay?
069:50:03|T|CDR|...
069:50:13|T|CDR|You want to take that window right there off ... shade? ...
069:50:23|T|CMP|Charlie, ... by that power cable. These window shades work pretty good, but they still leak. They leak, but they get enough of a seal on them sometimes that it's hard to get ...
069:50:54|T|CDR|...
069:51:02|T|CMP|What - what's wrong with getting a ...
069:51:04|T|CDR|...
069:51:07|T|CMP|Well. No.
069:51:16|T|CDR|Garble]. Call that up. Isn't that what you're gonna do?
069:51:22|T|CMP|Yeah, we're only a couple of minutes late.
069:51:29|T|CDR|Are we?
069:51:31|T|CMP|Aren't we supposed to go at 59?
069:51:34|T|CDR|Yeah ...
069:51:36|T|CMP|Yeah? And maybe they'll ...
069:51:40|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Are we Go for SIM door jettison? Over.
069:51:45|C|Pet|Stand by one.
069:51:52|T|CDR|Okay.
069:51:53|T|CDR|Have you got the Logic Power enabled?
069:51:55|T|CMP|No. I've got them - closed. They can't see it with the ... I'm down to here - three steps from jettison. There's -
069:52:02|C|Pet|16, we're standing by to arm the SM power buses.
069:52:11|T|CMP|Okay, I was going to hold up on that. I'll go ahead and give you a Logic Power to jettison at this time.
069:52:18|C|Pet|Roger.
069:52:26|T|CMP|Here comes Logic Power Jett 1 to Jett and Number 2, Jett.
069:52:36|T|CDR|Okay, they're armed.
069:52:39|C|Pet|Roger; we show them armed.
069:52:49|C|Pet|And we're Go for door jett.
069:52:54|T|CDR|Okay, understand Go for door jett.
069:52:56|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
069:53:01|T|CMP|Okay. And we checked that the cabin regs - emergency regs are set. They're in Both. The surge tank pressure looks good. Does it? Hey, Charlie, watch your ...
069:53:12|T|LMP|Yeah.
069:53:13|T|CMP|... toes ...
069:53:15|T|LMP|Yeah, ... Man, thank you.
069:53:17|T|CMP|(Laughter)
069:53:20|T|LMP|Okay. I'm ready with the camera.
069:53:22|T|CMP|Okay. But really, we're about - 4 minutes out.
069:53:27|T|LMP|Then let's go. Let's go. You have to be right on the second.
069:53:34|T|CMP|Well, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't do it on the second.
069:53:36|T|LMP|Okay. Well, I'll get out of this position then.
069:53:39|T|CMP|I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in - Okay. Surge 3 - surge is good. Hydrogen pressures are good; quantities - there's three ... could be -
069:54:01|T|LMP|Is there any more?
069:54:08|T|CMP|No. That lower trajectory - probably going to have a hard time picking them up initially. You ought to go right out that way. And - there's a little particle that's just floating - look at that little guy just coasting along there, just sitting there.
069:54:33|T|CMP|Okay, repress package is good.
069:54:51|T|CDR|...
069:55:06|T|CMP|Okay, John, if you'll just give me a little countdown at 69:59.
069:55:12|T|CDR|Okay.
069:55:18|T|CMP|Why don't you get the platform ... There we go.
069:55:39|T|CDR|...
069:55:41|T|CMP|Man, I feel like if going to P00 coarse aligned the platform -
069:55:44|T|CDR|Yeah.
069:55:45|T|CMP|(Laughter) You know, the - the most natural thing in the world, the safest operation you can ever think of, is go to P00. And what happens? The platform coarse aligns.
069:55:59|T|LMP|... that attitude ...
069:56:04|T|CMP|But according to my friend Murphy, it will occur just prior to the circ burn, just prior to the TPI ...
069:56:12|T|CDR|... that.
069:56:14|T|CMP|Yeah (laughter).
069:56:17|T|CDR|I didn't realize ... circ burn that ...
069:56:20|T|CMP|Oh, don't tell me. Sounded like they hadn't researched that one this way. Sounded like they'd researched it for the factors ... it's safe, you know, we aren't in ...
069:56:32|T|CDR|Yeah.
069:56:33|T|CMP|But you know what? I believe, just like the - you know, I think that the general attitude that we have seen, a one-in-a-million glitch, is probably quite correct.
069:56:47|T|CDR|... our luck.
069:56:50|T|CMP|(Laughter) We - we uncovered ...
069:56:52|T|CMP|... somebody else's glitch. Well, that's part of the statistics, I guess. One in a million, when you've had yours, don't mean that you ain't gonna get the - that somebody hadn't gone two million hours without a ...
069:57:03|T|CDR|... down there since 1972. Now maybe zero g puts the little things closer to ...
069:57:12|T|CMP|Yeah, maybe. There's so many subtleties to this program we ain't figured out yet. Lot of ... very subtle things. That's why ... glitches. I'm just amazed that we worried about anything happening.
069:57:20|T|CDR|Yeah, that's amazing ... It's really ... Okay. A minute and 15.
069:57:48|T|CMP|You notice, that signal strength doesn't stay as high as I thought it would, do you think? Has it ever come up full on the High Gain, Charlie? Or is that as high as it's gotten?
069:57:57|T|LMP|....
069:58:05|T|CMP|Okay. It's up on a minute. Give me a call at 30 seconds.
069:58:17|T|CDR|Okay.
069:58:32|T|CDR|Thirty seconds to door jett.
069:58:35|C|Pet|Roger; 30 seconds.
069:58:34|T|CMP|Thank you. I've got the switch guard up.
069:58:44|T|CDR|I'll count you down from ten.
069:58:45|T|CMP|All right.
069:58:53|T|CDR|10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
069:59:01|T|CDR|Jett.
069:59:02|T|LMP|Man alive!
069:59:03|T|CDR|There it goes!
069:59:02|T|CDR|Jett. There it goes.
069:59:04|T|LMP|Beautiful. Beautiful!
069:59:05|C|Pet|Roger.
069:59:06|T|CMP|Can you see it?
069:59:07|T|LMP|Yes, sir. Just great.
069:59:08|T|CDR|Okay. Reac valves, you guys.
069:59:10|T|CMP|Reacs - they're good.
069:59:14|T|CDR|Okay, the door went, and I don't think anything changed much from what we could tell.
069:59:18|T|LMP|It was a big bang. Look at it spinning around in there. See it, Ken?
069:59:21|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
069:59:24|T|CMP|Yeah.
069:59:25|T|CDR|Can you see it?
069:59:26|T|LMP|Yeah. Sure is beautiful.
069:59:28|T|CDR|Oh. Yeah. You can see it out this window, too. Give me the camera quick. I think I can -
069:59:32|T|CMP|Oh.
069:59:33|T|LMP|I got it right in the middle of the -
069:59:34|T|CDR|You got it? Okay. That's beautiful.
069:59:39|T|CMP|Yeah. There's the satellite and everything. (Laughter) Probably shouldn't tell them that. That'll scare them. That'll - that'll upset them.

069:59:48|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, we can watch it spinning around, out both the center window and Charlie's window, and it's ...
069:59:53|T|LMP|Okay. Cameras ...
069:59:54|T|CDR|... quite a sight. Every time it comes around the bright side, the bright side front really flashes.
069:59:58|T|LMP|Let's go over the checklist.
069:59:59|T|CMP|I am. Logic Power, two, Off. SM/AC Power coming on. Fuel Cell Reactant Valves to Normal.
070:00:00|C|Pet|Roger.
070:00:13|T|LMP|Normal. Go on.
070:00:15|T|CMP|Service Module RCS Propellant talkbacks, eight, gray.
070:00:17|T|LMP|They are all gray. Are we gonna ...?
070:00:22|T|CDR|He already did.
070:00:24|T|CMP|Helium talkbacks, eight, gray?
070:00:25|T|CDR|Go.
070:00:30|T|CMP|We got the Secondaries, Closed?
070:00:31|T|CDR|Yeah.
070:00:32|T|CMP|Self Test to Heaters. Excuse me, Charlie.
070:00:36|T|LMP|Sure.
070:00:39|T|CDR|... lose something ...
070:00:43|T|CMP|... When you find it floating around, I think you'll ... might not even get it.

070:00:55|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, that was a pretty good bang.
070:00:59|C|Pet|Roger.
070:01:01|T|CDR|The reason it was is on account of we're standing around here in our underwear, you know. That is, helmets and gloves off.
070:01:10|C|Pet|Roger; copied that.
070:01:12|T|LMP|And - I guess the - the sound - the sound of it was about half of what you hear when the - when you're in the LM and - and the CMP's in here and he hears the pressure reg - the pressure release valve closing on him.
070:01:32|C|Pet|Roger.
070:01:35|T|LMP|The cabin repress valve, that is.
070:01:42|T|CMP|Okay, Don. All of the SIM bay configurations have been completed if you want to take a look at the data and see if there is anything that looks funny to you, I can recheck it.
070:01:52|C|Pet|Okay, Casper. Stand by one and we'll take a look.
070:02:39|T|LMP|Okay, and we're going to P52 attitude now.
070:02:44|C|Pet|Roger; copy. P52 attitude.
070:03:26|T|LMP|Okay, the door has rapidly receded from us, and it's certainly hard to tell how far away it is, but it's plenty far away; certainly no recontact problem.
070:03:38|C|Pet|Roger; copied. And, Casper, the SIM bay looks okay.
070:03:47|T|CMP|Roger; thank you.
070:03:49|T|CDR|That's a good start. And, we used only about 15 percent; we're reading magazine BB, 85 percent remaining.
070:03:58|C|Pet|Magazine BB, 85 percent.
070:09:02|T|CMP|Houston, 16. Our LM/CM Delta-P is 0.2 and the pressure equalization valve is open. Our cryo systems are configured.
070:09:11|C|Pet|Roger; copied. LM/CM Delta-P, 0.2.
070:24:59|C|Pet|16, we've got an LOI preliminary PAD and, if you'll go Accept, we'll up-link data.

070:26:03|T|LMP|Houston, 16. Go ahead with your PAD.

070:29:18|C|Pet|Roger; that's adjusted correct.
070:29:37|C|Pet|16, you can have the computer and back to Block.
070:29:47|T|LMP|Back - back to Block, Houston.
070:29:52|C|Pet|Roger.
070:31:13|C|Pet|And, Casper; Houston. We haven't forgotten your question about what happens if the glitch occurs while Average g is running. We're still putting together a nice neat summary for you; we'll come up with it a little later.
070:31:31|T|CDR|Okay, and I guess it's to tell us what the residuals are doing more than anything else and we'd like to know that.
070:31:38|C|Pet|Okay.
070:32:32|C|Pet|16, we're still seeing intermittent data which indicates that one biomed sensor is probably loose on the CMP.
070:32:48|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. You've been looking at John's biomed; Ken's getting suited up right now with his.
070:32:58|T|CDR|Okay, which one is it, ZPN or heart rate? Over.
070:33:03|C|Pet|It's EKG, John.
070:33:15|C|Pet|16, you can terminate Battery A charge.
070:33:24|T|LMP|Okay.
070:45:41|T|CDR|Houston, Apollo 16. Over.
070:45:43|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
070:45:48|T|CDR|Okay, in a minute and 40 seconds, the bias went from 100 to 101.1.
070:46:00|C|Pet|Roger; we copy and -
070:46:01|T|CDR|... a hundred.
070:46:02|C|Pet|The G&amp;C says that's okay.

070:54:46|T|CDR|Houston, let me read you a note I found in the Flight Plan here right at 38 hours. Over.
070:54:53|C|Pet|At 38 hours?
070:54:58|T|CDR|That's affirmative. I woke up after the first night and I find this note in here from Ken. It says: 'John' - says - 'We have had some sort of IMU or CMC hardware problem. Right after you went to sleep at 38 hours, the platform coarse aligned itself; we got it back with an Earth/Sun alignment. Fortunately, MCC had high belt [sic] rate all the time and we'll work it out tomorrow. Sleep tight.' Signed, TK (laughter). And I got up the next morning and I saw that in there, and I said, 'Boy, that Ken's sure got a funny sense of humor.'
070:55:37|C|Pet|Yeah, I - I guess we would concur with that funny sense of humor. We had some guys here laugh all night.
070:55:50|T|CDR|Yeah, I (laughter) I guess I didn't believe the note (laughter).
070:55:56|C|Pet|I - I can understand that.
070:58:35|T|CMP|Hello, Donald. Are you still there?
070:58:37|C|Pet|Affirmative, still with you.
070:58:43|T|CMP|Okay, you want to have them take a look at the biomed data?
070:58:52|C|Pet|Roger, Ken. We're doing that now.
070:59:13|C|Pet|16, it looks like the SIM Bay temps are coming up a little. We may have to change our roll angle. We'll come up with an angle for you in just a minute.
070:59:24|T|CMP|Okay.
070:59:25|C|Pet|And the biomed - med data looks good now.
070:59:31|T|CMP|All right, sir. And just as a curiosity item, you might note that it takes - with two of us working on putting those things on, it took us 15 minutes to put the data on and get hooked up. And I guess by yourself, it takes about 20 because you've got to use a mirror to see some of that.
070:59:49|C|Pet|Roger.
071:00:16|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We want you to go to a Roll of 020 with the same Pitch and Yaw angles that you have now. And you should be able to do the P52 in the new attitude, and the High Gain should stay locked up.
071:00:34|T|CMP|Roger.
071:01:07|T|CMP|Okay, ...
071:05:53|T|CDR|Delta ... 59 ...
071:06:00|C|Pet|16, you're very, very weak. Say again.
071:06:12|T|CDR|I said, we're there. I guess your temps will be stabilizing now.
071:06:18|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
071:03:48|T|CMP|Don, how about if we go ahead and do our P52s now?
071:08:55|C|Pet|Okay. Go ahead, Ken.
071:09:00|T|CMP|All righty, thank you.
071:11:06|C|Pet|Casper, would you verify that you are gonna load the - the DAP and then the EMP 509 before you do the P52?.
071:11:16|T|CMP|That's in work right now.
071:11:19|C|Pet|Roger. Thank you.
071:11:29|T|CMP|Yeah, I guess you saw us get out of sequence there a little, but we're - we're back on now.
071:11:34|C|Pet|Roger. We understand.
071:13:29|C|Pet|Casper, hold up on your procedure there a minute.
071:13:35|T|CMP|Okay; holding. You're pretty good. You stopped old Casper in midpunch.
071:14:32|C|Pet|Casper, apparently it's necessary to load the normal DAP before you load the EMP, because once you've loaded the Saturn DAP, the LM weight and that sort of thing will not be accepted by the CMC. So we'd like to have you take the EMP out, load the normal DAP, and then load the EMP back in. We should of told you about that earlier, I guess. It slipped by.
071:15:08|T|CMP|Well, that's okay. I stopped and wondered about it, and then I decided I couldn't think of any reason why it wouldn't work the way we did it. Okay, we're back in sync now. Now we can start with 509. Is that affirmative?
071:15:20|C|Pet|You've loaded the - the normal DAP now?
071:15:29|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
071:15:33|C|Pet|Stand by just a minute. We're looking at it.
071:15:45|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. It looks real good, and you can go ahead now with the EMP and the P52.
071:15:54|T|CMP|Okay, will do. I kind of like this attitude you picked, Don. It's got the old Earth in the telescope.
071:16:02|C|Pet|Hey, wonderful -
071:16:03|T|CMP|... pretty.
071:16:06|C|Pet|Plot board says you should be just about over Africa -
071:16:08|T|CMP|- ... picked this attitude for aesthetic reasons. Well, it's orange. I guess that - that's sort of saying something.
071:16:20|C|Pet|Right.
071:18:10|T|CMP|Don, would you ask the guidance guys to take a look at ... I'm sure it's a typical thing, I just never noticed. I was watching the optics zero the other night, and using 1691 as the way to do that. And here again I - I watched it, and at the completion of the zero, it looks like it went to - the Register 2 display now, and I'm still in zero. I just thought that was kind of curious. Is that a bit size or something?
071:18:40|C|Pet|Stand by one. We'll look at it.
071:18:56|T|CMP|I've taken it out of Zero now. That's why it's counting. Then we'll go ahead with the 52.
071:18:58|C|Pet|I understand you're taking it out of Zero now.
071:19:03|T|CMP|It was out of Zero when it started counting. It went from 403 up to what you see now.
071:19:09|C|Pet|Roger.
071:19:10|T|CMP|And that's due to trunnion trip.
071:19:15|C|Pet|Roger.
071:22:23|T|CMP|Don, is there any reason to torque these since we're getting ready to go to an option one?
071:22:27|C|Pet|Stand by a minute.
071:22:34|C|Pet|Go ahead and torque them. And, Ken, could you check your - your mike placement? You're very, very weak.
071:22:59|T|CMP|Okay, Don. Is that any better?
071:23:01|C|Pet|Yes, that's some better, Ken. Thank you.
071:23:07|T|CMP|And we'll torque them at 23:10.
071:23:10|C|Pet|Roger.
071:31:30|T|CMP|Don, just out of more academic interest, it turns out that the pea [?] packs and the - and the Noun 91s are exactly the same.
071:31:40|C|Pet|Roger; understand.
071:32:10|T|CMP|Yeah, Don, what I was gonna say is that the - the peapacks [?] on the shaft are within - yeah - the readability of the DSKY. The trunnion then seems to be off by about 2/100, which I think is a pretty fine agreement. And for the interest of some of those people who are talking about these optics and whether they drift or not, if you can watch 1691 right now, you'll find that I'm in - the Mode is Manual and I'm in Direct, and you can watch them drift slowly. And at low rate, I'll go to Resolve, and they drift at approximately the same rate. There seemed to be some question about that earlier. I thought - some of the guys in the back might be interested in that.
071:33:02|C|Pet|Roger. Copy. Thank you.
071:33:32|C|Pet|Okay, Casper, for your information, although we had you going ahead and load EMP 509 prior to the P52, it was not absolutely necessary at that point because you did this P52 under SCS control. And anytime you're under SCS control, that TVC relay is not enabled. So you really don't have the problem. There's no way that glitch can get to you. But we wanted - we had to have the EMP 509 loaded eventually, so we figured we'd go ahead and let you get it in now.
071:34:07|T|CMP|Okay. I understand that, and thank you very much.
071:34:14|C|Pet|Roger.
071:34:15|T|CMP|And with all this stuff over the next few days, it wouldn't hurt to keep a list of those things down there and connect - and kind of stay with me on those things to be sure I don't get one of them out of sync.
071:34:28|C|Pet|Roger. We'll follow you.
071:46:22|C|Pet|Casper, Houston. When you get a few minutes to talk, we've got a little philosophy - philosophy on the use of the EMP 509 in lunar orbit.
071:46:48|T|LMP|Okay, can you stand by just a minute, please?
071:46:50|C|Pet|Roger. Will do.
071:46:52|T|LMP|Pete, we moved the eat period up a little bit. We're getting all the food ready here.
071:46:58|C|Pet|Roger. This can stand by for quite a while.
071:47:07|T|CMP|Okay, I'll come back to you in about ten minutes with all that.
071:47:09|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. Good enough; thank you.
071:54:23|T|CMP|Okay, Don. I'm - I got some free hands now, and got my little note pad out, and I'm ready to listen and copy and discuss anything you got on this stuff.
071:54:31|C|Pet|Okay. I guess, Ken, the first thing we'll talk about is the use of the EMP in lunar orbit, that is when you're - when you're alone in the spacecraft. We - we do not plan to run EMP 509 continuously, primarily because if you do, you don't have gimbal lock through gimbal lock protection. What we will do is we will run it during programs that involve TVC enable relay cycling, except for P52. Now, that means that we will run it for SPS burns, and you already have the procedures for LOI and DOI, and for other burns. The procedures will stay the same except that we may change the time sequences for doing some of the items. We will also run the EMP 509 for P24 and for rendezvous, and we're having MIT verify that compatibility at the present time. We'll come back to you on those with more details later. And during P52 with the P20 option 5, our current procedures call for going CMC, Free. Instead of doing that, what we'll do is we'll go to this Spacecraft Control, SCS; put the Rate switch High; and BMAG Mode, Rate 2. And that way, the rate damping level is below your orb rate, and so your SCS, as far as control is concerned, will be equivalent to CMC, Free. However, by going to SCS control, if you want to check back on that list of set and reset conditions, you'll find that by going to SCS control, we eliminate the possibility of getting this glitch.
071:56:43|T|CMP|Okay; would you say again how we're gonna handle P - nominally P20 option 5; we will not use 509. Is that correct?
071:56:55|C|Pet|That's affirmative. We will not use 509 during P20 option 5.
071:57:03|T|CMP|Okay. And when we come to do a P52, we will still not use the option - the 509 - we're gonna go to SCS control and use Rate High and Max Deadband. Is that correct?
071:57:23|C|Pet|Okay; Rate High and Max Deadband is okay, but G&amp;C tells me you really - that the Deadband - you don't need to go to Max, it's - it's kind of immaterial which position you put the switch in. You do need the Rate switch in High, and you need BMAG Mode, Rate 2. That way you don't have an attitude control situation. You have a rate control situation, but the level is high enough that it's well above the orb rate, and so the SCS will be equivalent to going CMC, Free.
071:58:02|T|CMP|Okay; I understand that. Thank you.
071:58:03|C|Pet|Okeydoke; and -
071:58:04|T|CMP|I'll leave it in Deadband and Rate, High.
071:58:06|C|Pet|Roger. And we'll get more details to you later on the P24 and the rendezvous.
071:58:17|T|CMP|Okay. Doing good work.
071:58:37|C|Pet|Ken, there's one other comment here. If you are gonna, at some point in lunar orbit, do quite a bit of Optics switching, like Manual and Automatic and that sort of thing, we would suggest in that case that you load EMP 509 before you start playing with the optics and take it out again when you're finished.
071:58:55|T|CMP|Okay; any time we're doing that - I assume that means like in - when we're doing the landmark tracking, both High and Low, and it's my understanding from the comments we got now that the only time 509 can get me in trouble is if I leave it enabled during thrusting.
071:59:21|C|Pet|That in general is -
071:59:22|T|CMP|- and also ... the automatic gimbal stop.
071:59:26|C|Pet|That's absolutely correct, Ken. Those are the two cases.
071:59:30|T|CMP|All right, sir. Thank you very much. Hey, you might tell Tom Holloway that his little note pad has really come in handy. That's super.
071:59:40|C|Pet|He's sitting here smiling and giving me the thumbs up right now.
072:00:10|T|CMP|Charlie just asked that everybody lock the doors until he finds his pea soup.

072:13:26|C|Pet|Roger. We understand. We were just sitting here enjoying some of the beauties of Earth ourselves.
072:13:37|T|CDR|Somebody new serving coffee, huh?
072:13:42|C|Pet|That's affirmative.

072:13:59|C|Pet|We'll have to get you a count, but Jerry says it's a new record.
072:30:12|C|Pet|16 - 16, Houston. I've got a map update, Rev 1. It's at about 73:20 in the Flight Plan, and also I've got some answers to Ken's earlier question about this glitch and what if it occurs following a burn.
072:30:34|T|CMP|Go ahead.
072:30:37|C|Pet|Okay. Map update, Rev 1. LOS: 074:17:41; 180 degrees: 074:31:39. AOS with LOI: 074:50:05; without LOI: 074:42:08.
072:31:10|T|CMP|Okay; 074:17:41; 074:31:39; 074:50:05; 074:42:08.
072:31:25|C|Pet|That's affirmative. Okay. Now, Ken, on this other question. As we understood your question, you're concerned about what happens after - at 2.5 seconds after the burn when you switch back to the RCS DAP and cycle this relay. What happens if you get the glitch, and it looks like there are two cases. Either you get a - a yaw glitch of sufficient magnitude to put you into coarse align, or you get some kind of glitch that could be in roll, pitch, or yaw but does not put you into coarse align. If you go into coarse align, the nav is no good, and the Noun 85s are no good, and in that case, we'd like you to exit Average g as soon as possible by - by exiting the program. If you're not in coarse align, the nav is good, but the Noun 85s are still no good.
072:32:37|T|CMP|Okay. Okay. We've got you.
072:32:42|C|Pet|Roger.
072:32:45|T|CMP|Particularly in LOI, since there's no trim; that's only a problem for - for recording purposes anyhow.
072:32:53|C|Pet|Roger. That's correct.
072:32:57|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much.
072:39:32|C|Pet|16, Houston. I've get three items to go in the Flight Plan. At about 79:29 is the first one, and if we can get these in, that will finish up the Flight Plan updates for today.
072:39:49|T|CMP|Okay. Press on.
072:39:51|C|Pet|Okay. At 79:29 right at the bottom of the page there, we want to add "Load 509," and at 79:3 -
072:40:07|T|CMP|- ... behind "Load Noun 89.
072:40:12|C|Pet|That's affirmative. After. It should follow the "Load Noun 89.
072:40:23|T|CMP|Okay. I've added "Load 509" after "Load Noun 89.
072:40:29|C|Pet|That's affirmative. And at 79:38, we want to delete the Verb 48 there, and thats not associated with the 509. That's simply because that's redundant. You're already in that DAP configuration.
072:40:51|T|CMP|Okay.
072:40:53|C|Pet|And at - 79:42 right after the MSFN update block there, add "Terminate EMP 509 after P24 completed.
072:41:19|T|CMP|Okay "Terminate 509 after P24 completed." Now let me - Is that the last one or you got some more?
072:41:26|C|Pet|That's all of them.
072:41:30|T|CMP|Okay. Let me read them back to you where I've got them to make sure I have it all right. At about 79:29-1/2 on the page, I've written "Load 509." I have deleted the Verb 48 which occurs at 79:38; and 79:41 - 42, I've got "Terminate 509 after P24 is completed.
072:41:55|C|Pet|That's correct, Ken.
072:41:59|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
072:42:19|T|CMP|And, Don, on this first rev, if we wanted to take some pictures or something, can we stick with magazine November November? I can't tell right now what that's scheduled for. Or should we use magazine Victor?
072:42:38|C|Pet|Stand by. We'll let you know.
072:42:42|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
072:44:38|C|Pet|Casper, November November looks pretty low on the Pad. You should get a magazine Victor.
072:44:48|T|LMP|Thank you.
072:44:50|T|CMP|Okay. Thanks.
072:48:16|C|Pet|16, Houston. We've got a couple more words on the LM paint-peeling problem. Apparently, it has been duplicated now in a vacuum chamber, and it does not appear to be any kind of a problem as far as the mission is concerned.
072:48:37|T|CMP|Well, that's fine to hear. Thank you now.
072:48:40|C|Pet|Roger. It's nothing leaking; it's just the paint itself.
072:48:48|T|CMP|Okay.
072:52:10|T|CDR|Don, we're getting ready to start into the secondary glycol loop check.
072:52:19|C|Pet|Okay. We're ready to follow.

072:53:45|T|CDR|Pump AC1's on the Secondary Loop.
072:53:49|C|Pet|Roger.
072:54:27|T|CDR|Okay. And we see the outlet temperature decreasing.
072:54:29|C|Pet|Roger.
072:56:28|T|CMP|Houston, 16. Are y'all satisfied with the nitrogen pressures on the SPS?
072:56:34|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
072:56:41|T|CMP|Thank you.
072:58:57|T|CMP|Houston, LM/CM Delta-P is 0.2 again.
072:59:04|C|Pet|Roger. LM/CM Delta-P, 0.2.
073:02:23|T|CDR|Houston, I just got my head unlocked and wiggled it out of window Number 1, and we have a half-Moon in Earthshine. It is really pretty.
073:02:36|C|Pet|Roger.
073:02:38|T|CDR|Got so many ... You can see all the - you know, you can see all the prominent features and little sharp craters like - I think I'm looking at Kepler. It's out there in the middle of the mare. It's just beautiful. And that's all Earthshine.
073:02:53|C|Pet|Roger.
073:02:56|T|CDR|Yes, and it's just about - it's like two-thirds of the window, if I've got my hand no more than 6 inches from it. You know, on the - on the dark side, you can see a big dark disk, and I think the reason I can see it is it's the solar corona that's illuminating around the back side. And I can see a star within - well, maybe it's within a degree of the Moon's disk.
073:03:26|C|Pet|Roger.
073:04:21|C|Pet|Could we get the Duke to confirm that that's really the Moon and not the Earth you're looking at?
073:04:28|T|LMP|Hey, babe, this is really the Moon. It's the most awe-inspiring sight I've ever seen in my life. Looks like the door that just hung out there in the middle of blackness. It's really beautiful, Pete.
073:04:42|C|Pet|Roger.
073:04:43|T|CMP|And you can make out all the features on the thing. I can see ..., and you can see up into the Procellarum - and in the basins in there. You can even see the outer rings of Orientale. And you can't see the basin itself but you can see it's outer rings.
073:05:07|C|Pet|Sounds beautiful, Ken.
073:05:13|T|CMP|And looking at our present orientation, I can tell that our new attitude will be perfect for LOI.
073:05:29|C|Pet|Roger.
073:06:57|C|Pet|Ken, just for your information - The reading that you got when you zeroed the optics on the Noun 91s there was considered normal, and it's like a single-bit - or less than a single-bit error. And the other thing I wanted to pass on was that this. EMP 509 has been verified by MIT for use with P24 and during rendezvous.
073:07:26|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
073:07:26|||<p class="tech"><b>073 0T 50 Mattingly:</b> Don, we're gonna waste the two frames of VHBW. Could you tell me if it's better to - to use SS or TT?

073:11:40|C|Pet|Stand by a minute.
073:11:57|T|CMP|Was that affirmative or negative? Over.
073:11:59|C|Pet|Stand by one.
073:12:06|C|Pet|16, give us P00 and Accept, and we'll give you your up-links, and then you can maneuver.
073:12:18|T|CMP|P00 and Accept.
073:12:20|C|Pet|Roger.
073:14:08|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. The reason we would like to go now is it looks to me like you can't get there without going through gimbal lock, but we want to see what the DAP wants us to do.
073:14:17|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
073:15:12|C|Pet|Okay, 16. You can start maneuvering, and we'll help you watch the gimbal lock situation, and also, I have an LOI pad when - whenever you're ready to copy.

|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. [The] Apollo 16 spacecraft has passed behind the Moon two seconds early according to the Loss of Signal clock in the Control Center here. To review some of the upcoming numbers with the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver, ignition time will be at 74:28 - 74 hours, 28 minutes, 27 seconds Ground Elapsed Time - about ten minutes from now. The total Delta-V, or velocity change, will be 2,802 feet [854 metres] per seconds - feet per second in retrograde. Apollo 16, at the end of the burn will be in a lunar orbit measuring 58.3 nautical miles pericynthion [108 kilometres] and 170 nautical miles [315 kilometres] in apocynthion. Total burn time with the 2,000 pound thrust - 20,000 pound [89,000 Newtons] thrust Service Propulsion System engine will be six minutes, 14 seconds. With a successful Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, the spacecraft will be acquired again by the Manned Spaceflight Tracking Network at a Ground Elapsed Time of 74 hours, 50 minutes, 5 seconds, but in the remote chance that there is not a burn - no ignition for some reason - the time without a burn would be 74 hours, 42 minutes, eight seconds. The estimated impact time for the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V, which propelled Apollo 16 on the way to the Moon. That impact time now is 75 hours, 7 [minutes], 3 [seconds] and because of no tracking available over the last day or two, this is an estimate based on last predictions. It will not be within the field of view of the spacecraft even though they will be coming around the front side of the Moon at that time; it will be over the spacecraft's horizon. The seismometers from the earlier Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages left on the Moon by earlier missions will be monitored to detect the S-IVB impact, which is equivalent to about 11 tons of TNT. Some 29 minutes away from Acquisition Of Signal - assuming a nominal Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, and 17 seconds away from ignition on Lunar Orbit Insertion. Come back up again prior to AOS, or acquisition of Apollo 16, as it comes around the east side of the Moon.

074:24:29|T|CDR|What's that?
074:24:30|T|CMP|That guy had died. My nose ain't that stopped up. All that goes through is the odors, no oxygen.

074:28:38|T|CDR|Where?
074:28:40|T|CMP|Pressure is 90 on the gage.
074:28:42|T|LMP|Pressure's looking great here. Helium valves are open. PUGS is looking good.
074:28:50|T|CMP|I can feel that sucker bring that second bank on.
074:28:54|T|CDR|Yeah, I felt that, too.
074:28:56|T|LMP|Okay. We - I see it in the reflection in the LM windows.
074:29:00|T|CDR|Keep your eye on them, babe.
074:29:04|T|LMP|I am. I got them, babe.
074:29:03|T|CMP|What was the alarm at the start?
074:29:04|T|LMP|It went out, whatever it was. I think it was a overpressure on the SPS; now it's back nominal.
074:29:09|T|CMP|Okay.
074:29:12|T|LMP|Okay, fuel's running a little low. It's running about 165. Coming up on a minute.

074:29:29|T|LMP|Mark, one minute.
074:29:31|T|CMP|Okay. Doesn't register on the g meter (laughter). Okay, gimbals are still steady.

074:29:42|T|LMP|Mark. Loose limit.
074:29:46|T|CDR|...
074:29:50|T|CMP|Chamber pressure's going up a little.
074:29:56|T|CDR|...
074:29:58|T|CMP|Yeah, I gave you bum dope. I was calling that 90, but it was 95.
074:30:01|T|CDR|Son of a gun.
074:30:02|T|CMP|Inside.
074:30:03|T|CDR|Inside.
074:30:05|T|LMP|... 130.
074:30:06|T|CMP|That's really 96 psi on the chamber pressure.
074:30:11|T|LMP|PUGS is looking great.
074:30:12|T|CMP|Attitudes are holding. How do the two Delta-Vs compare, John?
074:30:18|T|CDR|Delta-Vs compare pretty close, as matter of fact.
074:30:21|T|CMP|Measurables ... I mean, to go.
074:30:23|T|CDR|Yeah, yeah.
074:30:25|T|CMP|About ten.
074:30:26|T|CDR|Yeah, ten apart. Lot closer than in the simulator.
074:30:29|T|CMP|... Okay.
074:30:30|T|LMP|Mark, two minutes.
074:30:31|T|CDR|...

074:30:49|T|CMP|BMAGs look good.
074:30:50|T|LMP|Four - about 04:15.
074:30:51|T|CMP|Four - yeah. 04;30.
074:30:52|T|LMP|04:20, actually.
074:30:53|T|CDR|Yeah. You're gonna make me nervous ...
074:30:57|T|CMP|When I say what?
074:30:59|T|LMP|Mark; 02:30.
074:31:01|T|CDR|Okay.
074:31:05|T|CMP|... -
074:31:06|T|LMP|CMC's right on, with my time. PUGS is about 100, unbalanced, and holding. Decrease.
074:31:21|T|CDR|... Looks like it's working, doesn't it?
074:31:22|T|CMP|Man, it sure does.
074:31:24|T|LMP|Okay, coming up on 3 minutes -
074:31:25|T|CMP|... (laughter). Chamber pressure -
074:31:29|T|LMP|Mark.
074:31:30|T|CMP|- 78.
074:31:31|T|LMP|Okay, we got 150 on the PUGS, unbalanced, decrease.
074:31:34|T|CMP|Okay. Don says that if we watch it go, it'll go down to about - almost 200 and then work its way back up.
074:31:40|T|LMP|Okay.
074:31:43|T|CDR|Okay. Three minutes. Right on time.
074:31:47|T|CMP|Man, that thing is - their prediction is right on this.
074:31:50|T|CDR|Yeah.
074:31:51|T|CMP|Isn't that beautiful?
074:31:52|T|LMP|... heard of it.
074:31:53|T|CDR|...
074:31:54|T|LMP|Okay, coming up on 03:30.
074:31:56|T|CDR|EMS and the Delta-V to go are right together. Perfect.
074:31:59|T|LMP|Mark; 03:30.
074:32:02|T|CMP|Chamber pressure's at 98.
074:32:06|T|LMP|Stand by for the tight limits -
074:32:07|T|LMP|Mark. Tight limits. We're at 200; unbalanced; jiggling around a little bit; decrease.
074:32:20|T|CMP|Okay, ...
074:32:23|T|LMP|Coming up on 4 minutes. SPS pressures are rock solid.
074:32:29|T|LMP|Mark; 4 minutes.
074:32:31|T|CMP|Inside (laughter).
074:32:32|T|LMP|I'm not, I'm looking at the gages. I was having a little bias back there. Okay?
074:32:39|T|CDR|Okay, and now for ...
074:32:40|T|LMP|Stand by for crossover.
074:32:43|T|CDR|EMS and this thing are right together. Couldn't be any closer.
074:32:47|T|LMP|It looks like we've had crossover.
074:32:49|T|CMP|Okay. My chamber pressure very smoothly increased to 100.
074:32:53|T|LMP|Okay, and the unbalance went a back - that's jiggling around on zero. Stand by.
074:32:59|T|LMP|Mark; 04:30.
074:33:05|T|CMP|Man, that mental machine.
074:33:07|T|CDR|Keep doing it, machine.

074:51:10|T|CDR|Hello, Houston. Sweet 16 has arrived.
074:51:14|C|Pet|Roger, 16. Copy you loud and clear.
074:51:20|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. Super double fantastic burn. If you're ready, I'll give you a burn status report.
074:51:31|C|Pet|Okay, go ahead, John.
074:51:34|T|LMP|Okay, Delta-T. was 0615 burn - 06:15.1 burn time, plus 2803.9, trim ...; residuals, plus 0.2, minus zero, minus 0.1. Delta-V<sub>C</sub> is minus 5.5; fuel, 376, Ox, 371; 150, unbalance, decrease. Okay, at ignition, we got a momentary SPS light; then it went out. During the burn, the Oxidizer pressure read 200. The Fuel side was a little bit low, and it was about 165 on my gage. After shutdown, the Fuel side climbed to 170. The Oxidizer went to about 202 with an SPS light, and we've still got it. Over.
074:52:33|C|Pet|Roger. We copied everything except the roll, pitch, and yaw, which was blacked out by some noise.
074:52:41|T|LMP|Okay, the trim attitude - we did not trim. The residuals were as we gave you after the burn. Our attitude was 005, 358, 002. Over.
074:52:53|C|Pet|Roger. We copy.
074:53:01|T|CDR|And it was a slight transient, when the second bank was lit, that I don't remember from previous burns. You might look at that data, but it was super.
074:53:13|C|Pet|Roger. Copy.
074:53:14|T|CMP|And it appeared to me that the chamber pressure had dropped off just as we brought the second bank on.
074:53:25|T|CDR|And as you can see, we're in 170.4 by 58.3 [nautical miles - 315.6 by 108 kilometres] according to the old computer, and that baby just rifled it right down the line.
074:53:36|C|Pet|All righty.
074:53:37|T|CDR|Everybody is looking out their window. And right now, we're looking right down at Crater King, and it's just as fantastic as it always has been.
074:53:48|C|Pet|Roger.
074:53:49|T|CDR|You can see those little dark - those little dark - look like volcanic black spots up - up in the north sector of it, and you can see the central peaks with a - with a varied - very white central peaks covered by lighter gray - gray-brown material that sort of looked like somebody painted it on there with a - with a - with a paintbrush.
074:54:39|T|CMP|And, Pete, your first view at Tsiolkovsky out of my window is pretty - it's a spectacular sight the way that - looks like a marshmallow float - a central peak floating in the top of a hot chocolate.
074:54:55|T|CDR|Yeah, you - it - it's like - three guys - they've each got a window, and we're staring at - at the ground. It's really - Boy, this has got to be the neatest way to make a living anybody's ever invented.
074:56:20|T|LMP|Pete, 16 here. Another pretty sight we had before burn was the earthset. It - really quite a view.
074:56:33|C|Pet|We're all sitting here listening, Charlie. Tell us about it.
074:57:14|T|LMP|Pete, you got - a - Mapping - or the Pan Camera Power's - is on?
074:57:21|C|Pet|Okay, Pan Camera Power on.
074:58:00|T|CDR|How'd the S-IVB look?
074:58:07|C|Pet|It hasn't happened yet, John. It's about another - nine minutes or so.
074:58:25|T|CDR|I - I trust we're not getting there the same time it does.
074:58:29|C|Pet|I trust.
074:58:33|T|CDR|Okay.
074:59:41|C|Pet|It - it's going to hit on the southwest corner of Reinhold, Ken.
074:59:46|T|CDR|Say again, Pete.
074:59:47|C|Pet|Tell Ken it's going to hit on the southwest corner of Reinhold. He should know where that is.
074:59:55|T|CDR|I'm sure he does.
074:59:58|T|CMP|Okay. Let me get the binoculars out here - playing with them there. It's pretty interesting. I tell you, all that time spent with Farouk sure really's going to pay off, because it does look like old home.
075:00:15|C|Pet|That's good, Ken.

075:03:21|T|LMP|Pete, looking out at the horizon, you can really tell you're in the highlands. The horizon is really jagged looking.
075:03:31|C|Pet|Looks like coming up on the Rockies, huh?
075:03:34|T|CDR|Of course, we're start - we're starting to come up over the flatlands now, over the Smyth Sea. I remember a landmarking track down there on Apollo 10. It's still there. You can't really tell by looking at it that the Smyth Sea is any - any deeper or lower than the data shows it is right in the surrounding terrain.
075:03:59|C|Pet|Roger.
075:06:17|T|CDR|The submerged craters in Smythii remind me a lot of a- coral atolls. They just got the ridges sticking up, you know, and the - and the bottoms of them appear to be flooded with the same material that's in Smyth.
075:06:40|C|Pet|We're digging out a map now, 16, to take a look at it.
075:07:42|T|CDR|We're going to get a close-in picture of Humboldt here, as we come up, because we'll probably miss it on the next round.
075:07:49|C|Pet|Roger.
075:08:04|T|CDR|That's real - it's really a fascinating crater, the way the dark mare has got in - sort of like a path around the edges, and - and there's a fracture pattern running across it, and it has some very prominent central peaks that are very white. But it has every contrast and color on the Moon.
075:08:31|C|Pet|Roger.
075:08:38|T|CDR|Boy, those fracture patterns running down through it are white - appear to be white, layered fracture patterns. They look like somebody's drawn them on there with a piece of chalk.
075:09:38|C|Pet|S-IVB has impacted.
075:09:25|T|CDR|Okay.

075:13:15|T|CDR|Houston, out my window is fine now. We got Petavius with it's central dome of - a whitish cap - dome, and it's a fairly subdued crater, and the lineations running into it - the rilles or whatever they are - are just like it's drawn on the map here.
075:13:44|T|CDR|Some of those central domes are exceptionally dark, and they have exceptionally dark material running down a white surface. You can see that.
075:16:03|T|CMP|With the binoculars, we passed over Langrenus, and you can see blocks on the tops of the central peak, and some features that probably are there that I just haven't noticed before in that central feature. You can see an awful lot of - looks like a - the demarcation where the central feature - looks like a crack in it - has a whole ring of craters that kind of dots that boundary. And then, you see some more of those little craters up along near the top of the central lineament also. And you just don't see those kind of things stand out at you without the binoculars.
075:16:40|C|Pet|Roger.
075:16:44|T|CMP|I could also say that the binoculars at ten power is the maximum you can hold in your hand. You got to get yourself set up very nicely for it before you start.
075:16:53|C|Pet|Roger.

075:27:52|T|CMP|Yeah.
075:27:53|T|CDR|Trouble with the terminator, this Moon is so ragged, I can't - do it even. I'll get a decent terminator shot.
075:28:05|T|CMP|I'll take care of all that. Okay, there's Taylor, Taylor A ... Zöllner - then we have to have ... Descartes. That is Descartes, right there. See the - ...?
075:28:27|T|CDR|Where?
075:28:28|T|CMP|Right down - Here, let me - get to this window; I'll show you. Right there? The crater Descartes.
075:28:28|T|CMP|In this lighting, you can see the Crater Descartes, and it stands out much bigger than you would expect, because of the low Sun angle. And - in fact I had to look in to my map in order to make sure that was what I was looking at. And the material that runs out of it - that - that's in the area, are the things we talk about as being that bright reflective area, in this low Sun angle, has a much blockier and jumbled appearance than it does on any of the high-Sun photographs.
075:29:21|C|Pet|Roger.
075:29:22|T|CMP|It looks very much like looking down on a clinkery - a big clinkery cinder field, but on a much larger scale.
075:29:30|C|Pet|Roger. Copy.
075:29:32|T|LMP|Yeah, a big - a rounded surface of clinkers. It's fantastic. Boy, is that rough!
075:30:15|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, as we look to the west into past the terminator, there's - a couple of degrees past the terminator, there's one bright spot, a peak standing up which is west of - well, west of Kant.
075:30:39|C|Pet|Charlie, you're fading out.
075:30:40|T|LMP|Really high ground. Say again.
075:30:47|C|Pet|Right after you started talking about this peak and you said something like "west of," you faded out.
075:31:06|C|Pet|Go ahead, Charlie.
075:31:45|T|CDR|Yeah, the general opinion here is that we may be looking at part of the Smoky Mountain sticking up through some - through the shadow.
075:31:53|C|Pet|...
075:32:25|C|Pet|Houston, 16, FAO advises you've got some extra film on Magazine UU - that's VHBW, and you can use it for targets of opportunity, and you can use the CEX exposure graph and stop down one stop from what you get off the graph.
075:32:50|T|CDR|Okay, I hear you.
075:33:33|C|Pet|And, Casper, on that last transmission - As an example, f/11 for the CEX, you should go to f/16 to use with Magazine UU.
075:33:47|T|CDR|Okay.
075:36:52|T|CMP|Don, I'd like to verify how we're going to do the P52 again now. Any ideas that we'll go to place the SCS Controls into Rate, High, and Dead Band is Min. At the proper time, I'll - I've got the BMAGs in Rate 2, I'll go to SCS Control, and then I don't have to worry about loading 509. And I'll just go ahead and do the P52.

At the present time, the crew is conducting a program 52 realignment of the inertial measuring unit - inertial measurement unit in the guidance system. To repeat again, the change of shift press briefing with Flight Director Gerry Griffin will be about 4 o'clock Central Time at the Houston News Center Briefing Room. At 75:39, this Apollo Control.
075:40:21|T|CMP|Hey, Don, we're trying to set up the - the camera for the next terminator and sunrise, and I thought I understood what you told me about the settings, but I guess I don't. Can you run through that again? I guess I just as soon have you just give me the proper settings.
075:40:38|C|Pet|You're talking about this Magazine UU that I just called up?
075:40:44|T|CMP|Yes, sir; the VHBW.
075:40:47|C|Pet|Roger; stand by.
075:41:06|C|Pet|Ken, they - they're get - looking that up for us right now. And in the meantime, I'll try to give you the rule again. Maybe that'll clear it up some. You can use that CEX exposure graph that you have on board, and take the readings off of that.
075:41:21|T|CMP|Roger.
075:41:22|C|Pet|And then simply increase the stop number one stop. For example, if the CEX exposure graph calls for f/11 and you're gonna use this Magazine UU, you should go to f/16.
075:41:41|T|CMP|Yeah, okay. I - I thought - I - You used an example; I thought you meant that specifically, and I couldn't make that correlate. Okay. And Charlie says this magazine is HBW instead of VHBW.
075:41:55|C|Pet|That's affirmative; he's right.
075:42:09|C|Pet|And, Casper, for the terminator photography on the next rev, we're recommending you go ahead and use Magazine SS. That's Sierra Sierra.
075:42:23|T|CMP|Okay; use the one we had planned on.
075:42:26|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
075:42:30|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
075:42:50|C|Pet|And, Casper, that call on Magazine UU; we meant to impart to you that you can use that for targets of opportunity.
075:43:01|T|CMP|Roger. Okay, thank you.
075:43:07|C|Pet|Roger.
075:51:11|C|Pet|16, put the High Gain on Auto.
076:05:52|T|CMP|Houston, did you copy our torquing angles?
076:05:56|C|Pet|Affirmative. We got them.
076:06:01|T|CMP|Say again, please.
076:06:03|C|Pet|Affirmative. We got them.
076:06:08|T|CMP|Okay, Don; one comment. I'll try again and take a look at the optics in the - when we get out into the double umbra, but right now in the telescope, I - I can see the stars now, but I still can't see star patterns. Like we looked at - at Antares - and you just couldn't see the Scorpion at all. And that may be due to the extreme amount of earthshine that's being reflected off of the LM. That LM is like looking at it almost in daylight, and, good gosh, the - the Moon looks like you can see everything on there just like - it's really bright.
076:06:46|C|Pet|Right. Okay, Ken; we understand.
076:06:46|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We're ready to switch now to the MSC News Center Briefing Room, for our change of shift briefing. During the course of that briefing we'll be recording air to ground conversations with the crew for playback immediately following.

076:12:34|C|Pet|16, we're about a couple of minutes from LOS. Everything is looking good, and while you're behind the Moon, we'll change shifts and pick you upon the next rev.
076:12:47|T|CDR|Okay. We sure enjoyed it, and we really appreciate all of the things that you guys are doing to get us into orbit here. Man, I don't - That's the kind of help that really does it for us. Thank you much.
076:13:01|C|Pet|Roger; thank you.
076:17:54|T|CMP|Well, I guess that - that sort of makes six days of PTC not so bad.
076:18:25|T|CMP|Let's see, I ought to be able to do both of these at the same time, or can I? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
076:18:32|T|CDR|Both of what?
076:18:33|T|CMP|Both these dumps.
076:18:34|T|CDR|...
076:18:35|T|CMP|... separate.
076:19:27|T|CMP|What time was our - AOS - I mean, sunrise?
076:19:34|T|CDR|Sunrise -
076:19:47|T|CMP|Just look at the Flight Plan, there ...
076:19:50|T|CDR|You hope.
076:19:52|T|LMP|We got to get going here, I'll tell you ...
076:19:55|T|CMP|Well, we've got at least 20 minutes, Charlie.
076:19:57|T|CDR|Charlie, ... Okay. AOS ... LOI, 74 -
076:20:05|T|CMP|No, no, no, no. Look at the Flight Plan where the column stops. It goes from black to white.
076:20:13|T|CDR|Oh. Okay. 76:18 ...
076:20:30|T|LMP|Sunrise?
076:20:32|T|CDR|I don't know. No, it's -
076:20:35|T|LMP|76:28, man.
076:20:36|T|CMP|No, couldn't be.
076:20:39|T|CDR|Well, it - if it goes to black to some other squiggly line, what is that squiggly line? It goes from black to a squiggly line. Okay. And then it becomes full sunrise at 76:35.
076:21:04|T|LMP|Okay, what settings do I use on this color? I don't see how this can show that terminator with color film.
076:21:16|T|CDR|Have any ...?
076:21:22|T|LMP|Em.
076:21:32|T|CMP|...
076:21:43|T|CDR|No, you admit my ability to read the chart. It's wrong. (Laughter) One small step for mankind, here. What do you make it out to be, Charlie?
076:21:57|T|LMP|76:28.
076:21:59|T|CDR|Is that when it gets daytime? Or get sunrise?
076:22:02|T|LMP|That's our sunrise.
076:22:04|T|CDR|Our sunrise. Well, that can't be sunrise, man. He ain't gonna believe that. That's because you're looking at it ..., which you ain't gonna ever see again (laughter). Every time we did this on Apollo 10, a Fuel Cell light came on; every time we ... And I was totally ignorant of what the fuel cell ..., in here somewhere ...
076:23:05|T|CDR|Where are the scissors ...?
076:23:07|T|LMP|I put both pair down there in the ...
076:23:24|T|CMP|...
076:23:53|T|CMP|Here ...
076:24:24|T|CMP|Okay. That's what we need to know.
076:25:39|T|CDR|Did we stop logging our intake and all that stuff today?
076:25:42|T|CMP|Yep. Did that this morning. I mean, after the first ... What time did they say we get the AOS? About -
076:26:05|T|LMP|He didn't say.
076:26:08|T|CDR|I never said.
076:26:11|T|LMP|Neither did the ground.
076:26:15|T|CDR|They're supposed to give us a Rev 2 update for that stuff, and they did, didn't they?
076:26:19|T|CMP|No, I don't think they're supposed to.
076:26:22|T|CDR|Start coming out ...
076:26:24|T|CMP|Yep. It's altered in the Flight Plan.
076:26:28|T|CDR|I guess this is the real crux. If you don't get around on this rev, they've really screwed up.
076:26:36|T|LMP|We had ... terminator I'm supposed to take a picture of.
076:26:39|T|CMP|Then what?
076:26:40|T|CDR|Yeah.
076:26:41|T|CMP|You want me to take a picture of Crookes or not? I - I -
076:26:43|T|LMP|Go ahead.
076:26:44|T|CMP|I ...
076:26:45|T|LMP|I don't want you to take a picture of anything ... asked--
076:26:46|T|CDR|... asked us to ask you to take a picture of it.
076:26:49|T|CMP|Oh. He did. Okay, ...
076:26:52|T|CDR|Please tell those guys - please tell Ken -
076:26:55|T|LMP|Exactly what he said.
076:26:56|T|CDR|- that -
076:26:58|T|LMP|We're sorry he doesn't want to.
076:26:59|T|CDR|What he said was, "I'd like to get a picture of Crookes." He said, "There's a possibility that you guys may be able to pick it up, depending on whose window you're sitting in at the time. I know Ken looks at it, but I don't know if you do or not; but if you happen to be sitting there and it comes around, why don't you get a picture of it?" That's what he said. On account of something, I forget what ...
076:27:30|T|LMP|I'm proud of you.
076:27:31|T|CDR|...
076:27:35|T|CMP|Now, how about putting the 250 lens on there?
076:27:39|T|LMP|Okay. Is that our waste water tank?
076:27:43|T|CDR|Yeah ...
076:27:45|T|LMP|Still got 20 percent more to go.
076:27:51|T|CMP|Don't - don't ... (laughter).
076:27:56|T|CDR|I'm not able to tell that they're doing any of that.
076:27:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 76 hours, 27 minutes. During our Change of Shift Briefing Apollo 16 went behind the Moon nearing the end now of their first revolution of the Moon.

076:28:37|T|CMP|You're right. That's a - that's a rather startling sunrise, isn't it?
076:28:45|T|CDR|Waste water ... 20.
076:28:57|T|LMP|Okay, it's on, Ken.
076:29:00|T|CDR|You want to get over here, Ken?

076:29:02|T|LMP|It's out of this window. Crookes's supposed to be.

076:30:39|T|CMP|It may have gone off from being cooled down.

076:30:44|T|CDR|Take a look in there. The condenser's normal ...
076:31:00|T|LMP|Starting to open the purge ... Maybe we better turn off the waste water dump.

076:31:11|T|LMP|Fuel Cell 1. Okay.
076:31:15|T|CMP|Have you already done the -
076:31:17|T|LMP|It's did with the purge.
076:31:18|T|CMP|Oh. All right. Okay. Okay. This is off.
076:31:23|T|LMP|Okay, right at ten.
076:31:43|T|LMP|Man, we are streaming out a lot of particles with us. Okay, this terminator's coming up, Ken.
076:31:51|T|CMP|Okay. I'm coming. Well, we're not gonna be directly over it until about 34, which is two and a half minutes.
076:32:17|T|LMP|You wouldn't believe all the particles we've got.
076:32:20|T|CMP|Look at that one. Real pretty.

076:33:43|T|LMP|Look at the depth of that crater!
076:33:46|T|LMP|Except for the full Sun, it makes it look very - very -
076:33:49|T|CDR|A lot deeper than it is.
076:33:59|T|CMP|... picture.
076:34:01|T|LMP|... on?
076:34:03|T|CMP|No. Thank you.

076:34:15|T|CMP|... take a couple of pictures here ... Excuse me.
076:34:26|T|LMP|Sure.
076:34:42|T|CDR|There's that central peak in Icarus.
076:34:48|T|CMP|Have you got Icarus?
076:34:50|T|CDR|Right out there on the right. You didn't see that, Charlie.
076:34:54|T|LMP|Oh yeah, I see it, It's taller than a - There it is. Right there. See it?
076:35:01|T|CDR|It isn't really taller,
076:35:04|T|LMP|Right out here. Right on - almost on ... horizon.
076:35:07|T|CMP|Yeah.
076:35:31|T|CMP|Okay, Charlie ...
076:35:47|T|CDR|Why does it look rounder coming around this way than it does when you go into the terminator; it looks straight on the other side.
076:35:54|T|CMP|There's some suspicion that there's a different material.
076:35:58|T|CDR|All right. Just wanted to ask ... Did I say the middle of Icarus looks like a big ... volcano? Couldn't.
076:36:28|T|CMP|What did you call it? Icarus?

076:37:38|T|CDR|Ken will figure it out for you.
076:38:11|T|CDR|... out there.
076:38:29|T|CDR|Looking at the Moon hurts my head. I won't look at it. There's too much down there I don't understand.
076:38:45|T|CDR|Charlie, just keep ... on the book.
076:38:48|T|LMP|That's why I'm purging the fuel cell.
076:38:50|T|CDR|Oh.
076:39:02|T|LMP|I tell you, when we get down to eight miles, we're gonna really look like we're down among them.
076:39:08|T|CDR|Sure are.

076:39:20|T|CMP|Yeah ...
076:39:39|T|CMP|Okay. Get back here, Charlie.
076:40:32|T|CMP|Okay. I guess I can turn that purge - that waste water dump off.

076:40:40|T|CMP|It is?
076:40:41|T|CDR|Yeah.

076:40:57|T|LMP|...
076:41:20|T|CMP|Okay; we get the AOS at -
076:41:27|T|CDR|It really fires thrusters ...
076:41:33|T|CMP|... firing thrusters.
076:41:36|T|CDR|Uh-huh.
076:41:37|T|CMP|Yeah. What do you - what made the comment that you said was really firing one of the thrusters?
076:41:43|T|CDR|...
076:41:44|T|CMP|Oh.

076:42:40|T|CDR|...?

076:42:55|T|CDR|...
076:43:03|T|CMP|They all look different to me when I go hanging upside down.
076:43:06|T|LMP|...
076:43:07|T|CMP|I know they're not supposed to, but they sure do.
076:43:08|T|LMP|Sure do ...
076:43:13|T|CMP|Look at those little tracks down there running in between these two craters.
076:43:52|T|LMP|... big blocks ...
076:43:59|T|CDR|Seen with the naked eye from 60 miles, they've got to be big ...
076:44:03|T|LMP|They're really big.
076:44:05|T|CMP|Which one are you looking at?
076:44:06|T|LMP|...
076:44:07|T|CMP|Oh.
076:44:10|T|LMP|And it has a ray ...
076:44:13|T|CDR|I have to agree that the back side is rather monotonous looking, although I'm sure each one of these craters tells us something, if you're smart enough to know what's going on.
076:44:24|T|CMP|Wish I could clean this window.
076:44:26|T|CDR|Isn't that terrible? Wonder how that happened?
076:44:30|T|CMP|I don't know. It's on the outer pane.
076:44:32|T|CDR|Yeah. Inside of the outer pane.
076:44:35|T|CMP|Yep. It really makes a difference with the binocs.
076:44:39|T|CDR|Yeah.
076:44:45|T|CMP|Man, those are huge features.
076:45:02|T|CDR|What gets me is the ridge - is the - is the ridge line rou - around ... Man, there is just not a flat place anywheres. Do we go over Gagarin?
076:45:16|T|CMP|No.
076:45:17|T|CDR|I didn't think so. We're coming up on something like Mendeleev now? Probably?
076:45:25|T|CMP|Uh -
076:45:28|T|CDR|That big flat thing right there.
076:45:30|T|CMP|Looks about right.
076:45:41|T|CDR|You want to get a picture of the Sea of Moscow? Anybody gotten any good pictures of it?
076:45:47|T|CMP|... we have enough Sim.
076:46:31|T|CMP|AOS? Maybe we should turn this thing off before AOS.
076:46:38|T|LMP|The dump?
076:46:39|T|CMP|Yeah ... - .
076:46:40|T|LMP|Am I looking up north for that?
076:46:43|T|CDR|You're looking up north. Yeah, you're looking north.
076:46:48|T|CMP|Is there still stuff coming out of our dump?
076:46:50|T|CDR|No. It's about to stop.
076:46:52|T|CMP|Okay.
076:47:20|T|CDR|Want me to get a picture of it on the right?
076:47:22|T|CMP|Sure.
076:47:23|T|CDR|It really makes a - Give - give me a thing.
076:47:25|T|LMP|...
076:47:27|T|CMP|Okay.
076:47:28|T|CDR|What should I take it at?
076:47:30|T|CMP|I don't know, John, I'll have to go and see, here.
076:47:33|T|CDR|This can't use 250 at f/11?
076:47:35|T|CMP|I'd better dump it.
076:47:38|T|CDR|Okay.
076:47:40|T|CMP|I ain't sure that's the right thing, but I know it -
076:47:44|T|CDR|This is probably about right for right in here.
076:47:47|T|CMP|Where did my little wheel go?
076:47:51|T|LMP|Here's one right here, Ken.
076:47:52|T|CMP|... Thank you. Well (laughter) -
076:47:56|T|CDR|Will a 250-millimeter lens get it?
076:47:58|T|CMP|John, I don't - I can't see through you, I don't know. But I would think that on the horizon you get most anything because -
076:48:05|T|CDR|Yeah, but that's a long ways out.
076:48:06|T|CMP|...
076:48:13|T|CDR|No, I'll do it ...
076:48:16|T|CMP|... Ten-year medals for free.
076:48:25|T|CDR|... tracking that out ...
076:48:26|T|CMP|... Right?
076:48:33|T|LMP|This is the most unique crater I've ever seen; the one right here with the black rim. It's all white except for the rim. See that bright crater.
076:48:42|T|CMP|Yeah, yeah. That's - that big crater is Chaplygin and the -
076:48:45|T|CDR|Okay. That was the Sea of Moscow. Excuse me.
076:48:49|T|CMP|Okay.
076:48:50|T|CDR|Whatever that means.
076:48:52|T|LMP|Take any good pictures yet?
076:48:53|T|CMP|Yes ...
076:48:56|T|CDR|... handle it ... Soviets ... eat their heart out ...
076:49:04|T|CMP|If they come, I bet they don't quit.
076:49:09|T|CDR|... -
076:49:11|T|CMP|You - you -
076:49:12|T|CDR|- ...
076:49:18|T|LMP|You know, this Window 5 is a little foggy on the outer pane, too.
076:49:21|T|CDR|Yeah.
076:49:22|T|LMP|Just a little.
076:49:32|T|CMP|What frame number was that?
076:49:36|T|CDR|That frame number was number 4 ... Number 4.
076:49:50|T|LMP|Now, we're gonna be able to see earthrise right now.
076:49:59|T|CMP|...
076:50:00|T|LMP|You want to get a picture of earthrise?
076:50:03|T|CDR|Well, probably not. There's probably only been ten million pictures already took of it. But if you're looking for PR, like the Sea of Moscow or some other thing ...
076:50:19|T|CMP|What'd you take it at, 1/250, f/11 - f/87 John?
076:50:25|T|CDR|I put it 1/250 at f/11. f/8 was probably a better choice.
076:51:04|T|CMP|Okay, ... Let me get it set.
076:51:08|T|LMP|...
076:51:09|T|CDR|Yeah, Pitch, 10, and Yaw, 355. We pick them up on Omni C, and then we'll shift over.
076:51:14|T|LMP|Yeah, we can do that.
076:51:32|T|CMP|Okay. And in a few minutes, we're gonna do our systems checks. Huh?
076:51:38|T|LMP|...
076:51:39|T|CMP|Yeah. Okay, we're gonna do our systems checks for DOI. Another one of these things we can get started early.
076:51:57|T|CMP|Dang it ... window screwed up like that? It's really ...
076:52:05|T|LMP|I can't believe it.
076:52:08|T|CDR|What's that, Charlie?
076:52:09|T|LMP|That that's the fu - (laughter) - tape recorder - that that's the Moon down there.
076:52:17|T|CDR|It's the whole thing.
076:52:19|T|LMP|The whole thing. I thought we'd see Tsiolkovsky this rev. Oh, yeah.
076:52:31|T|CMP|It comes again.
076:52:32|T|LMP|That right? Oh, yeah.
076:52:36|T|CDR|Yeah, I imagine when the Soviets start up here, they'll set up their lunar base in the first place; stay for a while.
076:52:46|T|CMP|Now that's really frustrating.
076:52:48|T|LMP|I can't understand what ... doing out over that way.
076:52:51|T|CDR|Man, there sure is a lot of things up here that I don't understand. Look at that big crater down south with the rocks in it. Or - you - you're looking right at it. It's got layers of walls there.
076:53:05|T|CMP|Which direction? That bright one there?
076:53:06|T|CDR|Yeah, the bright one. With the lay - it's got layers of walls in it. I don't know what the name of that one is. It looks like - you get a little higher Sun angle, it looks like anthracite coal laid in against chalk. It doesn't look that way right now.
076:53:21|T|LMP|It's really a unique crater chain down there. Really - ... south of track,
076:53:29|T|CDR|...
076:53:36|T|CMP|Okay, is that -
076:53:37|T|CDR|Yeah, that's ... right there.
076:53:46|T|CMP|Well, that's not - those crater chains there. Let's see, we just passed ... probably?
076:53:56|T|CDR|I just can't get it.
076:53:58|T|CMP|Try it again. You got King? Isn't that King back there?
076:54:05|T|LMP|...?
076:54:06|T|CDR|Right out to the left.
076:54:08|T|LMP|I don't see it. It may be in your window.
076:54:09|T|CDR|Yeah.
076:54:23|T|CMP|Way out there.
076:54:24|T|CDR|Where?
076:54:25|T|CMP|Way out there, yeah.
076:54:26|T|CDR|Okay, I'm looking - right there.
076:54:30|T|CMP|Yeah. I can see it.
076:54:33|T|LMP|.., What do you think about King?
076:54:37|T|LMP|See, it's got kind of funny little things in it -
076:54:39|T|LMP|(Sneeze)
076:54:40|T|CMP|.... that - things that look like lava flows -
076:54:43|T|LMP|(Sneeze).
076:54:45|T|CDR|But they've got to be lava flows running down the side of that mountain there -
076:54:47|T|LMP|(Sneeze)
076:54:48|T|CDR|- whatever made that crater.
076:54:50|T|CMP|It's pretty big.
076:54:51|T|LMP|Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's got to be lava flows.
076:54:54|T|CMP|Okay. These crater chains running down here should lead down to Tsiolkovsky.
076:55:02|T|CDR|Yeah ...
076:55:05|T|LMP|They do! Aha! There it is! ...
076:55:11|T|CDR|Okay, there's ...
076:55:14|T|CMP|Oh, hey, that is pretty -
076:55:15|T|LMP|Isn't that something? ... -
076:55:16|T|CMP|Isn't that a beauty?
076:55:17|T|CDR|Yeah, dang.
076:55:18|T|CMP|That - that must be one of the more spectacular things that ... here.
076:55:22|T|CDR|Oh, you bet.
076:55:26|T|CMP|Well, I'd cancel the earthrise here.
076:55:28|T|CDR|Okay. Okay.
076:55:31|T|CMP|What a treat. And so many things, I can't get. I'm like a little kid with ice cream; I don't know where to start.
076:55:37|T|CDR|Right.
076:55:41|T|LMP|Oh, these windows are just really frosting.
076:55:45|T|CDR|Should be AOSing here pretty quick.
076:55:47|T|LMP|Yeah.
076:55:48|T|CDR|Shouldn't we, Charlie?
076:55:50|T|CMP|Not until we get earthrise.
076:55:54|T|CDR|... what I mean. We were talking to them about King the last time we came across here.
076:56:01|T|CMP|We should get AOS at King. Now is that Thesaur [?]?
076:56:03|T|CDR|No, that's not Pasteur. There's Pasteur. Pasteur's right here.
076:56:09|T|LMP|Ken, is it that little bright one right down there south of King?
076:56:11|T|CMP|That's what I was just wondering, but I think that Pasteur is supposed to be bigger than that.
076:56:17|T|CDR|... could be ... the rays probably coming out of the King.
076:56:20|T|LMP|Yeah.
076:56:21|T|CDR|It looks like it goes in the same sort of a ... See those bright things on the bottom of it?
076:56:25|T|LMP|Yeah ...
076:56:38|T|CDR|... know what this ... and how all this happened.
076:56:43|T|CMP|Look at this - I never noticed this before. We got a crater chain. It goes from here, right straight to the horizon.
076:56:48|T|LMP|Yeah. Right along the track.
076:56:50|T|CMP|Yeah? I never noticed that.
076:56:54|T|CDR|Well, you ain't been here but a few hours.
076:56:57|T|Crew|(Laughter)
076:56:59|T|CDR|Right straight to the horizon?
076:57:00|T|CMP|Yeah. There's a - it starts down here.
076:57:02|T|LMP|South of Pasteur.
076:57:04|T|CMP|And these two - see these two craters?
076:57:05|T|CDR|Yeah.
076:57:06|T|CMP|It's almost right in the center of this window. Starts - And these two craters are together.
076:57:10|T|CDR|Yeah.
076:57:11|T|CMP|And then it cuts down here and it goes towards the horizon and stops at the mare.
076:57:22|T|LMP|Better get ready to ...
076:57:25|T|Crew|(Cough)
076:57:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 76 hours, 57 minutes. We're now less than one minute from the scheduled time of reacquiring Apollo 16.

076:57:43|T|LMP|While we were - while we were ... I guess the weight was 25 pounds, ten percent.
076:57:58|T|CMP|Man, it's frustrating when one of these things pops those things in and out. Wonder what it is that makes it do this; it doesn't do it when you look at it. It only does it when you hit the binoculars. One other picture.
076:58:09|T|LMP|Waste water dump still open?
076:58:11|T|CDR|No. Better not be ... now.

076:58:20|T|LMP|There it comes; there it comes, you guys!
076:58:23|T|CDR|Oh, looky at that.
076:58:24|T|LMP|Isn't that spectacular?

076:58:51|T|CMP|Houston, 16.
076:59:02|T|CMP|Beautiful.
076:59:06|T|LMP|Want me to get them on Omni first?
076:59:08|T|CMP|Yeah.
076:59:11|T|CDR|Houston, 16.
076:59:11|T|CDR|We had S-band Acquisition and S-band High Gain.
076:59:13|C|Har|Hello, 16; Houston. How do you read?
076:59:15|T|LMP|Yeah. Wrong page.
076:59:17|T|CDR|Roger. Read you 5 by, Henry. We just got the 10,000th picture of a beautiful earthrise.
076:59:22|T|LMP|Ain't there yet. Over here.
076:59:24|C|Har|Outstanding.
076:59:33|T|CDR|This is really some place.
076:59:36|T|CMP|We had a chance to watch you get AOS that time. I know we got lots of pictures of it, but you're going to have to look at one more.
076:59:58|T|CMP|That is - man, that is -
077:00:00|T|LMP|Isn't that beautiful?
077:00:02|T|CMP|But you know, some of those photographs around the office that people say are - are no good, that looks the same color to me.
077:00:09|T|LMP|Yeah. I don't think that photo fidelity's true.
077:00:20|T|CMP|Man (laughter) -
077:00:21|T|LMP|... how long before we get to ...
077:00:24|T|CMP|About - ten minutes.
077:00:28|T|LMP|... out the ...
077:00:29|T|CMP|... Yeah.
077:00:30|C|Har|16, Houston. Were you trying to transmit? We heard a little noise on the loop there and looks like our data was dropping in and out; looks good now.
077:00:40|T|CMP|Negative. We weren't trying to say anything, Hank.
077:00:40|T|CMP|He probably didn't get our initial call.
077:00:45|C|Har|Okay.
077:00:56|T|CDR|We just can't find any words. Everybody's peeking out the window here.
077:01:00|C|Har|Roger.
077:01:03|T|CDR|We got all the dumps completed, and we're - all the dumps are secure.
077:01:11|C|Har|Copy.
077:01:15|T|LMP|And I got some pictures on the back side of - Icarus and the - and a black of the Sea of Moscow.
077:01:40|T|LMP|And the material to the north of us at the terminator, we don't think we got ... for.
077:01:40|P|PAO|Those enthusiastic descriptions of the lunar surface have come from all three crewmen. Most recently we heard from John Young and Charlie Duke.

077:09:55|C|Har|Okay; I read you five by five.
077:10:00|T|LMP|Okay, Hank, I'm turning the Pan Camera to Mode, Standby - Power, on.
077:10:03|C|Har|Roger.
077:11:54|T|LMP|Hank - I'm sure they have been described before, but the most - to me, the most unique craters up here - are two that we're just going over now - that - her ejecta blanket is completely white with white interior, but with a black rim to them.
077:12:46|T|CMP|Right down in there.
077:12:47|T|LMP|You know, that SPS comes on a lot -
077:12:48|T|CDR|Right there?
077:12:49|T|LMP|- ... than I thought.
077:12:50|T|CMP|... Descartes.
077:12:51|T|LMP|I thought it would be a big bang, but it's a slow buildup ...
077:12:56|T|CMP|It won't be - the next one will be pretty slow, but the one you feel after that will be a surprise.
077:13:01|T|LMP|I bet. PDI. We get a plane change on board, too, don't we?
077:13:10|T|CDR|Yeah.
077:13:31|T|CMP|Holy smoke. Oh. Here's an eat period. Filled with little things to do. Shh. Gosh.
077:18:17|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
077:18:20|C|Har|Go ahead.
077:18:26|T|LMP|Hey, Hank, how do the SPS data look?
077:18:28|C|Har|Okay, we were just talking about that, Charlie. Apparently, we had a real nominal burn. Our data down here showed a burn time of six minutes, 14.2 seconds, which is right on the money. And I got a few words on that PC drop. I understand that's completely normal for the first dual-bank burn, due to some helium bubbles that are normally trapped between the ball valves. So that wasn't unexpected for the first dual-bank burn - you shouldn't see it again. And as far as the SPS pressure lights that came on, we warned you earlier to expect that, due to the pressure surge of the tanks pressurizing, we - you were right on the 200-psi limit - that triggered it. The second pressure light you got, which is apparently still on, is due to heat soak back into the tank. So it's not unexpected either.
077:19:20|T|LMP|Okay, fine. We passed that word on to you about the light. Not that we weren't expecting it, but just to tell you what had happened.
077:19:28|C|Har|Okay.
077:19:43|C|Har|16, Track Mode Auto on High Gain.
077:19:52|T|CDR|Okay. You got it.
077:21:06|T|CDR|Houston, 16. Over.
077:21:08|C|Har|Go ahead.
077:21:17|T|CDR|That crater Icarus - we got the profile picture of. It's a big round crater and it has real steep walls, and the central peak is a - the central peak is a little above the crater walls, and you'll see that profile when you get the picture back. But the shape of the central peak is such that the only Earth analog I've ever seen that looked like it was sort of a shield volcano. I never saw anything like that in the - Now, I'm not saying the whole thing is not an impact, but that central peak is really unusual.
077:21:58|C|Har|Roger. We copy, and we're also through with the Pan Camera - you can go Power Off on that.
077:23:25|T|LMP|Houston, apparently this line of secondaries down here that cross the mare - gives you the impression that there have been a couple of great big chickens been walking across there.
077:23:37|C|Har|Roger.
077:23:40|T|CDR|That - that was courtesy of Charlie Duke, our airborne geologist and chicken farmer.
077:23:52|C|Har|Roger. Maybe you better watch your step.
077:23:58|T|CDR|I'm watching.

077:31:45|T|CMP|Hank, you can tell Farouk that -those smooth areas we thought we saw around Isidorus and Capella are indeed uniquely different in texture. They are quite smooth. We'll get a chance to play with them later.
077:32:04|C|Har|Hey, that sounds real interesting, Ken.
077:32:21|C|Har|How are your systems checks coming?
077:32:26|T|CMP|Roger; Hank. We've already finished those.
077:32:28|C|Har|Okay.
077:32:28|P|PAO|Ken Mattingly's reference on that last observation was to Farouk Albaz, one of the geologists who has worked very closely with the crew and particularly with Mattingly in training him for the orbital photography and recognition of geologic landmarks on the Moon. </p>   <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer</b> Ken Mattingly's reference on that last observation was to Farouk Albaz, one of the geologists who has worked very closely with the crew and particularly with Mattingly in training him for the orbital photography and recognition of geologic landmarks on the Moon.
077:34:03|T|CMP|Henry, the amount of terminator movement in one rev is kind of dramatic up here. Last time around, Descartes just barely showed as a crater - but showed very dramatically - and now it's - as it moves out it's starting to lose some of the starkness, and I'll get a picture of this bright zone. And it sure looks right now the material that is just to the north of the crater Descartes and that stuff that we talked about going between Delambre B and Descartes A are in fact extensions of the things that go into the Smoky end Stone Mountains. They - right now - look like they have a very similar texture.
077:34:47|C|Har|Roger; we copy.
077:37:36|T|CMP|Hank, it sure looks like we can see Gator and Palmetto from here. It's almost straight down.
077:37:42|C|Har|Does it look like the map?
077:37:47|T|CMP|Well, that stuff around the outside sure doesn't look like it did at high Sun.
077:38:04|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. If you will give us Accept, we'll up-link state vector and target load.

077:46:05|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, before we do that - Looking at the change to the Flight Plan here, we got to load the Verb 48 to put in the proper DAP, and ... to start 509, and then go to the P52. Can we go ahead and stop · the maneuver now and will this attitude clear enough things so we can get a P52 in there?
077:46:29|C|Har|Stand by.
077:46:34|T|CMP|I'm sorry; I didn't copy that.
077:46:35|C|Har|Roger. Stand by a minute, Ken, I'll have FAO check.
077:46:42|T|CMP|Thank you. I was worried about getting in the same problem we get into after undocking tomorrow, where it might take a special angle.
077:46:52|C|Har|Roger. Understand.
077:47:10|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. FAO says this is a good attitude.
077:48:39|C|Har|16, Houston. Are you ready for the TEI-5 pad yet?
077:48:43|T|LMP|Roger; go ahead.

077:51:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 77 hours, 54 minutes. During the last few minutes among the sets of numbers passed up to the crew by CAPCOM Hank Hartsfield, were those they will use in performing the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver, and that burn is to occur at 78 hours; 33 minutes; 44 seconds. The maneuver will be performed using the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine. It will be primarily a retrograde burn resulting in slowing the spacecraft by about 203.8 feet [62.1 metres] per second or about 136 miles [219 kilometres] per hour. And as a result of that, we expect the orbit to be changed to 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 kilometres].

077:55:27|C|Har|Roger. Stand by.
077:56:39|C|Har|Your P30 looked good, Ken.
077:56:46|T|CMP|Okay. The question was, do you want to take a look at the rotated vector in P40 before we start our maneuver, or can we go ahead and start the maneuver?
077:57:20|T|CDR|Houston, did you miss the question?
077:57:25|C|Har|Negative, but we're having trouble finding an answer.
077:57:30|T|CDR|Okay.
077:57:48|C|Har|16, Houston. Go ahead and call P40, then maneuver.

078:10:02|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, we're coming up now on nine minutes until loss of contact with Apollo 16. About 19½ minutes away from the time the crew will be performing the descent orbit insertion maneuver. This maneuver of course performed behind the Moon we'll be out of radio contact and we'll get our first look at the results of that maneuver when they come back around on the other side of the Moon on their third revolution, this burn is a very critical maneuver which must be performed in very pre--within very precise limits and particularly in the shutdown which the computer will signal. An overburn of slightly more than one second would place the spacecraft out of trajectory which would impact the Moon if it were not corrected. The normal procedure that the crew would follow in the event that they do get an over-burn is to take out the over burn by using the Reaction Control System thrusters. We'll get about ten minutes of tracking as they come around the front side of the Moon on their third revolution and based on this information we'll give them a go no-go to stay in the trajectory resulting from the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. If we don't like the looks of the trajectory based on ground tracking they'll be told to perform the bailout burn. And that maneuver is scheduled at 79 hours, 22 minutes, eight seconds in the Flight Plan if it is required and would place the spacecraft in a safe 62 by--62.6 by 5.3 nautical mile orbit, again this is a contingency procedure only, and would be used only for some reason the descent orbit insertion maneuver was not as planned and the spacecraft was determined to be in an unsafe orbit.

Assuming that maneuver when as planned, and the orbit is as we would expect, Apollo 16 should be at an altitude of about 19 nautical miles [35 kilometres] above the lunar surface, accounting for Charlie Duke's earlier comment that it appeared to be right down among the tree tops.
079:17:42|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. You're good on the short arc. You have a stay, and we show you 59 by 10.7.
079:17:53|T|CDR|Roger; 59 by 10.7. Thank you, sir.
079:19:13|C|Har|16, Houston. Can you - could you give us Auto on the High Gain?
079:19:21|T|CDR|Roger. You have it.
079:20:04|T|CMP|Henry, if you remember that little real bright crater on the northern rim of Chaplygin that Stu and Farouk were talking about the other day, we - we happened to see it right up close to us as we came by on this orbit, and we got a couple of pics for you on it, and that really is an unusual little guy. And it's really beautiful.
079:20:29|C|Har|Roger; copy.
079:20:35|T|CMP|Probably getting carried away with all of this, but we've - we've got all kinds of things to see back there. It would really be nice to fly that kind of an orbit down low.
079:20:44|C|Har|Roger.
079:20:49|T|CMP|And, we're pitching down to our landmark track attitude, and this is my first chance to point the sextant at the surface, and the sextant is just as clear as a bell. It's beautiful. You can pick out little bitty features. They're just -they're just as clear. There's no fuzziness. And the telescope's the same way.
079:21:08|C|Har|Hey, that's great: We ought to be able to get some good use out of that.
079:21:08|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. The landmark tracking Ken Mattingly is referring to is a procedure used on board the spacecraft to determine their orbit. It's also a procedure that will be used by Mattingly from lunar orbit to track the spacecraft on the surface of the Moon, hopefully, and allow scientist on the ground to compute a precise location for the landing site for the touchdown part of the Lunar Module. We now show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 13.8 nautical miles [25.6 kilometres], continuing to drop down towards Pericynthion. And the preliminary tracking data, the flight dynamics officer reported, shows an orbit of 59 by 10.7 [nautical miles 109 by 19.8 kilometres]. We expect that that orbit will be refined somewhat as we get additional tracking that's based on the first look of the tracking data, but is very close to the desired orbit of 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 kilometres].</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

079:23:11|C|Har|16, Omni Delta.
079:26:17|T|LMP|Hank, out to the - my side, out Window 5, there was one crater here that you could see in one section of it, it looked like some outcrop two-thirds the way up the crater wall, and some big blocks had rolled down the - into the crater floor, and you could see the boulder tracks all the way down.
079:26:37|C|Har|Roger; copy. Can you locate that one?
079:26:42|T|LMP|Wait a minute. No, I'm pretty lost right now. Let me see if I can figure it out.
079:27:11|C|Har|Ken, while you're maneuvering there, we'd like to ask what value did you put in your EMS, and what did you get on your EMS check?
079:28:28|T|LMP|Houston, 16. That crater I had, I think was in a series around Maclaurin, maybe a little bit further west than that.
079:28:41|C|Har|Roger; copy.
079:29:40|T|LMP|Hank, coming across the mare here, it reminds you of ... static system cals at Edwards.
079:29:49|C|Har|Roger. You're really down low, screaming across, huh?
079:30:24|C|Har|16, Houston. Did you copy the question I had about the EMS Delta-V?
079:31:21|T|LMP|Houston, the Goclenius Rille looks like large grabens with very subdued sides to them; no outcrop at all apparent from my position.
079:31:36|C|Har|Roger; copy.
079:31:47|T|LMP|And looking on up into the Gutenberg Rilles you can see it cross - one crater just climbs right across the crater wall.
079:31:57|C|Har|Roger.
079:32:00|T|LMP|And that's Gutenberg Sea. That's Gutenberg Sea, Hank, and you can see the wall is down,dropped into the rille.
079:32:10|C|Har|Roger; copy. How do you read, Charlie?
079:32:15|T|LMP|I'm reading you five by.
079:32:19|C|Har|Okay. A littler earlier, I asked a question about the EMS Delta-V. Did you copy that?
079:32:25|T|LMP|Negative; we did not.
079:32:27|C|Har|Okay -
079:32:28|T|LMP|It - it read minus 2.3.
079:32:29|C|Har|Roger. We had a question here as to how the EMS Delta-V check came out, and which value you loaded into the Delta-V counter?
079:32:41|T|LMP|Stand by.
079:32:44|T|CMP|Can I call you in a second on that, Hank?
079:32:45|C|Har|Sure thing.
079:32:47|T|CMP|It was like - it was like 1.8 at shutdown because of the drift in the EMS, and I did a check, and it came out to be normal and the bias was the same. I put in the Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, the same thing that we've used before, but then it looked to me like the bias was in - less than half a foot per second.
079:33:06|C|Har|Roger; copy. We were a little confused here because the - the value that you had at the end there was somewhere in between what we thought it ought to be, depending on which setting you put in the Delta-V counter.
079:33:19|T|CMP|Roger. It was about 1.6 or something like that at shutdown. I'll have to look back at the Flight Plan.
079:33:30|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. The walls - the north wall of Capella has striations that are dipping eastward about 60 degrees or so, all the way across the north face.
079:33:46|C|Har|Roger. Copy, Charlie.
079:33:51|T|LMP|Okay, and also Isidorus, the same thing.
079:33:55|C|Har|Roger.
079:34:14|C|Har|J-2 should be on the horizon now, Ken.
079:34:19|T|CMP|Roger. We got the - it's right on the horizon. Still haven't picked up the target yet. Looks like it's tracking just about right. I have Theophilus going out of the field of view now.
079:36:09|C|Har|Ken, you're coming up on about 30 seconds to TCA.
079:36:22|T|LMP|He has the target, Houston.
079:36:26|C|Har|Roger.
079:38:54|T|CMP|Big old hill down the stream from - Where you are going ...?
079:39:02|T|CDR|Guess who is sneaking in marks on Gator Crater right now?
079:39:07|C|Har|I wonder who.
079:39:07|P|PAO|Gator crater is about 700 yards across one of the craters at the Descartes landing site.

079:40:26|T|CDR|Now that's what I call OJT right there.
079:40:33|C|Har|How did the landing site look through the sextant?
079:40:45|T|CDR|You have to do that with the telescope, Hank.
079:40:48|C|Har|Roger.
079:41:11|T|LMP|I think that was the best high-speed pass I've ever made.
079:41:15|C|Har|Roger.
079:42:42|C|Har|16, Houston. I have your Map[ping] and Pan Camera photo PADs for 80:35 whenever you're ready.
079:43:06|T|CMP|Okay, Henry; go ahead.
079:43:09|C|Har|Roger. T-start, 080:38:01; T-stop, 080:46:04. And that same PAD is good for the Pan Camera.
079:43:32|T|CMP|Okay. T-start, 080:38:01; T-stop, 080:46:04.
079:43:40|C|Har|Good readback.
079:43:42|T|CMP|That'll be the same PAD for both cameras.
079:44:04|C|Har|16, Houston. We'd like for you to go on and get in the SIM bay attitude so we can get our DSE dump.
079:44:13|T|CMP|Wilco.
079:44:51|T|CMP|Hey, Hank, you want me to go ahead and do this Single Jet Authority, or use couples to go to the attitude?
079:44:59|C|Har|Stand by.
079:45:10|C|Har|Ken, why don't you go ahead and go coupled, then we can go Single Jet.
079:45:15|T|CMP|Okay. Sounds like a good plan.
079:47:11|C|Har|16, Omni Charlie.
079:47:58|T|CMP|Hark, would you check on one thing for me? Would you find out if this method I've been using for reading out the maneuver times, Verb 4 Noun 1, is in any way affected by or affects the use of Program 509?
079:48:14|C|Har|Will do, Ken.
079:48:18|T|CMP|Thank you, sir. And I got a couple of minutes here, if you would like to go over some of those questions you had before now. I - I wasn't paying much attention.
079:48:33|C|Har|Stand by, Ken. I think they got your answer awhile ago and it satisfied them, but I'll make sure.
079:48:40|T|CMP|Okay. I wasn't paying a lot of attention; I was trying to pick up that landmark.
079:48:46|C|Har|Do you have any comments on the landmark tracking? Did it all go smoothly?
079:48:52|T|CMP|Well, except for the fact that those optics are perfect, that's really neat. The target area did not look as I anticipated. It's a - I think it's a function of the low Sun angle, but it looked to me like there were far more rims around the craters than - than what - the impression I had from looking at things on the - on the models. And I did not pick up North or South Ray; they still were in the shadows. So, I guess it's possible that I could have been on the wrong crater, but it sure looked like to me like I must have been on Gator.
079:49:30|C|Har|Roger; copy.
079:49:32|T|CMP|It's still - still a problem in scaling when you look at something like that, until you're sure that you have the right feel for it. But I think it's pretty obvious, and I think picking it up tomorrow will be relatively easy.
079:50:45|C|Har|16, Houston. Could you bring up the High Gain, Pitch plus 35, Yaw 290.
079:51:02|T|CMP|Say again your Yaw number.
079:51:03|C|Har|Roger; 290.
079:51:36|C|Har|And, Ken, there's no problem in -
079:51:40|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, and we're about - Go ahead, Hank.
079:51:44|C|Har|Roger. They say there is no problem in calculating maneuver completion time, and - and it does not interfere with 509.
079:51:55|T|CMP|Okay, thank you. I've been avoiding using that. All right. We're about ready to go through our solar monitor and tiedown release. You folks ready for us to do that?
079:52:12|C|Har|Roger. We're ready to go, Ken.
079:52:18|T|CMP|Okay.
079:54:23|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. We released the tiedowns and the door and heard just a very tiny little sound on each of those activities.
079:54:33|C|Har|Roger. We copy, Ken.
079:55:11|T|CMP|Hank, another piece of questionable data that've collected today is - well, on our low pass on the back side there, we got our color wheel out. And we have two votes for Number 17, and one vote for Number 13.
079:55:28|C|Har|Roger; copy.
079:55:30|T|CMP|And that's over on the back side just past Chaplygin. And Number 17 really isn't quite right; it's just the closest thing we have. And the same comment applies to Number 13.
079:55:41|T|CDR|Well, I still say 13 was right on.
079:55:46|T|CMP|You'll never guess who voted for 13.
079:55:52|T|CDR|The grits have affected his vision.
079:55:56|C|Har|That's probably what it is, John.
079:56:00|T|CDR|Right.
079:56:11|T|LMP|Hey, Hank, ask Stu who he believes.
079:56:15|C|Har|Will do.
079:59:40|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. We have a SIM bay jett configuration, and I'm going to start deploying equipment.
079:59:46|C|Har|Roger; copy.
080:02:01|C|Har|Ken, you want to keep us posted on what you're doing there with the switches?
080:02:07|T|CMP|Okay. I got the Mapping Camera Door Opens and the Alpha Cover Door Open, and the Mapping Camera's going out. And we've just gone through one minute of extend time, and I'm timing the first one.
080:02:17|C|Har|Roger; copy.
080:02:19|T|CMP|I'll do the Gamma Ray and Mass Spec booms sequentially afterwards, so I can pay attention to the times.
080:02:30|T|CMP|Okay. And I've got gray on the Mapping Camera, Extend, and that was at one minute and 20 seconds.
080:02:37|C|Har|Roger; copy.
080:02:57|T|CMP|Okay. Can you read me on vox, Henry?
080:03:00|C|Har|Roger.
080:03:03|T|CMP|Okay. That's the way we'll operate. I'm going to the Gamma Ray, Deploys at this time. I'm going to hold it for barber pole plus two seconds, then Off. Going to Deploy. Deploy. Barber pole now, 1, 2, Off; and it' s gray. Gamma Ray is coming to Retract.
080:03:27|T|CMP|Mark. Barber pole, and it's gray. Okay. Going to the Mass Spectrometer. Deploy.
080:03:42|T|CMP|Mark. Barber pole, 1, 2, Off. Mass Spec to Retract.
080:03:48|T|CMP|Mark. Barber pole, Off. Okay. They're both in the Retract position, and everything looks normal. The X-Ray is coming On.
080:04:00|T|CMP|Mark. I've completed the Gamma Ray and Mass Spec Boom deployment and retraction, and I'm ready to go ahead with the Mass Spec, Deploy, if that's okay with you.
080:04:15|C|Har|Roger; go ahead.
080:04:27|T|CMP|Okay; it's Deploy on the Mass Spec, and I'm timing it.
080:05:18|C|Har|Give us Auto on the High Gain, 16.
080:05:21|T|CMP|Five seconds to stop. Okay, it's Off on the Mass Spectrometer, and you have Auto.
080:05:38|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. You've got the Mass Spec out to 8.4 feet.
080:05:43|C|Har|Roger; looks good down here.
080:05:45|T|CMP|Laser Altimeter is coming On.
080:05:49|T|CMP|Mark.
080:06:02|T|CMP|And can I go ahead and put the Mass Spec Experiment On without waiting the three or four minutes?
080:06:07|C|Har|Stand by. Roger. Go ahead.
080:06:16|T|CMP|Okay. Mass Spectrometer Experiment is coming On.
080:06:22|T|CMP|Mark. The Ion Source is going to Standby.
080:06:29|T|CMP|Mark it.
080:09:04|T|CMP|Can you tell how the Laser is doing yet, Hank?
080:09:09|C|Har|Stand by, Ken. We'll take a look. Laser looks good, Ken.
080:09:21|T|CMP|Outstanding.

080:39:49|T|CMP|25&frac12;?
080:39:50|T|LMP|Yeah.
080:40:00|T|LMP|... about to eat the chocolate bar, huh?
080:40:10|T|CMP|Mmm-hmm.
080:40:20|T|CMP|We will for that one.
080:40:24|T|LMP|You want to try it again, Ken, and let me watch it?
080:40:26|T|CMP|No.
080:40:27|T|LMP|...
080:40:31|T|CMP|Oh, I don't really think there's any future in that.
080:40:44|T|CDR|Make sure the ground doesn't want to try it either.
080:40:48|T|CMP|...
080:40:51|T|LMP|...
080:40:52|T|CMP|Pan Camera.
080:40:56|T|CDR|Pan Camera?
080:40:57|T|CMP|Yep. Yeah, but the Pan Camera's on Main A.
080:41:07|T|CDR|Well -
080:41:12|T|LMP|...
080:41:13|T|CMP|Nope. Any conclusion they come to would be guessing anyhow. I suspect that Main B is running a little bit lower than Main A and they probably both got pulled down. You didn't happen to notice ...? I'm sure you didn't. I wouldn't have.
080:41:33|T|CDR|No. All I saw was MA.
080:41:47|T|CMP|Let's see. We're running 38 - almost 40 on Fuel Cell 3; 24 and 22. That's 32, 64 - 100 amps. That 's a shame.
080:42:34|T|CMP|Main Bus B Undervolt; 27 volts? I don't understand that. Must have been a -
080:42:44|T|LMP|Did you get another one?
080:42:45|T|CMP|Yeah.
080:42:46|T|LMP|Huh?
080:42:47|T|CMP|Yeah.
080:42:48|T|CDR|For what?
080:42:49|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well, John, I don't know what from. It's on 27 - 26-1/2 volts. Main A is on 27-1/2. Fuel Cell 3 -
080:42:58|T|CDR|Fuel cells falling apart?
080:42:59|T|CMP|No, I think they're running - normal. It's only pulling 37 amps. Now it's something - just cycle it up to 40 amps.
080:43:12|T|CDR|What's ... fuel cell? Check ...?
080:43:15|T|CMP|That's running about right. It must have been sitting right on the - I got some heater load on there. Main B. Those radiators couldn't be cycling, could they?
080:43:28|T|CDR|...
080:43:31|T|CMP|No. What's the radiator outlet temperature? 25 - No, they're not on.
080:43:37|T|CDR|...
080:43:55|T|CMP|Oh, shoot.
080:43:56|T|LMP|We've got 28 volts now.
080:43:58|T|CMP|Yep.
080:44:00|T|CDR|What else did you shut off?
080:44:03|T|CMP|Nothing ...
080:44:15|T|CMP|Well, we aren't running the thing.
080:44:19|T|LMP|Check the -
080:44:20|T|CMP|Check the pressures on that.
080:44:21|T|LMP|...
080:44:24|T|CMP|Yeah, they're getting a pretty good spread there.
080:44:40|T|CDR|That's strange.
080:44:49|T|CMP|I think there's something wrong with that oxygen regulator. The flows in that thing are very unstable.
080:44:57|T|CDR|Fuel Cell 3?
080:44:58|T|LMP|Yeah.
080:45:00|T|CMP|Well - You know, I guess it really isn't bouncing that much more than the others. It's just that there's a bigger delta flow between the oxygen and the hydrogen here.
080:45:11|T|CDR|Charlie, can you hand me my - my spoon out of my temporary stowage bag over there?
080:45:25|T|CMP|Pressures all look normal?
080:45:27|T|LMP|Regs look okay.
080:45:28|T|CMP|Okay. Well, we've got high bit rate data on all this. They can take a look.
080:45:37|T|LMP|Pressure's good.
080:45:57|T|LMP|... all right? Okay?
080:45:59|T|CMP|Okay.
080:46:00|T|CDR|Cryo 1 ... pressures are okay. Beats me ...
080:46:45|T|CMP|Mapping Camera coming to Standby - Off. Image Motion is Off. Laser Altimeter is Off. Mapping Camera - Got a barber pole on Image Motion, and the Laser is Off. Mapping Camera's going to Retract.
080:47:08|T|CDR|Pan Camera shouldn't have anything to do with it, should it?
080:47:11|T|CMP|Mark. And a barber pole on the Retract, the Mapping Camera.
080:47:18|T|CDR|I thought that stuff was on Main B -
080:47:20|T|CMP|They're split.
080:47:21|T|CDR|- Service Module/AC Power?
080:47:23|T|CMP|Yeah?
080:47:24|T|CDR|I mean Service Module/AC Power is off of Main B, because -
080:47:28|T|CMP|It's half and half.
080:47:29|T|CDR|Is it half and half? Because -
080:47:30|T|CMP|(Laughter)
080:47:31|T|CDR|Well, the reason I said so - the reason I thought it was - I mean - because I was reading the schematic somewhere and I thought you could lose - that they're in series and the fact that, if you lost this thing, it would cost you your B servo.
080:47:52|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to have to climb over where you are, John, for just a minute.
080:48:00|T|CDR|Charlie, you need to shift.
080:48:03|T|LMP|You want me to climb out of here? Where you want to go?
080:48:07|T|CDR|I don't know. Ken's got to be over here, and he's got to be over there.
080:48:10|T|CMP|Golly, there's some of those flows that go up the sides of walls.
080:48:15|T|LMP|Okay.
080:48:16|T|CDR|Get the Pan Camera ...
080:48:34|T|LMP|Pan Camera on now?
080:48:35|T|CMP|No.
080:48:44|T|CMP|Well, now. Guess who's got their next - next failure. A Mapping Camera that's out - to stay.
080:48:59|T|CMP|(Laughter) I figured it would break, but I thought it would last more than one extension.
080:49:16|T|CMP|There's 2 minutes and it hasn't come in.
080:49:19|T|CDR|How long's it supposed to take?
080:49:21|T|CMP|A minute and a half.
080:49:34|T|CMP|Hey, John, can you - let me in there?
080:50:10|T|CMP|Is that - barber pole still on the Mapping Camera?
080:50:14|T|LMP|No, Ken, it's back in.
080:50:15|T|CMP|Back to gray?
080:50:16|T|LMP|Yeah.
080:50:17|T|CMP|Okay. It must have taken about - three minutes.
080:50:29|T|CMP|Watch the stick. I got it activated.
080:51:31|T|CMP|What's that 401 say? ...
080:51:39|T|LMP|...
080:54:14|T|CDR|... in here ...
080:54:23|T|CMP|You brute. Gol-dang-it. That thing went in before. There we go.
080:54:29|T|CDR|...
080:54:49|T|CDR|That ... like it should be?
080:55:51|T|CMP|I thought I put ... Ok, no, I did.
080:55:56|T|CDR|Okay ...
080:56:00|T|CMP|What's that?
080:56:01|T|CDR|...
080:56:02|T|CMP|That'd never happen.
080:56:09|T|CDR|You told me to put it back, so I did.
080:56:11|T|LMP|It's right there.
080:56:15|T|CDR|Ha! Would you believe ...?
080:56:17|T|LMP|What?
080:56:20|T|CDR|...
080:56:23|T|LMP|How long are ...?
080:56:28|T|CDR|I don't know. ... there. You only have ... then you gonna get that Main B Undervolt coming out on the front side ...
080:56:40|T|LMP|Right now.
080:57:00|T|CMP|Gol-dang-it. Once again. Didn't give me any pan. Set the High Gain at 0 and 170?
080:57:47|T|CMP|You say you'd set your ...?
080:57:49|T|LMP|...
080:57:50|T|CMP|Okay. That's Manual and Wide.
080:57:52|T|LMP|Okay.
080:58:00|T|CMP|Okay. How about Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover to Close? Let's see, verify that that Mapping Camera Retract barber pole is off and that the switch is in the Retract position.
080:58:17|T|LMP|Yeah.
080:58:19|T|CMP|Okay.
080:58:20|T|LMP|Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter to Close?
080:58:22|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
080:58:23|T|LMP|The cover?
080:58:24|T|CMP|Yep.
080:58:25|T|LMP|Close.
080:58:26|T|CMP|Barber pole? Back to gray?
080:58:28|T|LMP|Yeah. It was so fast I didn't ...
080:58:31|T|CMP|Okay.
080:58:42|T|CMP|When am I going to eat?
080:58:48|T|LMP|...
080:58:49|T|CMP|No, go ahead and finish your -
080:58:50|T|CDR|Tell me what you want -
080:58:51|T|CMP|- finish your cleanup.
080:58:52|T|CDR|- and then I'll finish it up for you.
080:58:53|T|CMP|No, go ahead and finish whatever you've got to do to get ready for tomorrow because the next thing I'm going to have to do is go to bed.
080:58:57|T|LMP|...
080:59:04|T|CMP|Okay.
080:59:05|T|LMP|...
080:59:06|T|CMP|Yeah.
080:59:11|T|CDR|That's how we figured these - Where those water bags at, Charlie? We ought to fill those, right?
080:59:23|T|LMP|... exact ...
080:59:27|T|CDR|Okay. Where are the ... -
080:59:30|T|CMP|Is this -
080:59:31|T|LMP|Back there towards the end -
080:59:32|T|CMP|- is this John's chow?
080:59:33|T|LMP|...
080:59:34|T|CMP|That's mine, too? In addition to this?
080:59:35|T|LMP|No, no, wait a minute ... Couldn't ... chicken stew.
080:59:39|T|CDR|You want a wet pack? You sure?
080:59:41|T|CMP|This.
080:59:42|T|CDR|All right. That's mine.
080:59:43|T|CMP|That yours?
080:59:44|T|CDR|...
080:59:46|T|CMP|Yeah.
081:00:00|T|CMP|Oh, oh. Let me. Let me do some more things here. This ain't going to work (laughter).
081:00:12|T|CDR|Yeah. Well, it's too old (laughter).
081:00:16|T|LMP|This is downright dry!
081:00:18|T|CDR|What do you want me to do?
081:00:19|T|CMP|Well, I -
081:00:20|T|CDR|- ... Panel 230.
081:00:21|T|CMP|There ain't no way to have an eat period in all this, isn't it?
081:00:24|T|CDR|Looks like you can't have an eat period and see what's on the Flight Plan because you're gonna have ...
081:00:30|T|CMP|Yeah. Except this is the first time to move the boom, and I'd like to move it. But I got to have the Flight Plan to see what time - Go ahead and finish your menu. No, it's on the other page.
081:00:51|T|CDR|...
081:00:53|T|CMP|Mass Spec and Gamma Ray to Deploy. Okay. Go ahead. Finish your Flight Plan.
081:01:07|T|CMP|Okay. There's a barber pole on the Gamma Ray Boom.
081:01:22|T|CMP|And the Mass Spec was running - 15 seconds after that one.
081:01:28|T|CDR|...
081:01:39|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, sir.
081:01:49|T|LMP|Well, John, you want to put on the LTV - LCG ...?
081:01:53|T|CDR|Yeah. After a bit - soon as I defecate ...
081:02:12|T|CMP|Okay ... 1, 2 -
081:02:25|T|CMP|Stir up.
081:02:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 81 hours, four minutes. We're standing by now to regain radio contact with Apollo 16 now in it's fourth revolution of the Moon.

081:06:01|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston.
081:07:22|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. How do you read?
081:07:29|T|CDR|You're five by, Hank.
081:07:31|C|Har|Roger. Our data down here we worked on during the back side shows you're in 58.8 by 10.6.
081:07:46|T|CDR|Okay. And while - while we were on the back side, we had a couple of Main B Undervolt lights.
081:07:55|C|Har|Roger. Copy. You want to tell us about it?
081:08:03|T|CDR|Stand by. Yeah, it was when Ken was - messing around with the SIM bay, and he'll fill you in.
081:08:11|C|Har|Okay.
081:08:14|T|CMP|Yeah, we got a little behind on this sequence already, Hank. But as soon as I turned the - had the Mapping on and it worked fine, I turned the Pan Camera on, and as soon as I went to Operate on the Pan Camera, we got a Main B Undervolt. So I turned it back to Standby and left it there. Charlie said he saw about 25 volts on Main B, and concluded I'd wait and let you take a look at it. And then we got another Main B Undervolt at some five minutes or so later, and it again was momentary. By the time we looked at it, it all looked pretty normal. The only - We checked the fuel cell regulator pressures. They looked good, and I really don't have any idea what might of caused it.
081:09:02|C|Har|Yeah. All the things we could check look okay.
081:09:06|T|LMP|Hank, we got a - it might not even be a small anomaly, but Fuel Cell 3, the H<sub>2</sub> flow's running a little bit higher than the O<sub>2</sub> flow, but the regulator pressure looks fine to me. But the other two fuel cells, H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, match.
081:09:24|C|Har|Roger. We copy, Charlie.
081:10:13|T|CDR|My guess is when you dump the DSE the whole story will be right on there probably.
081:10:17|C|Har|Okay ... John.
081:10:23|T|CDR|When you get the DSE translated, probably tell you what happened.
081:10:25|C|Har|Roger. We copy.
081:11:07|T|CMP|Hank, you really can see both the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray booms deployed.
081:11:07|||<p class="tech"><b>081 11 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Understand you can see them both.
081:11:14|T|CMP|That's affirmative. Looks like a couple of feet of the boom is about all you can see.
081:11:28|C|Har|You've really got us puzzled with this undervolt now, because the Pan Camera runs off from Main A.,
081:11:44|T|CMP|Yeah, we'd noticed the same thing. It - you know it may not be rational, but it just seemed like that was the - I touched one switch and got a Main Undervolt so I took it back off again. Decided to even let you think about it before I ... anymore.
081:11:52|T|LMP|Possible that it doesn't have any connection.
081:11:53|C|Har|Roger.
081:12:09|T|CMP|I still have the power on it, Hank. I've got it in Standby and Power on.
081:12:15|C|Har|Roger. Copy. And, Ken, I'd like to verify - is your- Nonessential Bus on Main A or Main B?
081:12:28|T|CMP|That's Main A.
081:12:30|C|Har|Roger.
081:13:03|T|LMP|And, Hank, last night we - I - think we got verification that we could wear the LCGs to bed tonight and be all ready to go by in the morning.
081:13:14|C|Har|That is affirmative.
081:13:20|T|LMP|Okay. Anybody thought any more about my suit?
081:13:26|C|Har|We thought about it, and smoked it over, and we kind of think maybe we ought to do nothing unless you have some real bad trouble tomorrow.
081:13:39|T|LMP|Like if we can't get it zipped.
081:14:07|T|CDR|Okay. Can we use my pliers on it to pull the zipper closed?
081:14:53|T|CDR|Houston. Houston, 16. Do you read? Over.
081:14:55|C|Har|Roger. Reading you 5 by 5, John. Go ahead.
081:15:03|T|CDR|Okay. If I have trouble closing it, can I use my pliers to get a better grip on it to pull it closed? Because it took me the better part of 20 minutes the other day to do it, and it usually takes about two. There's a place on there in the small of Charlie's back where that thing has just separated too far apart on the restraint zipper for me to pull it closed easily. When he gets on the LCG, the FCS, and the UCD bulk in there, the suit is going to be farther apart than it was - yesterday.
081:16:03|C|Har|John, we talked to Dave about that, and he said the big problem is that you can't arch your back in zero g as well. He had - he had a lot of trouble too, but on the Moon in one-sixth g he had no problem at all, because the gravity helped him arch his back. Does that sound like the problem - you just couldn't get arched back that far enough to do it?
081:16:30|T|CDR|Got me there. It looked like he was arched as much as he usually is.
081:16:46|T|CDR|But you're saying that if I can't do it in - in zero g, we go on down to the Moon and try it in one-sixth g?
081:17:00|C|Har|Roger. That sounds pretty good, John. We - we did look at a backup procedure here, but it's a long - looks like a long thing and involves using a needle and pulling things together like you're sewing.
081:17:43|T|LMP|Okay, Hank. I think to give us every benefit of the doubt that I will not - I don't plan to wear the - the FCS probably tomorrow, and I'll just use the LCG and UCD.
081:18:07|C|Har|Roger. Understand, and could you give us Auto on - the high gain.
081:18:16|T|LMP|There you go.
081:19:28|T|LMP|Hank, also we would like to get permission to fill the drink bags tonight to save a few minutes also, if you think that's gonna be all right.
081:19:43|C|Har|Roger. That - Go ahead and do that, Charlie.
081:19:48|T|LMP|All right.
081:20:31|C|Har|Ken, we can't find any connection between the Pan Camera and Main Bus A, and we were wondering - Main Bus B, and we were wondering if, when you got the second momentary one - undervolt - were you moving any switches at that time?
081:20:49|T|CMP|That's negative.
081:21:13|T|CMP|They were both momentary Main Bus undervolts.
081:21:24|C|Har|Roger. The - the first one was momentary also?
081:21:31|T|CMP|It - it could be, or it could be that the sensor is triggering at the wrong level. It could be that the sensor shifted up to something that looks reasonable. I wouldn't object - we still got the Pan Camera power on - I wouldn't object to ... it to operate for a second and back off - go ahead and use a couple of frames just to let you watch it.
081:21:54|C|Har|Stand by, Ken.
081:23:29|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
081:23:30|C|Har|Go ahead.
081:23:34|T|LMP|Is Tom satisfied with his Glycol Evap Out? We've got off scale, high here.
081:23:59|C|Har|Stand by. Stand by a minute, Charlie.
081:24:21|C|Har|16, Houston. You're ... is at the top of the scale. You're still okay. You should now monitor Rad Out.
081:24:32|T|LMP|A Rad Out is 75.
081:24:36|C|Har|Roger.
081:28:17|C|Har|16, Houston. Talked with the suit people, and they don't want you using the pliers on the zippers.
081:28:31|T|CDR|I just used it to get a better grip with, not to pull the zipper, just to pull with.
081:28:54|C|Har|Their concern is over side load, John. They're afraid for you to use the pliers.
081:29:06|T|CDR|Okay.
081:29:34|C|Har|Ken, Houston. We would like to talk to you a minute about this docking latch, if you're free.
081:29:45|T|CMP|Go ahead.
081:29:48|C|Har|Okay. We've got a real long procedure here. I don't think you need to copy it all down. Let me just read it through to you once, and kind of let me discuss it as we go. What we want to do is kind of get a look at the thing tomorrow and see what the condition of it is. After you disconnect the LM umbilical, we want - would like for you to open the orange LM umbilical connector cover and inspect the roller pawl. The roller pawl, we hope, is engaged in the detent, but we would like to find out if it's in the detent, or is it free, or sticking up, and you can do that by looking in the side of the latch after you remove that umbilical connector cover. Is there any question on that?
081:30:38|T|CMP|Yeah. I'm not sure I know what you're looking for.
081:30:42|C|Har|Okay, when you look in the side there -
081:30:45|T|CMP|- I'm not at all sure what the roller pawl is.
081:30:46|C|Har|Okay, the roller pawl is on the far left side of the latch, behind and above the Auxiliary Release Button. And it can be identified by the roller on the tip of the pawl. The pawl is just a little arm that sticks out, and it's got a little roller on the end of it that rides on the cam that has these detents in it.
081:31:05|T|CMP|Okay.
081:31:08|T|CMP|Do you want to do this before we unlock it?
081:31:12|C|Har|That's affirmative. And it best be done tomorrow - before you get your helmet and gloves on, of course. Just take a look at it while - perhaps while they're bringing the LM up. And if you find after we get the condition of that, if the roller is down in the detent like we suspect that it is, when you remove the yellow probe umbilical cover on the right side of the latch, we would like you to look in the right side in there and at the bungee bell crank mechanism, and see if there's any foreign-object damage or anything wedged up in there.
081:31:51|T|CMP|When you say remove the cover - do you mean physically remove it from the spacecraft, or just open it up and look underneath it?
081:31:57|C|Har|Just open it up and look under there, Ken. And this is mainly - these two steps is just an inspection. We'd just like to verify the condition of the roller pawl and also the bell crank mechanism on the other side. Has nothing to do with the latch, but at least it'll give us an idea of what's wrong inside, if there is anything. It's not gonna help you in any way to prepare for unlocking it. To unlock it - after you've looked at these two things, we would like to know if the latch handle requires force to cock the latch on the first stroke - and the second stroke, if required. In other words, if the handle comes away real easy, as you recall, then the thing is already cocked. More than likely, it is gonna take some force, and we would like to verify how this works. And if it should require force, pull it down, and then we want to see that the hook comes out there inboard approximately 16 degrees. If the hook doesn't come out, then all you got to do is pull down on the handle to the full cock position, and hold it, and then just reach up and grab the hook, and pull it inboard about 16 degrees, and the hook should stay there. And then you just proceed with normal undocking.
081:33:20|T|CMP|Okay. So the kind of thing you want me to look for are information only. Is that affirmative?
081:33:27|C|Har|Right. It would help the guys down here to try to understand what - what really happened to the latch. We kind of suspect it only got one cock. But if you look in there, and look for the roller pawl on the left side and look at the bell crank on the right side, at least that would tell us that nothing is jamming it, and that the roller pawl is in the right direction - right place. Operationally though, prepare for undocking. What it really amounts to, you just use the normal procedure. You pull the latch handle down and cock it if necessary, and if the hook doesn't come back, just hold the latch handle all the way down to the full cock position and pull the hook back.
081:34:20|T|CMP|Okay. I just wanted to keep in mind what it was I needed if the time gets crowded.
081:34:26|C|Har|Roger. The only this is - if there is any question on cocking, the only thing you have to do there is just pull it down and get the hook out of the way. Do you have any questions on any of that?
081:34:48|T|CMP|Ah, Hank, we just ...
081:34:54|T|CMP|Not - not right now. Maybe you want to get in there and look at it. I'll call and ask you for some clarification or something tomorrow. But I think I know what you mean.
081:35:01|C|Har|Okay.
081:35:12|T|LMP|Hank, as we came up towards the landing site, in that terrain - the general terrain to the east of us appears to me to be frothy vesicular-looking type terrain, real ... looking at this scale. Over.
081:35:33|C|Har|Roger. We copy, Charlie.
081:35:38|T|LMP|I'd say that was the Descartes. It has that appearance to it to me.
081:35:45|C|Har|Roger.
081:35:51|T|LMP|And do you have this LM DAP load for us and TEI?
081:35:57|C|Har|Roger. We're working on those PADs now.
081:36:13|C|Har|Charlie, we'd like to get a Bat B charge going.
081:36:22|T|LMP|Okay, Bat B charge going on.
081:36:39|T|LMP|Bat B is charging.
081:37:16|C|Har|16, Houston. I have your TEI-12, 19 block data.
081:37:27|T|LMP|Okay, stand by.
081:37:59|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
081:38:04|C|Har|Okay. TEI-12, SPS/G&amp;N; 39817; plus 0.61, plus 1.19, 097:45:53.09; plus 3163.2, plus 1040.3, minus 0234.6; 181, 080, 020. Rest of the PAD is NA.

081:40:23|C|Har|Good readback. And are you ready for TEI-19?
081:40:31|T|LMP|You speak.
081:40:33|C|Har|Roger. TEI-19, SPS/G&amp;N; 39445; plus 0.61, plus 1.15; 111:31:49.81; plus 2909.4, plus 0785.3, minus 0224.0; 181, 100, 017; Set stars same as DOI, two jets, 17 seconds. Other: burn undocked, assumes circ LM to Moon at T<sub>ig</sub> minus 160.09. End of Pad. If you'll give us Accept, we're ready to uplink.
081:42:06|T|LMP|Roger. You have it. And readback TEI-19, SPS/G&amp;N; 39445; plus 0.61, 1.15; 111:31:49.81; plus, 2909.4, plus 0785.3, minus 0224.0; 181, 100, 017. Sirius and Rigel; two jets, 17 seconds; burn undock, assume circ; LM to at T<sub>ig</sub> minus 166.09.
081:42:38|C|Har|That was 160.09.
081:42:46|T|LMP|Roger.
081:43:15|T|CMP|Henry, can I assume that the Mission Timer is in sufficient sync and that we don't need to do any updates there and that the REFSMMAT is good as is?
081:43:28|C|Har|That's affirmative.
081:43:32|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
081:43:46|T|CDR|Have you got the LM DAP stuff, Hank?
081:43:50|C|Har|Roger. We've got it and we're up-linking now and we're also loading your EMP 509 and I have your DAP, if you're ready to copy.
081:44:01|T|LMP|Go ahead.
081:44:02|C|Har|Correction on that. It's not 509; it's the jet monitor. Okay, LM DAP. LM weight, 36673; CSM weight, 39329. Checklist: DPS gimbal trims are good; no trim required.
081:44:28|T|LMP|Roger. Reading 36673, 39329, and the gimbals are good as is.
081:44:38|C|Har|A good readback, Charlie. I have a change to your LM Timeline Book on Page 1.
081:44:52|T|LMP|Stand by. Is it the Timeline or Activation?
081:44:55|C|Har|Timeline Book.
081:45:09|C|Har|It's a change to your undocking attitude, Charlie. It says Timeline Book.
081:45:20|T|LMP|Okay - okay, just had to get it out. Go ahead, Page 1.
081:45:26|C|Har|Okay, change undocking attitude to 0, 284, 064.
081:45:43|C|Har|The reason for this is because of the docking index angle -
081:45:45|T|LMP|Roger; 0, 280 ... - Roger; 0, 284, 064.
081:45:54|C|Har|Roger. That's because of your docking index angle of minus 3-1/2 degrees.
081:46:01|T|LMP|Copy.
081:46:07|C|Har|And I have some Flight Plan changes for you.
081:47:07|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We'd like to verify the position of the O<sub>2</sub> Tank 50-Watt Heaters on Panel 226.
081:47:17|T|LMP|They are open.
081:47:19|C|Har|Roger. Copy. They're open.
081:47:45|C|Har|Charlie, are you ready to copy the Flight Plan changes?
081:47:52|T|CMP|What kind of Flight Plan, LM or CSM type?
081:47:54|C|Har|Roger. They're CSM, if you want to get them, Ken, they're for tomorrow's activities.
081:48:04|T|CMP|Okay, I'm ready.
081:48:06|C|Har|Okay, the first one is at 96:34.
081:48:23|T|CMP|Go ahead.
081:48:24|C|Har|Okay, there's a Verb 48 there. Change R-1 to read "10102.
081:48:40|T|CMP|Okay, "10102" for Verb 48, R-1 at 96:34.
081:48:45|C|Har|That's correct. At 96:39, write in "Load EMP 509; leave on through gimbal drive check for circ.
081:49:23|T|CMP|Okay, at 39, "Load 509 and leave through circ gimbal drive check.
081:49:29|C|Har|That's correct. The next change is at 97:15.
081:49:37|T|CMP|Go.
081:49:38|C|Har|Delete the Verb 48.
081:49:49|T|CMP|Okay, deleted the Verb 48 at 97:15; and that's because we'd already set it; affirmative?
081:49:55|C|Har|That's affirmative. And that also prevents you from activating that Saturn DAP. Okay, at 97:44, right after - right be - prior to the Verb 49 maneuver there, put in "Load DAP, Verb 48 (10101)(X1111).
081:50:40|T|CMP|Okay. You want to "Load Verb 48 (10101) and (X1111)." After the circ burn and ahead of the Verb 49 maneuver.
081:50:51|C|Har|That's affirmative and, Ken, the computer's yours; the E-memory program's loaded.
081:50:58|T|CMP|All right, sir; thank you.
081:51:01|C|Har|Okay, next change is at 98:32. Prior to the comm check there, put "Load EMP 509.
081:51:22|C|Har|...
081:51:23|T|CMP|Okay, prior to comm check, "Load 509.
081:51:26|C|Har|Roger. And down about 98:44 after P00, add "Terminate EMP 509, after the P24 is complete.
081:51:50|T|CMP|Okay, I'll terminate 509 between P00 and loading Verb 48.
081:51:56|C|Har|Roger. The next change is at 100 hours 32 minutes, "Load EMP 509.
081:52:14|T|CMP|Okay, at about 100:32, "Load 509.
081:52:18|C|Har|Roger. And about 100:43, "Terminate EMP 509, after P24 complete.
081:52:41|T|CMP|Okay, will terminate 509 after P24.
081:52:46|C|Har|Okay, Ken, that's it on the Flight Plan changes, I hate to bring this up again, but they've got a change here for your SPS burn cue card.
081:53:02|T|CMP|All right. What might that be?
081:53:06|C|Har|Well, we had this - starting this thing 20 minutes early before so that we could help you prior to LOS and we're convinced that you don't really need Tape that much time, and what we think you ought to do is get the gimbal drive test started - you know, the Main Buses on about eight minutes early rather than six minutes. So the change is to - where we had you 40 minutes or minus 20 minutes is to change that to 52 and minus eight.
081:53:41|T|CMP|Okay. Do I dare use my ink pen this time?
081:53:45|C|Har|I hope it's good for the rest of the burns now, if we change that to 52 minutes and minus eight minutes.
081:53:56|T|CMP|Okay, that's no sweat. Thank you.
081:53:59|C|Har|Okay, and the next one'll become 41 minutes and minus - Correction, 53 minutes and minus seven.
081:54:10|T|CMP|Okay, 53 and minus seven and 52 and minus eight.
081:54:15|C|Har|Okay, now, earlier we had deleted that "Tape Recorder, High Bit Rate" line there and added it back on the back page, and I guess now we need to move it back.
081:54:35|T|CMP|Okay, would you settle for minus eight, so I can just leave it where it is?
081:54:39|C|Har|Roger; that's good enough. Just do it there and delete it from the back - back side of the card.
081:54:47|T|CMP|Okay, we'll do that.
081:55:31|T|CMP|Hank, are we going to end up with temperatures that are low enough, or would you like for me to manually set this Temp In valve to a little lower temperature?
081:55:44|C|Har|Are you talking about the Oxidizer pressure, Ken?
081:55:50|T|CMP|No, sir; the manual Temp In and the glycol loop.
081:55:53|C|Har|Oh, that - EECOM advises that looks pretty good now.
081:56:01|T|CMP|Okay, is it going to get too cold on the - on the dark side?
081:56:13|C|Har|Stand by a minute.
081:56:32|C|Har|Ken, EECOM says that the present setting should keep you in good shape.
081:57:06|T|CMP|Hank, I guess I'd - I would like to run it cooler to get the cockpit a little cooler, if that isn't going to cause any other problems.
081:57:19|C|Har|Stand by a minute, Ken.
081:58:28|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We'd like to get the Pan Camera turned off.
081:58:34|T|CMP|Okay, you just want to take - turn the power off, huh?
081:58:39|C|Har|Roger, we were trying to look at - run it, but we got pretty high loads on the spacecraft now, and we're getting close to LOS and there's not going to be time to exercise it.
081:58:52|T|CMP|Okay, we'll just turn it off then.
081:59:16|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, we've got the Pan Camera Power, Off.
081:59:20|C|Har|Roger, Ken. And did you happen to notice the retract time on the Mapping Camera.
081:59:27|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I meant to get that in. That was - I thought it was excessive. In fact, I thought it had maybe stuck. It was about three minutes.
081:59:38|C|Har|Roger; we copy.
081:59:55|T|CMP|And, Hank, I got some - some film status to give you, if you're ready for that.
082:00:02|C|Har|Stand by.
082:00:12|C|Har|Go ahead.
082:00:17|T|CMP|Say again.
082:00:19|C|Har|I'm ready to copy, Ken.
082:00:25|T|CMP|Okay. On Magazine Victor, we're up to frame number 8; Sierra Sierra, frame number 13; Tango Tango, 04. November November, 36.
082:00:49|C|Har|Roger; copy. Victor, 8; Sierra Sierra, 13; Tango Tango, 04; November November, 36.
082:01:00|T|CMP|That's correct, sir.
082:04:01|C|Har|16, Houston. To more evenly distribute the - the electrical loads when you get on the back side after LOS, we'd like you to take Telcom Group 2 to AC1.
082:04:17|T|CMP|Okay, Telcom Group 2 to AC1.
082:04:22|C|Har|Roger; that's after LOS. And in regard to the Mixing Valve, you can adjust that for an Evap Out temperature of 49 degrees, and you ought to be okay.
082:04:37|T|CMP|Okay, is that 49 degrees the coldest temperature? Or just how did you -
082:04:46|C|Har|If you adjust it right now to an Evap Out of 49 -
082:04:51|T|CMP|Okay, okay. Right now for 49.
082:06:07|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We'd like to get an E-Mod, if we can.
082:06:27|T|LMP|On the way.
082:06:29|C|Har|Roger.
082:06:54|C|Har|And 16, Houston. Make sure you get the comm set up right in your presleep checklist here, or INCO says they won't be able to command the thing right and we'll have to wake you up next time.
082:07:11|T|CMP|Say again, Hank.
082:07:15|C|Har|Roger. They're admonishing me to tell you to be sure you follow the checklist on setting up the comm presleep.
082:07:27|T|CMP|Roger. We'll do that.
082:08:24|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS.
082:08:24|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've lost radio contact now with the spacecraft as it passes behind the Moon on the fourth revolution. The crew is scheduled to begin a nine hour rest period while on the backside of the Moon, and we would expect to hear no further word from them until the end of that rest period. During this frontside pass on the fourth revolution, there were three major items covered. I'll try to run through those three, and summarize what to us appeared to be the major points. On first reacquiring contact, John Young reported that they had seen two Main Bus B undervolt conditions - as he described it these were transitory events Main Bus B voltage dropping briefly to the point to where it triggered a Master Caution and Warning alarm. Normally, Main Bus B, which is one of two Main Buses supplying electrical power to the equipment aboard the Command and Service Module, operates at about 27 to 28 volts under load. The Master Caution and Warning is set to trigger at 26.25 volts, if the voltage drops to that level. And in replaying the data tapes, we saw the voltage drop to about 26.14 volts. The data tape replay, however, showed no indication of a problem with any of the electrical equipment. One sometimes suspects momentary current overloads -- a heavy drain of current which would then drag the voltage down, but there was no indication that any of the equipment was malfunctioning. The one thing the crew described that appeared to be coincident with the.voltage drop, was the operation of the Pan Camera. However, simultaneous data on this camera, when it was operating, showed that the camera was functioning normally. At this point after looking at all of the data, and considering the loads on both Main Bus A and Main Bus B, one supposition is that we had a coincident series of events, which momentarily overloaded Main Bus B. Such things as heaters coming on simultaneously at the same time we had a heavy current drain for the SIM bay activities. If this is, in fact, the case, it can easily be remedied by transferring some of the load to Main Bus A - a simple re-configuration. And that appears to be the most likely cause of the Main Bus undervoltages, in which case we would have no particular problem. One other thing that was discussed, was the suit problem. Going back to the beginning of this one - Charlie Duke reported last night on entering the Lunar Module suited - getting suited up and getting into the Lunar Module that John Young [sic - it was actually Charlie Duke himself that had experienced the problems] had some difficulty getting the suit zipped. The restraint zipper closed across the back of the suit - this zipper does not maintain the pressure of the suit, but is a load carrying zipper that holds all the layers together on the outside of the pressure layers. And Duke mentioned in order to minimize the problem of getting the suit zipped tomorrow, he would like to leave off the Fecal Containment System. In zipping the suit up the first time both the Fecal Containment System and the Liquid Cool[ed] Garment were not worn. Duke's feeling was that once these additional items were added underneath the suit it would increase the problem of closing that zipper. And we gave him a go ahead to leave the fecal containment system off, and recommend that he make an attempt to get the suit zipped using the normal procedures. John Young suggested the possibility of using a pair of pliers that they carry on board to assist in it, a recommendation at this time is that not be done. Dave Scott, who was by earlier in the evening, discussed with the flight controllers a similar problem that they encountered, although apparently not quite so severe, on Apollo 15. And Dave's analysis of that situation was that in zero G it's more difficult to arch one's back without gravity to help. Arching the back is a method that is used to reduce the strain across the zipper so that it is easier to get it closed, and it was suggested to Charlie that he make every effort to brace himself and get the back arched in order to make the job a little easier of getting the zipper closed. And we do have a backup procedure that'll be discussed with the crew to assist in closing that zipper. If the problem arises tomorrow when they're preparing to get into the Lunar Module and suiting up. Also CapCom Henry Hartsfield discussed a procedure with Ken Mattingly for checking out the docking latches. One of the 12 docking latches has apparently not latched down firmly onto the LM tunnel docking ring. This causes no particular concern, but there is some interest in determining why the latch did not close. Mattingly, last night, was asked to cycle a device that is connected with the latch. This gave the flight controllers an indication that the latch, which is cocked prior to docking, was not fully cocked, and therefore, did not latch fully. There is also the possibility that the latch is broken. In order to determine which of these is the case, Mattingly was given a series of procedures to follow, of which we hope will provide some information and shed some light on whether the latch simply was not fully cocked, or whether it is broken or has malfunctioned in some other way. This is primarily of concern for future flights. It doesn't have a direct bearing on this flight, it's felt that the latch will in no way effect undocking and since only three of the 12 latches are required for a firm hard docking, there is no particular concern that it will in any way effect the docking either. As mentioned previously, we expect to see the crew asleep when next we reacquire the spacecraft. That will be about 40 minutes. And as Apollo 16 went around the corner on the fourth revolution, we showed it in an orbit of 58.7 by 10.4 nautical miles [108.7 by 19.3 kilometres]. At 82 hours, 19 minutes into the flight of Apollo 16, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

This causes no particular concern, but there is some interest in determining why the latch did not close. Mattingly, last night, was asked to cycle a device that is connected with the latch. This gave the flight controllers an indication that the latch, which is cocked prior to docking, was not fully cocked, and therefore, did not latch fully. There is also the possibility that the latch is broken. In order to determine which of these is the case, Mattingly was given a series of procedures to follow, of which we hope will provide some information and shed some light on whether the latch simply was not fully cocked, or whether it is broken or has malfunctioned in some other way. This is primarily of concern for future flights. It doesn't have a direct bearing on this flight, it's felt that the latch will in no way effect undocking and since only three of the 12 latches are required for a firm hard docking, there is no particular concern that it will in any way effect the docking either. As mentioned previously, we expect to see the crew asleep when next we reacquire the spacecraft. That will be about 40 minutes. And as Apollo 16 went around the corner on the fourth revolution, we showed it in an orbit of 58.7 by 10.4 nautical miles [108.7 by 19.3 kilometres]. At 82 hours, 19 minutes into the flight of Apollo 16, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

091:26:25|T|CMP|How you down there this morning, Houston?
091:26:27|C|Pet|Just fine. How are you, 16?
091:26:35|T|CMP|Charging hard.
091:26:37|C|Pet|Roger. Got about three short items and a SIM bay status, if you're ready.
091:26:50|T|CMP|Okay. Can we hold off on the SIM bay status? And I'll copy your three short items.
091:26:55|C|Pet|Roger.
091:26:58|C|Pet|Okay. The first one is - based on our evaluation, your potassium levels are running a little low, and we'd like to recommend that you drink some orange juice this morning. Also, you've got a long day ahead of you, so we'd like to recommend that you eat a bit more food. Second item is terminate Battery Bravo charge. The third item is terminate the jet-on monitor.
091:27:53|T|CMP|Okay, Don.
091:28:02|T|CMP|Okay, Don. Number one, I understand your comment about the potassium low and all that jazz. We've just finished up breakfast, and I think we've eaten almost everything that the LMies have to eat. And we - we've been drinking all the drinks every day. And, if we get a chance, we'll try to get some more - get another juice bag out. We will terminate the Battery B charge and terminate the Jet Monitor, and I understand the way to do the Jet Monitor is - I'll go to - I'll go to the SCS mode and key a Verb 37 Noun 20 and then verify that Noun 26 isn't all zeros again. And I can go back to P20. is that correct?
091:28:55|C|Pet|Stand by one.
091:29:02|C|Pet|There's no requirement to go to SCS, 16.
091:29:09|T|CMP|Okay. I can just call [Verb] 37 [Noun] 20 without getting any firings?
091:31:10|C|Pet|16, just to be sure we're talking the same thing - to kill the jet-on Monitor, we want to do a Verb 37 Enter, 30 Enter, a Verb 37 Enter, 20 Enter and zero the Noun 26.
091:32:05|T|CMP|Don, I can't get to the Updates Book where that's written down. Would you read it to me slowly, and I'll do that terminate right now.
091:32:11|C|Pet|Okay, it's Verb 37 Enter, 30 Enter, Verb 37 Enter, 20 Enter, zero the Noun 26.
091:32:31|C|Pet|And, 16, you're about one minute to LOS, and you're looking good.
091:32:39|T|CMP|Okay. And we're taking an extra orange with potassium this morning.
091:32:43|C|Pet|Roger.
091:33:06|T|CMP|Houston, 16. Take a look at that biomed off of me and see how it looks. Over.
091:33:14|C|Pet|Okay.
091:33:20|T|CMP|I got it reset - from yesterday.
091:33:28|C|Pet|Ken, still looks a little loose.
091:33:35|T|CMP|Well, it's not loose.
091:33:40|C|Pet|We'll have to take a better look at it next time around, Ken.
091:33:48|T|CDR|Okay. This is John, and the sensors are fixed.
091:34:01|C|Pet|We've got confusion down here on who we're monitoring, John.
091:34:42|C|Pet|John, the lead we're concerned with is the sternal lead - the one on your breastbone. You might jiggle it a little bit.
091:35:05|T|CDR|Gee, we're doing that. It sure looks like it's all tight.
091:35:09|C|Pet|Okay.
091:35:35|C|Pet|John, you might try putting new sponges on that lead.
091:35:43|T|CDR|Okay. I did that last night.

092:29:46|T|CMP|Hello, Jim.
092:29:47|C|Irw|Morning.
092:29:49|T|CMP|We're in the process of a little suit donning here, and we've got one problem. I went to retract the mass spectrometer, and the gamma ray boom came in fine, but the mass spectrometer boom indicates to barber pole and has stayed barber pole about ten minutes. I went ahead and enabled the jets. And I'd like for you to take a look at the - at the - telemetry talkback on the boom, and see if you can suggest something for me to do.
092:30:15|C|Irw|Okay, we copy.
092:30:16|T|CMP|Barber pole. It's a total barber pole.
092:30:18|C|Irw|We copy, Ken.
092:30:20|T|CMP|Okay.
092:31:19|C|Irw|16, this is Houston. We're wondering if you've gone through the malfunction procedure for that Boom Retraction on page 1-24 of the Systems Handbook?
092:31:31|T|CMP|Well, I looked and didn't find one that was appropriate.
092:31:35|C|Irw|Okay. I guess you're right, Ken.
092:31:48|T|CMP|We're pretty busy, as you knows Jim: and so I'd really appreciate it if you could talk me through whatever steps you want.
092:31:53|C|Irw|Okay; understand.
092:32:30|C|Irw|16, this is Houston. We'd like you to put the Mass Spec Boom switch to the Off position. That's if it's not there already.
092:32:39|T|CMP|Okay. And when I do, it goes to gray.
092:32:45|C|Irw|Understand, it goes to gray.
092:32:52|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
092:35:00|C|Irw|16, this is Houston. We had understood that you had activated all your RCS jets. We show you still in the SIM bay configuration.
092:35:19|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you. I have the switches with the circuit breakers I had left out.
092:35:25|C|Irw|Roger.
092:35:38|C|Irw|16, this is Houston. You can go normal acquisition procedures on the S-band.
092:35:45|T|CMP|Okay.
092:36:19|T|CMP|Jim, what did you want me to do with that high gain?
092:36:24|C|Irw|We wanted you to go through normal acquisition procedures.
092:37:19|C|Irw|16, will you go Auto on the high gain?
092:37:26|T|CMP|You have it.
092:37:29|C|Irw|Okay.
092:38:14|C|Irw|Six - Never mind.
092:38:46|C|Irw|Okay, 16. This is Houston. We have SIM bay data now. Will you go back to Retract on the - on the Boom switch?
092:38:59|T|CMP|Okay. You have Retract, Jim.
092:39:10|C|Irw|Roger.
092:40:09|C|Irw|16, this is Houston. Will you check the talkback on that boom, and tell us whether it's full barber pole or a partial?
092:40:22|T|CMP|It's the same as it's been, Jim. It's a barber pole, full.
092:40:27|C|Irw|Okays we copy; a full barber pole. We show it partially retracted within acceptable limits.
092:40:38|T|CMP|What do you mean partially retracted? Does that mean your telemetry point has cinched closure?
092:40:44|C|Irw|That's affirmative.
092:40:49|T|CMP|Okay, then I'll put it back into the Off position?
092:40:53|C|Irw|Stand by, Ken. I think we - we want it in Retract.
092:40:59|T|CMP|Okay, I'll leave it in Retract.
092:41:04|C|Irw|Okay, you could put the Retract switch back to the Off position.
092:41:14|T|CMP|Okay, Retract is Off.
092:41:16|C|Irw|Roger.
092:41:19|T|CMP|If you can watch that thing on telemetry, I can extend it enough to clear it and then try a Retract again.
092:41:30|C|Irw|Okay, let's - We're within limits, Ken. Let's hold what we have.
092:41:39|T|CMP|Okay.
092:43:47|T|CMP|Okay, Jim. On the docking latch number 10, I've got some observations, if you're ready.
092:43:56|C|Irw|Roger. We're ready, Ken. Go ahead.
092:44:01|T|CMP|Okay, when I look in under the LM umbilical connector cover, the roller cam looks normal, and everything I can see from that side looks correct. When I look under the cover on the right side - that's the probe connector cover - I look at the bungee in the - the little arm that sticks out from the bottom of the cam - when I compare it to another latch, it doesn't stick out as far; in fact, the back of this part - this inner piece of the bell crank - I can get the part number on it, and it's - it's flush; whereas, on the other end, it sticks out and it shows the pin; so it looks like it hasn't come over center. Sorry I don't have the right part nomenclature.
092:44:51|C|Irw|Roger; we copy.
092:44:52|T|CMP|If you had a docking latch on the table there, somewhere, you could see what I'm looking at.
092:45:33|C|Irw|Ken, this is Houston. Can you see anything that might be obstructing or interfering with that cam action?
092:45:42|T|CMP|No, sir; I can't.
092:45:44|C|Irw|Okay.
092:46:28|C|Irw|Okay, 16; this is Houston. if you go to P00 and Accept, we'll up-link you. Okay, just Accept.

092:59:39|T|CMP|Houston, from my present positions I can't be sure exactly where I am because I just looked out the window again but - we passed over a large crater, and it has three little domes in the bottom of it with craters in the top of them; and they look like very subtle cinder cones. I'll try to mark that guy on the way back. It's one of a cluster of two large ones and several smaller ones.

094:23:06|T|LMP|Hello, Houston. Ole Orion; how do you read? Over.
094:23:09|T|CapCom|Orion, this is Houston. Read you loud and clear.
094:23:14|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. We're zipping right on through the checklist. We've got the PGNS up, the docked coarse align done, the landing gear's deployed, and the only thing we haven't done is really what you need to see. And we're ready to start in on the S-Band checks and bring up the steerable. Over.
094:23:34|T|CapCom|Okay, Charlie.
094:23:43|T|LMP|Okay, while guidance is - Let me give you some angles. We had a Verb 06 Noun 20 that was done at 94:20:20. The LM angles were plus 29465, plus 28996, plus 35502.
094:24:13|T|CapCom|Roger; we copy. Copied the LM as plus 29465, plus 28996, plus 35502. Over.
094:24:25|T|LMP|That's affirmative. The Command Module are plus 00269, plus 10931, plus 00472. Over.
094:24:37|T|CapCom|Roger. I copied plus 00269, plus 10931, plus 00470 [sic]. Over.
094:24:48|T|LMP|That's firm. It sounds like we've got good comm on Primary S-band and T/R and Secondary Power Amp. I'm going Secondary S-Band T/R and Primary Power Amp. Over.
094:25:00|T|CapCom|Roger. We're standing by.
094:25:04|T|LMP|Okay. I think it's my switch you're doing.
094:25:08|T|CDR|Huh? Yeah, it is. Carry on.
094:25:13|T|CapCom|Casper, this is Houston. We want narrow on the S-band.
094:25:46|T|CDR|Is that affirmative?
094:25:47|T|LMP|Yeah, you can go ahead ... Okay, Jim; how do you read? Over.
094:25:58|T|CapCom|Orion, this is Houston. Go ahead.
094:26:03|T|LMP|How do you read, Jim? Over.
094:26:05|T|CapCom|I read you, but there's a lot of noise in the background.
094:26:15|T|LMP|Okay. We have Primary Evap activation time as 93:33:30; and we're standing by for the AGS abort constants. Over. Or -
094:26:27|T|CapCom|Roger -
094:26:28|T|LMP|- let's do the steerable first and get - and get you the down-link off the E-memory dump. Over.
094:26:36|T|CapCom|Okay. We're standing by for the steerable.
094:26:48|T|CapCom|Casper, this is Houston. Will you go Auto?
094:25:03|T|CDR|We've got a lot ...
094:28:24|T|CapCom|Casper, this is Houston. How do you read?
094:28:30|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
094:28:31|T|CapCom|Roger, Casper. I have a PIPA bias update for you.
094:29:18|T|CapCom|Orion, this is Houston. We want you to go Low Bit Rate and then bring up the High Gain.
094:29:30|T|LMP|Okay.
094:29:46|T|CapCom|Orion, this is Houston. The pitch should be 99 on the steerable.
094:30:18|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. We got the aft Omni, I can't - when I move the yaw drive, the yaw indicator does not move on the steerable, and I do not hear any grinding noise. Over.
094:30:34|T|CapCom|Roger, I copy no response on the yaw drive.
094:30:41|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
094:30:42|T|CapCom|Roger. if you're ready, Charlie, I'll read you the AGS abort constants.
094:30:49|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
094:30:50|T|CapCom|Okay, 224 beginning: plus 60511, plus 29419, plus 60383, plus 00565, minus 32776, minus 54412. Over.
094:31:21|T|LMP|Roger. Copy, starting with 224: 60511, 29419, 60383, 00565, 3 - minus 32776, 54412. Over.
094:31:41|T|CapCom|Okay. On 673, it was minus 54412.
094:31:49|T|LMP|Roger. That's what I got - minus 54412.
094:31:54|T|CapCom|Good readback.
094:33:00|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
094:33:02|T|CapCom|Go ahead, Orion.
094:33:06|T|LMP|Okay. I can't seem to get the yaw out of the stowed position, minus 12 on the indicator, and I cannot hear it drive when I move this dial - just like the - in pitch I can hear it drive and the needle follows. Over.
094:33:20|T|CapCom|I - We read you, Charlie. We want you to go through a little procedure here to essentially get you back to a start position. We want you to go to Slew on the S-Band. Check both S-Band circuit breakers on 11 and 16. Select Pitch of minus 75 and Yaw of minus 12: wait 30 seconds and then go to an acquisition and we'll have some angles for you.
094:33:47|T|LMP|Okay, that's where we are.
094:34:27|T|CapCom|Casper, this is Houston. Go to Accept. And, Orion, the angles for your S-band are Pitch of 99 and Yaw of 16.
094:34:47|T|LMP|Copy. 99 and 16.
094:34:51|T|CapCom|And, Casper, this is Houston. I have that PIPA bias for you whenever you're ready to copy.
094:35:02|T|LMP|Go ahead.
094:35:04|T|CapCom|Okay, on the PIPA bias: Address 1454, Data 03521; Address 1456, Data 76274. Over.
094:35:25|T|CMP|Okay, Address 1454, 03521; Address 1456, 76274.
094:35:36|T|CapCom|Okay, on the 1456, couldn't hear your readback, Ken. The data is 76274.
094:35:45|T|CMP|Roger; 76274.
094:35:50|T|CapCom|Sounded like a good readback.
094:35:57|T|CapCom|And, Casper, this is Houston with a DAP load for you whenever you' re ready.
094:36:19|T|CMP|Go ahead.
094:36:34|T|CMP|Go ahead, Jim.
094:36:43|T|CapCom|Casper, this is Houston. We're finished with the computer.
094:36:50|T|CMP|Okay, I'm in Block, and I'm standing by.
094:36:57|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
094:37:15|T|CapCom|Orion, this is Houston. Will you select Down Voice Backup -
094:37:17|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
094:37:40|T|LMP|Voice Backup. How do you read?
094:37:49|T|CapCom|Roger. We're reading you but still excessive noise down here.
094:37:51|T|LMP|Okay. Was it as noisy on the other transmitter receiver and power amp?
094:37:59|T|CapCom|I think it was about the same, Charlie.
094:38:05|T|LMP|Okay, be advised - we went through the steerable Step 2 on Page 3-62, and the yaw still does not indicate that it's moving, and we cannot hear a grind. Though, with those angles, I get a - that I got of 99 and minus 12, I get a signal strength of greater than 3. I went Track Mode to Auto and Up-Link - and when I went Track Mode to Auto, it sounded like the thing is setting up there just constantly oscillating and the - the pitch needle varies plus or minus 10. The signal strength stays pretty constant. In fact, no matter what position I select on the S-Band antenna, the signal strength stays up around 38 or so.
094:38:59|T|CapCom|Roger; we copy.
094:39:04|T|LMP|Okay. Could we press on with the Aft Omni in that configuration? Over.
094:39:12|T|CapCom|Yeah, let's press on.
094:39:16|T|LMP|Okay. Can you get an E-memory dump? We're ready for the E-memory dump.
094:39:22|T|CapCom|Stand by one.
094:39:30|T|CapCom|Okay, let's bypass that because we need high bit rate.
094:39:38|T|LMP|Okay. You can't get high bit rate on the omni?
094:39:43|T|CapCom|Not until we get to the - 210 up.
094:39:50|T|LMP|Okay. You will bypass the Up-Link and we'll go on and do the - the Ascent Battery checkout.
094:40:01|T|CapCom|Okay, we're ready for the battery checkout.
094:40:02|T|CDR|Okay. Is it okay to do the P52 without - Okay to do the P52 as soon as we get into darkness here?
094:40:31|T|CDR|Houston, can I do the P52 when I get into the darkness? Over.
094:40:37|T|CapCom|Stand by. Okay, we're preparing a REFSMMAT for you now, John, that you'll have to put in manually. Then you'll be able to proceed.
094:40:53|T|CDR|Roger. ...
094:40:58|T|LMP|Can't use that.
094:41:15|T|LMP|Here's the P27 pad.
094:41:21|T|CDR|Where's the G&amp;C Checklist?
094:41:50|T|CapCom|Okay, Orion. This is Houston. I have a - a P27 for you, one for REFSMMAT and the other's your state vector. Over.

094:42:18|T|CapCom|Orion, we - we'd like you to go back to Slew and place the antenna at the Stow position, minus 75 and minus 12 and just leave it there.
094:42:31|T|LMP|Tell them okay. We got it.
094:42:33|T|CDR|Okay, we got it.
094:42:34|T|CapCom|And, Charlie; if you're ready to copy, I have this P27 update for the REFSMMAT and state vector for you.

094:58:08|T|LMP|You skipped one. Did you skip one? Hey, why don't you do the RCS pressurization ...
094:58:16|T|CDR|Okay.
094:58:29|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We'd like you to close that circuit breaker and try an acquisition on the steerable.
094:58:40|T|LMP|Okay, it worked.
094:58:53|T|LMP|Okay, Jim; the yaw is still not working.
094:58:55|C|Irw|Understand. Yaw is still not working.
094:59:00|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
095:00:06|T|CDR|You doing it over ...? All right, good idea.
095:00:32|T|CDR|True.
095:00:42|T|CDR|Okay. Logic B has got a needle.
095:00:49|T|CDR|I'll get it.
095:01:11|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. We're pressurizing RCS now.
095:01:14|C|Irw|Roger. Understand you're pressurizing RCS.
095:02:20|T|CapCom|Okay, Orion. The RCS press looks good.
095:02:25|T|CDR|Stay ... P52, Jim.
095:02:38|C|Irw|Roger.
095:02:48|T|CDR|Okay, it's in.

095:03:41|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, we're ready for the RCS checkout. I guess we still don't have high bit rate, huh?
095:04:02|T|LMP|Houston. Over. Houston, this is Orion. Over.
095:04:10|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Open -

095:04:17|T|CDR|They are open.
095:04:20|T|LMP|No.
095:04:22|T|CDR|Say again?
095:04:23|T|LMP|Do you want us to open the ascent stage? No, don't do that!
095:04:28|C|Irw|Stand by, Charlie.
095:04:29|T|LMP|Excuse me.
095:04:32|T|CDR|That's all right, Charlie. What he said, wasn't it?
095:04:38|T|LMP|That ain't right. We're going to pump all the RCS into the APS tank, looks like to me.
095:04:51|T|CDR|Well, I just closed it again.
095:04:53|T|LMP|Good.
095:04:56|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. The RCS pressure is creeping up on system A.
095:05:09|T|LMP|Okay, it looks all right here, Hou - Houston.
095:05:14|T|CDR|Go ahead, Casper.
095:05:25|T|CDR|Roger. We're not going there yet. I'll tell you when.
095:05:31|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Do you read that System A manifold pressure?
095:05:38|T|CDR|Roger. System A manifold pressure is 195.
095:05:46|C|Irw|Copied 195.
095:05:49|T|CDR|190. Make it 190.
095:05:56|C|Irw|Roger; 190.
095:06:06|T|CDR|Dang, Charlie, you're a genius.
095:06:13|T|LMP|I practiced this.
095:06:14|T|CDR|Did you?
095:06:15|T|LMP|Yeah.
095:06:29|T|LMP|Okay, we got it.
095:06:30|T|CDR|Did you check the other one, too?
095:06:31|T|LMP|Yeah.
095:06:34|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. This is Houston. Looks like RCS manifold pressure on A is creeping up again. That's why we're holding you.
095:06:44|T|CDR|Okay, we - it does look like it's risen five pounds.
095:06:53|T|LMP|... do a P52?
095:06:56|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. Stay at Min Dead Band. We'll do a P52 here.

095:23:01|C|Irw|Orion. This is Houston with some words on your Hot Fire Check. You have a Go to do that Hot Fire Check on the back side. We'd like you to use System A. Of course, the procedure for that is to close Main SOV [Shut Off Valve] on System B and to open the Crossfeed so that you'll be using just System A. Over.
095:23:24|T|LMP|Say that again, Jim?
095:23:27|C|Irw|Roger. For your hot fire check on the back side, we want you to use system A. So we'd like you to close the Main SOV System B and open the Crossfeed. Over.

094:45:12|T|CMP|And, Hank, Jim's still up on our loop.
094:45:16|C|Har|Roger. He just went off, Ken.
094:45:21|T|CMP|Okay. Did you get my readback?
094:45:25|C|Har|That's affirmative. It was good.
094:45:34|T|CMP|And we ought to orbit down here at eight miles. This is really neat.
094:45:54|T|CMP|Did you have anything else for me, Hank?
094:45:56|C|Har|Roger; I had your P24 Pad for about 96:45. I think we've got time to get that in.
094:46:04|T|CMP|Yes, sir; let's go ahead. I'm ready.
094:46:07|C|Har|Okay. The target is 16-3. TI, 096:43:59, 096:45:37.0, 096:46:07, 096:46:29. Attitude, 015, 296, 000; north, 03 nautical miles.
094:46:55|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I thought 16-3 was to be used only for high altitude. That's kind of a large crater, isn't it?
094:47:06|C|Har|Stand by, and I'll check it.
094:47:08|T|CMP|Maybe that's the only one that's in the track. Okay, let me read it back to you, and just verify that later. 096:43:59, 96:45:37.0, 96:46:07, 96:46:29; roll, 015; pitch, 296; yaw, 000; north, 3 miles on 16-3.
094:47:32|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
094:47:35|T|CMP|Okay. And I'm going to go out the window here for just a minute. And I've got the VHF off so I can talk to you. If the LMs call me or something, you might give me a call.
094:47:47|C|Har|Okay, will do.
094:50:17|T|CMP|Okay, I'm coming up on the edge of the Kant Plateau now and, from down here, that looks like a real steep rise. That's very impressive. But there's nothing that's particularly significant about the topography or the texture, it just rises up.
094:50:31|C|Har|Roger; copy.
094:51:08|T|CMP|And all the surface here, Hank, has this striation effect to it. It's like we were looking at down there at - pictures of the Silver Spur and so forth. But this is on the horizontal surface. And it all has that same effect.
094:51:21|C|Har|Hey, that's really interesting.
094:52:29|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, we slipped by it. Coming up upside down and backwards almost vertical like this, I didn't get a very good hack at it, but I did get a - one look at it, and you can identify North and South Ray and all the features there, and got a look at that old Erastostenion [sic] Crater that's over to the southwest that shows beautiful lineaments in the photographs. And they aren't there visually from - from here. It looks like it has the same interior that all the rest of the things do. And I'll talk more about that later.
094:53:04|C|Har|Roger.
094:53:20|T|CMP|Okay, I'm ready to go to work.
094:53:26|T|CapCom|Did you get any photos in there?
094:53:30|T|CMP|Got just one. Just had one glance at it before it was occulted by the LM.
094:53:36|T|CapCom|Roger.
094:53:45|T|CapCom|Ken, did you get a Flight Plan change at a hundred hours and 20 minutes to charge Battery A?
094:54:07|T|CMP|No, sir.
094:54:08|T|CapCom|Okay, I couldn't tell from here whether that'd gone up or not. That - At a hundred hours, 20 minutes, we'd like to add "Charge Battery A.
094:54:19|T|CMP|Okay, charge Battery A at a hundred hours and 20 minutes, and I'm gonna go get my helmet and gloves on here. Then we'll do a little suit circuit integrity check. Got anything that we ought to do first?
094:54:38|T|CapCom|I'm just coming on. Did you happen to take a look at that docking latch? Okay, I've just been told that's all squared away. So I don't - don't know of anything that needs to be done now before you go ahead with the integrity check.
094:54:56|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to press into that.
095:02:16|T|CapCom|Casper, Houston. For your information, the LM's about four or five minutes from hot fire.
095:02:24|T|CMP|Okay, I'm still on a tight dead band.
095:02:28|T|CapCom|Okays I was just giving you a warning, in case you wanted to bring your VHF up or whatever you need to do to talk to them.
095:02:36|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
095:05:11|T|CMP|Orion, Casper.
095:05:14|T|CDR|Go ahead, Casper.
095:05:17|T|CMP|Okay, Orion. I understand you're coming up on the hot fire check, and I think I'm supposed to go to a Wide Dead Band. Can I have about two minutes to complete my suit check?
095:05:25|T|CDR|Roger. We're not going there yet. I'll tell you when.
095:05:28|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, sir.
095:05:33|T|CapCom|Casper, Houston. If you've got a sec there, I'd like to give you your sep Pad. Stand by; I'll wait until you get through with the check.
095:06:06|T|CMP|Houston, did you call Casper?
095:06:09|T|CapCom|Roger, Ken. I'll wait until you get through with your integrity check. Give me a call when you're through, please.
095:06:17|T|CMP|Okay, thank you. There's not much else I can do.
095:06:56|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. Stay at Min Dead Band. We'll do a P52 here.
095:07:03|T|CMP|Okay, I'm still in Min Dead Band. Thank you.
095:13:50|T|CMP|Okay, Casper's completed with a suit circuit integrity check.
095:13:55|T|CapCom|Real good, Ken. Can you copy a sep pad now?
095:14:12|T|CMP|Go ahead.
095:14:13|T|CapCom|Roger. Noun 33, 096:13:31.00. And your attitude is good except pitch is 105.
095:14:44|T|CMP|Okay, I copy. Noun 33, 096:13:31.00. The attitude: 000, 105, and 000.
095:14:56|T|CapCom|Good readback, Ken. And in regard to that question you had about 16-3, your present groundtrack is about 15,000 feet south of the preplanned, and that puts 16-1 outside the acceptable limits; 16-3 is closer to the landing site, and they would like for you to go ahead and use that.
095:15:20|T|CMP|Okay.
095:15:25|T|CapCom|And I guess the message is there, Ken, just shoot the center.
095:15:33|T|CMP|All right, I'll do that.
095:17:14|T|CMP|Okay, I don't have it Off yet, John. What happened to our hot fire?
095:17:20|T|LMP|We're still doing a P52. We'll get to you in a minute.
095:17:24|T|CMP|Okay, and you want B-3 Off now.
095:17:32|T|CMP|B-3 is Off.
095:24:18|T|CMP|Okay, say when you want the 620.
095:24:31|T|CMP|Okay, that's plus 2.68, plus 109.19, plus 5.03.
095:26:24|T|LMP|Okay, Ken, we need Wide Dead Band and Att Hold.
095:26:26|T|CapCom|Casper, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS.
095:26:34|T|CMP|Orion, say again, please.
095:26:37|T|CapCom|Roger. This is Houston, Casper. We're about two minutes from LOS.

095:27:11|T|CMP|Hi, gang.
095:27:11|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal toward the end of the Eleventh lunar revolution of Apollo 16. Still docked at this time, however, by the time that the two spacecraft come around the front side of the Moon again at the start of the 12th revolution they will have undocked. I have a schedule of Ground Elapsed Time of 96:13, about four minutes, correction six minutes prior to first acquisition on orbit number 12 as the spacecraft went around the corner. Duke and Young were conducting the Reaction Control System hot fire checks aboard Lunar Module Orion. There has been some difficulty in getting the steerable S-Band antenna on Orion to perform - particularly to yaw to the proper settings for providing good communications to Earth. However, for Revolution 13 which is the landing revolution we will have the 202 foot, 210 foot [64 metre] large communications dish at Goldstone, California in acquisition of the spacecraft and all the high bit rate data, voice and all of the forms of communication with Orion can be handled through the omni antennas, provided we do have the 210 foot antenna. There was some imbalance between Reaction Control System regulator pressures between Systems A and B; that was the reason why the crew was instructed to open the cross feed to allow some of the propellant from System A to go into the Ascent [Stage] propellant storage tanks. The propellant is not lost in this operation. It merely is transferred to another tank. Also the crew is instructed to use System A only for the RCS hot fire, also to take some of the load off of the RCS System A. We're some 45 minutes away from acquisition in revolution Number 12. At LOS, Apollo 16 at [sic] an orbit measuring 10.3 by 58.9 nautical miles [19.1 by 109.1 kilometres], and at 95:32 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

To summarize the apparent problem with the Lunar Module steerable antenna, if by the time of power descent and landing the problem has not sorted itself out and the antenna is, indeed, out of commission, right now, it appears that the crew cannot get the antenna to rotate in the yaw movement. It will be possible for all data in voice, high bit rate data, to be relayed to Earth through the Omni antennas starting with revolution number 13 which is the landing revolution. The 210 foot antenna in Goldstone, California will be the prime site. There's no apparent concern here in Mission Control with the potential loss of the steerable antenna. Some mention as been made of the fact that the meters that indicate antenna position sometimes fail or hang in the one indication, when actually, the antenna is properly rotating, but over the next two revolutions, this situation should sort itself out. At any rate, loss of the antenna does not mean that the landing will be aborted. We're still in a Go situation. And at next acquisition, the two spacecraft, Casper and Orion, will have been separated by some six minutes prior to acquisition. 28 minutes now until Acquisition Of Signal from Casper and Orion.

096:18:53|T|LMP|Okay, look up over my - our right side and look at that antenna, the - the steerable, and see how it - it's moving. I'm going to move it in pitch, then in yaw. Over.
096:19:05|T|CMP|Okay, on your right side. Okay: I got it, and it's moving in - It looks like a combination now. It's moving though. It's oscillating at this time.

096:55:43|T|CMP|Hank, it looks like we made a little discrepancy here in the way it is now. It shows we crossed out the Verb 48 at 97:15 to get us a 10101 because we were all ready there, I thought. And that doesn't look like the case. I guess we're gonna catch it up here after the burn. It is probably okay in its present form? Is that correct?
096:56:08|C|Har|That's affirmative. We went to 10102 back at 96:34, and we crossed out the one at 97:15, and we figured that same DAP, and it would hold you through the burn, and then we'll go to the new DAP after the burn.
096:56:29|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
096:56:30|C|Har|The reason is being - is because we do have 509 in there. We can't do another DAP with it running.
096:56:39|T|CMP|Roger. Understand that. Thank you, sir.
096:56:43|T|CMP|Just want to make sure with all the changes around in this 509 that we hadn't overlooked one.

096:25:26|T|LMP|Okay, we'll read you out - on the Noun 20 for the Command Module. Four balls 4, plus 10556, plus 00045; that time was at 96:02:20. Over.
096:26:26|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We hope you're at about the attitude. We'd like you to go to an acquisition here.
096:26:35|T|LMP|Okay, we're in attitude and we're going to give you the steerable.
096:27:23|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. How do you read me on the Forward omni? Over.
096:27:36|C|Irw|Charlie, I just barely read you on the Forward omni.
096:28:21|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Select Primary Transmitter Receiver.
096:29:27|C|Irw|Orion, Houston. How do you read?
096:29:33|T|CDR|Loud and clear.
096:29:35|C|Irw|Roger. We just barely hear you, and I have a landing site TCA for you if you're ready to copy.
096:29:43|T|CDR|Roger; can we now do the DPS pressurization checkout? Over.
096:29:54|C|Irw|Roger; we're ready for DPS press.
096:29:58|T|CDR|Okay.
096:29:59|T|LMP|Can you - Go ahead with the TCA now.
096:30:26|T|CDR|I checked all that, Charlie.
096:30:27|T|CDR|We're down to right here.
096:30:28|T|LMP|Okay, Master Arm, On.
096:30:30|T|CDR|Talkback l, Master ARMs On. Okay.
096:30:39|T|CDR|Two lights, Houston
096:30:41|T|LMP|Descent Propellant Isol Valve, Fire.
096:30:43|T|CDR|Okay, Descent Prop Isol Valve is going to Fire. ... to Pyro.
096:30:46|T|LMP|Helium Press Descent Start, Fire.
096:30:48|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Go to Downvoice Backup. Over.
096:30:55|T|LMP|We are in Downvoice Backup, Jim.
096:30:59|T|CDR|Okay, the DPS is pressurizing.
096:31:03|T|LMP|200 to 250, it should be.
096:31:07|T|CDR|Okay. It did pressurize, 245 to 245. And the Ambient Press is 410, the Supercrit Press is 1170.
096:31:38|T|CDR|Tell you one thing Charlie's not going to get up here, and that's scurvy.
096:31:39|C|Irw|Orion, Biomed switch, Off.
096:31:46|T|LMP|Biomed is Off, Jim.
096:31:56|C|Irw|Orion, the DPS pressurization checkout looks good.
096:32:02|T|CDR|Looked good to us.
096:32:20|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. Can you give us our TCA landing site?
096:32:36|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. The TCA landing site is 96:46:07. Over.
096:32:40|T|LMP|Roger; 96:46:07.
096:32:54|T|CDR|Okay, Charlie. I'm going to do the landing radar checkout now.
096:33:38|T|CDR|... landing radar checkout. Landing Radar breaker's In.
096:33:42|T|CDR|Transponders to Hi Multiple; Select, Landing Radar; H/H-dot; Landing Antenna to Auto.
096:33:52|T|LMP|There we go. Got them.
096:33:57|T|LMP|Go to Landing.
096:34:04|T|CDR|Radar Test to Landing; power signal light, out.
096:34:07|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, Houston on the steerable, I mean - listen at me - Orion on the steerable. How do you read? Over.
096:34:13|C|Irw|Orion, we read you much better.
096:34:18|T|LMP|Okay, it worked that time, Jim; we got a 4.2 signal strength, and the steerable is working, I'm in Track Mode, Auto.
096:34:25|C|Irw|Very good. I have some words for you on the RCS.
096:34:32|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
096:34:38|C|Irw|Okay, let's go normal configuration on your RCS and then we want you to transfer three percent more out of System A because we see the pressure going up on A.
096:34:51|T|LMP|Okay, transferring -
096:34:55|C|Irw|And the caution, of course - not more than 180 on the APS.
096:35:04|T|CDR|Okay, the landing radar H-dot is only reading minus 17 right now. The 8000 works okay.
096:35:26|C|Irw|Orion, will you give us Hi bit rate, please?
096:35:27|T|CDR|Okay, that looks good.
096:35:35|T|LMP|You got Hi bit rate; Biomed is Left.
096:35:38|C|Irw|Roger.
096:35:42|T|LMP|Jim, could we try a pitch maneuver back to the landing site viewing attitude, so we'll see if this thing tracks?
096:35:49|C|Irw|Stand by one.
096:35:53|C|Irw|Okay, just hold it one. We want to get our uplinks in and then you can try that maneuver.
096:36:01|T|LMP|Okay.
096:36:13|C|Irw|Okay, Orion; let's go P00 and Data and we'll send you an up-link.
096:36:27|T|LMP|Okay, you've got P00 and Data.
096:36:29|C|Irw|Roger.
096:36:33|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, the landing radar test is not working properly.
096:36:39|C|Irw|Okay, what's the problem, John?
096:36:44|T|CDR|Well, it's not reading the right numbers in altitude rate and it's not reading the right numbers in Verb 63. The Altitude Transmitter is 3.2, the Velocity Transmitter - Velocity Transmitter is 3.7.
096:37:07|C|Irw|Okay, Orion -
096:37:08|T|LMP|And, Jim, the AGS is loaded with the data card - go ahead.
096:37:13|C|Irw|Okay, we want you to select Normal Voice.
096:37:25|T|LMP|Okay, you have Normal Voice, AGS is loaded with the - with the data card numbers. Over.
096:37:29|C|Irw|Roger; I copied, Charlie.
096:37:46|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Are you also showing bad data on the tapemeter for the landing radar?
096:37:54|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
096:37:56|C|Irw|Roger.
096:37:57|T|CDR|The H - altitude is reading right at 8000, but the velocity was only reading 15. I'll run it again.
096:38:04|C|Irw|Roger
096:38:06|T|CDR|Can I run it while P27 is in progress?
096:38:10|C|Irw|Stand by on that one.
096:38:12|T|CDR|Yes, I'm sure I can.
096:38:24|C|Irw|Hold off on that landing radar check until after the - the up-link.
096:38:31|T|CDR|Okay. We'll go off and pull the circuit breakers.
096:39:00|T|LMP|Jim, we'd like to start a pitch - back down so we could see the landing site.
096:39:06|C|Irw|Stand by. We're still getting the up-link.
096:39:57|C|Irw|And, Orion; this is Houston. I have the Abort Pads whenever you're all ready.
096:40:06|T|LMP|Okay, stand by. Okay, go ahead.
096:40:14|C|Irw|.Okay, beginning.

096:41:19|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. That was a little bit too fast, but I think I got it all. 098:47:00.00, plus 0102.3, plus all balls, minus 0050.0; 0138.0, plus 0011.0, 0113.9; 0:35; all balls, 273; 5927.0; 012760 [sic] plus all balls, minus 0049.4; 099:35 all balls; 1,21:22:15.00. LM - that's throttle profile 10 percent for 26 seconds at full throttle; LM weight, 36673. Go ahead.
096:42:07|C|Irw|Roger. It's a good readback. Let me just confirm that Noun 86 Delta-V<sub>X</sub> is plus 0102.6, and we're finished with your computer. Okay, and we need an E-Mod dump for -
096:42:18|T|CDR|Okay, and I'm going into the landing radar check again.
096:42:19|C|Irw|- Verb 74. You have it.
096:42:25|T|CDR|You have it.
096:42:26|T|LMP|Okay, read that again, Jim. The - the Delta-V<sub>X</sub>.
096:42:31|C|Irw|Delta-V<sub>x</sub>, Noun 86, is plus 0102.6.
096:42:48|C|Irw|And, Charlie, I'm ready on the PDI PAD.
096:42:54|T|LMP|Okay, I was wrong on that. I got it now, 0102.6.
096:42:58|C|Irw|Okay, are you ready for PDI?
096:43:00|T|LMP|Go ahead with the PDI PAD.
096:43:02|C|Irw|Okay, India, zero -

096:43:45|T|CDR|Roger, Jim. Could we start a pitch attitude down to see the landing site? Are you done with our E-Mod, Jim?
096:43:56|C|Irw|We're finished with the E-Mod dump, but we'd just as soon get all these PADs up, and we're not concerned about the landing site - down here.
096:44:06|T|LMP|Okay -
096:44:07|T|CDR|I didn't think you were.
096:44:09|T|LMP|Okay, fine. I - I'm - I'm down through Kilo and I'll read back starting at India. 098:35:04.68; 11:04,plus 0002.6; 002, 114, 340 plus 56997, 101:22:15.00; 103:21:00.00. Over.
096:44:34|C|Irw|Okay, that's a good readback, and I have T2 and T3 for you. --
096:44:41|T|LMP|Go ahead.
096:44:44|C|Irw|Okay. T2, Lima, 098:59:29.03; 105:19:45.00; T2 at PDI, plus 24 plus 25; and T3, Nector, 100:42:42.86. Over.
096:45:09|C|Irw|Orion, will you verify Auto on the steerable?
096:45:15|T|LMP|It is in Auto.
096:45:17|C|Irw|Roger.
096:45:22|T|LMP|Okay, and reading back starting with Lima, 098:59:29.53; 105:19:45.00; November, 100:42:42.86. Go ahead with the next one. Over.
096:45:38|C|Irw|Okay, we're standing by for the - the landing radar checkout, John; and, of course, Charlie, you got that T2 at PDI at 24 plus 25, and I have an AGS K-factor for you.
096:45:53|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead with the AGS.
096:45:55|C|Irw|Okay. 00090, all zeros, 00111. Over.
096:46:18|T|LMP|Okay, copied 9 - 90, 00, 00111.
096:46:25|C|Irw|Good readback.
096:46:29|T|CDR|Okay - okay, there's the data. It's reading all right in H-dot, but it's changing data in - in the next two registers.
096:46:45|C|Irw|Roger; we're looking at it down here.
096:46:46|T|CDR|And the tapemeters is now - and the tapemeter is now reading 480 opening, and the altitude meter would - The first time I did it, it read 8000, and it's now reading zero.
096:47:07|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. Let's go Lo bit rate, and we're losing the steerable.
096:47:15|T|LMP|Jim, I don't think it's tracking in yaw.
096:47:44|C|Irw|Orion, we'll get back to you on the landing radar.
096:47:50|T|LMP|Roger.
096:47:56|C|Irw|And, Orion -
096:47:57|T|LMP|You can see the data.
096:47:58|C|Irw|- Houston, just a reminder on - to load 405 and 406 to plus zero.
096:48:06|T|LMP|Roger.
096:48:08|C|Irw|And we're ready for Hi bit rate.
096:48:08|||<p class="tech"><b>096 48 [8 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, you have it.
096:48:19|C|Irw|Roger.
096:48:24|T|CDR|Okay, I'm going to terminate the landing radar test, if that's okay with y'all.
096:48:27|C|Irw|Roger.
096:48:50|T|CDR|That's negative; Houston wants them to stay locked on right now.
096:49:55|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. I have the Circ Pad if you're ready to copy.
096:50:00|T|LMP|Stand by.
096:50:09|T|LMP|Go ahead.
096:50:10|C|Irw|Okay, ignition at 097:40:17.16; Noun 81, plus 0068.1, minus all zeros, minus 0058.0. Over.

096:50:39|C|Irw|Good readback.
096:50:47|T|CDR|Okay, we'll go ahead and go the - do the IMU fine align right now, if that's okay with you, Houston.
096:50:55|C|Irw|Roger; we're standing by, John.
096:51:15|C|Irw|Okay, Charlie, will you - In 404, will you put minus 12345?
096:51:27|T|LMP|Roger.
096:51:29|T|CDR|Okay, Houston, when we do this attitude maneuver for the P52, we're going to lose high gain.
096:51:37|C|Irw|Stand by.
096:51:38|T|CDR|is that all right?
096:51:39|C|Irw|I think we're all prepared for it.
096:51:42|T|CDR|Okay.
096:52:03|C|Irw|Okay, you can go ahead and maneuver, John -
096:52:04|T|CDR|Okay, that's ...
096:52:05|C|Irw|- and we want you to use the RCS system A.
096:52:07|T|CDR|Okay. Okay, we're using System A.
096:52:47|T|LMP|Okay, Houston, we have you on the aft omni.
096:53:29|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Go Lo bit rate.
096:53:37|T|CDR|You have it.
096:58:12|T|LMP|Okay, Houston. The torquing angles: minus 0.000, plus 1.39, minus 0.018.
096:58:27|C|Irw|Orion, we cannot read you. Will you go Downvoice Backup?
096:58:58|C|Irw|Orion, go Aft Omni.
096:59:03|T|CDR|Okay, Aft Omni.
096:59:17|C|Irw|Okay, may - perhaps we can read the torquing angles, if you want to give them again.
096:59:39|T|CDR|Star - angle difference was minus four balls five.
097:00:20|C|Irw|Okay, we copied your Noun 05, but we did not get the torquing angles. I hope y'all have written them down.
097:01:13|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We'd like to get Hi Bit Rate again and some good voice. We'd like you to go back to that attitude which we gave you of pitch of 053 and set in the steerable angles of Pitch plus 26 and Yaw minus 12.
097:01:30|T|LMP|Okay, we're en route.
097:01:32|C|Irw|And just delay the landing radar test until we get some good data.
097:01:38|T|CDR|Okay.
097:01:54|T|LMP|I guess on that landing radar - with the circuit breaker in - probably working off the ground - maybe not.
097:02:14|C|Irw|Go Forward Omni, Orion.
097:03:09|C|Irw|Okay, Orion, let's go back to Lo bit rate until we get the steerable.
097:03:50|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, we have you now on the steerable. How do you read? Over.
097:03:56|C|Irw|Oh, I read you loud and clear. You sound beautiful.
097:04:01|T|LMP|Okay, the P52 went super. Our torquing angles were minus 0.060, plus 0.139, minus 0.018. We torqued at 96:58:40. Over.
097:04:15|C|Irw|Roger; copied. On torquing angles, minus 060, plus 0.139, and minus 0 - 0.018 at 96:58:40.
097:04:28|T|LMP|That's Roger.
097:04:33|C|Irw|And you can go Normal voice.
097:04:34|T|LMP|And the AGS checkout has gone well.
097:04:36|T|CDR|Okay.
097:04:42|T|LMP|The only thing we haven't done is rendezvous radar checkout and we'll get to that soon as Ken gets through with his burn.
097:04:48|C|Irw|Roger; we're recommending that rendezvous radar checkout on the back side, mid landing radar checkout is the one we want to go through now.
097:04:56|T|LMP|All right, fine.
097:05:02|T|CDR|Okay, we're going now.
097:05:39|C|Irw|Okay, John, when you get to the Noun 66 -
097:05:41|T|LMP|Do you reckon it could - .
097:05:42|C|Irw|- 67 values, we want you to read us the tapemeter values of H and H-dot.
097:05:52|T|CDR|Okay, it's right on, Houston. It's 8000 at 480 off the H-dot.
097:06:01|C|Irw|Roger; we copy.
097:06:13|T|CDR|Okay, minus 495, plus 1860, plus 1331.
097:06:21|T|CDR|Right on. And the tape reader is up and left and it's reading 8000 at 480. I think it was locked on the ground or something when we came over that low pass, due to our communications angle. That may be wrong, but that - you know - it was sure acting funny.
097:06:13|T|CDR|Okay, minus 495, plus 1860, plus 1331, right on, and the tapemeter is up and left and it's reading 8000 at 480. I think it was locked on the ground or something when we came over that low pass, due to our communications angle. That may be wrong, but that's - you know - it was sure acting funny.
097:06:34|C|Irw|Okay, it's looking good to us now.
097:06:39|T|CDR|Okay, we've got 3.2 on the Altitude Transmitter and 345 on the Velocity Transmitter; make that 355.
097:06:48|C|Irw|Okay, we copy.
097:06:53|T|LMP|Hey, Jim, on those drink bags, I tell you, it's pretty hard to see things when you've got a helmet full of orange juice in zero gravity, it's something with that orange juice.
097:07:03|C|Irw|Well, you've got to drink fast.
097:07:08|T|LMP|You really do.
097:07:20|T|CDR|When do we get the 210 up, Jim?
097:07:28|C|Irw|Okay, acquisition on your next rev.
097:08:30|T|LMP|Hey, Jim, we had to turn on our window heaters for about ten minutes per side to clear up the windows - right aft - right before undocking.
097:08:38|C|Irw|Roger; we copy.
097:08:47|T|LMP|We've been using the - we've been using the LCG pump to keep cool in here, and it's really neat.
097:08:53|C|Irw|We copy.
097:08:59|T|CDR|We've been needing something to keep cool, I'll tell you.
097:09:02|C|Irw|Yeah, we understand completely.
097:09:16|T|LMP|Jim, your up-link voice is just beautiful in every antenna we got. Over.
097:09:26|C|Irw|Okay, that's a good data point. Unfortunately, the down-link is very, very noisy.
097:09:36|T|LMP|Okay, I wonder what happened. On the check - the comm checks we did at 55 hours, of course, it was closer, but it was real good then, I thought.
097:09:57|C|Irw|Okay, we understand it's just a completely different situation, Charlie.
097:10:06|T|LMP|Okay.
097:10:09|C|Irw|But your voice is just crystal clear right now.
097:10:17|T|CDR|Roger.
097:12:46|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston with some trajectory information for you.
097:12:56|T|LMP|Go ahead.
097:12:57|C|Irw|Roger. It looks like you'll be coming in about 10,000 feet [3000 metres] high at PDI, John, which will be about 3 to 4 seconds of hover time, and you'll be 17,000 feet [5000 metres] -
097:13:09|T|CDR|Understand.
097:13:10|C|Irw|- south.
097:13:14|T|LMP|Okay, does that mean that we're going to be - at pitchover, we'll be steering from south to north?
097:13:21|C|Irw|That's affirmative.
097:13:21|||<p class="tech"><b>097 !3 25 Young (LM):</b> Okay, so at pitchover, we'll be - you'll be targeting us right into the target, but we'll be steering from south to north. Is that based on Ken's tracking?
097:13:38|C|Irw|No, that's not - Negative on that one.
097:13:42|C|Irw|But you'll probably be coming straight in by the time you get down to pitchover.
097:13:48|T|CDR|Okay, thank you.
097:13:51|T|CDR|How did landmark tracking turn out ?
097:13:57|C|Irw|Stand by.
097:14:05|C|Irw|Okay, the landmark tracking looked very good, John.
097:14:10|T|CDR|Okay.
097:14:18|C|Irw|Orion, will you give us your ED Bat read-out, please?
097:14:27|T|LMP|The same as always, 37 volts.
097:14:30|C|Irw|Very good.
097:14:43|T|CDR|Jim, is Guidance going to have any gyro drift for us ?
097:14:47|C|Irw|Stand by.
097:14:57|C|Irw|Okay, no update on that. And it looks like your - the attitude for PDI is very close to the one that we'd like for the s - steerable, so we'll try that when you come around at AOS.
097:15:14|T|CDR|Okay.
097:15:16|T|LMP|And, Jim, on this P52. That radar has drifted up into the field of view, but it's no sweat just moving it down in slew. It's smooth.
097:15:28|C|Irw|Okay, we copy.
097:15:39|T|LMP|And one other thing that - when we put those state vectors in there, I guess we didn't have any - the LM vector in there and my Computer Activity light stayed on all the time. I finally figured out what it was and did a Verb 66 and got rid of it.
097:15:55|C|Irw|Okay, we concur.
097:15:57|T|LMP|I think - I think that's what it was.
097:16:01|C|Irw|Everybody's nodding their head down here - affirmative.
097:17:06|T|LMP|Houston, 16 - what appears to be the problem with System A. Is it a reg[ulator] problem or what?
097:17:08|C|Irw|Yes, that's affirmative, Charlie, a reg problem.
097:17:14|T|LMP|Okay, will we have a - If we use up fuel - just System A for descent, is what you want us to do.
097:17:23|C|Irw|Stand by. We'll give you an RCS configuration for PDI when y'all come around the corner.
097:17:31|T|LMP|Okay. Well, we'll be back.
097:17:40|T|CDR|And I'd like somebody to think about this high APS pressure we have during the lunar stay. Over.
097:17:50|C|Irw|Okay, we're looking at that one too, John.
097:18:11|C|Irw|Okay, we are noticing an increase in the RCS pressure there, but we have enough ullage volume now to get the - all the propellant out.
097:18:26|T|CDR|Understand. Thank you.
097:19:08|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Have you -
097:19:09|T|CDR|Yes, If we were on hot mike -
097:19:10|C|Irw|- ever noticed any change in your yaw meter?
097:19:17|T|CDR|Jim, it's - stuck on minus 12.
097:19:21|C|Irw|Okay, and go ahead, John.
097:19:26|T|CDR|I think that if we're on hot mike when we're talking to each other, I want to apologize right now. It's probably pretty interesting. Probably not, if the comm was as bad as you said it was.
097:19:45|C|Irw|It was good enough for us to understand you.
097:19:52|T|CDR|We were afraid of that.
097:20:06|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. If you see that reg pressure creeping up, you could do a small maneuver, which would help the situation.
097:20:15|T|LMP|Understand; we'll do that.
097:20:21|T|CDR|We'll do a Verb 49 for the AGS cal attitude, Jim.
097:20:33|C|Irw|Okay. And, Orion, we're coming up on about two minutes to LOS.
097:20:45|T|CDR|Roger; two minutes to LOS. See you around for PDI.
097:21:15|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. For your information the burst disk pressure is 215 to 220 - the RCS.
097:21:26|T|LMP|Roger; understand. Jim, is it both systems you see climbing?
097:21:35|C|Irw|Just System A.
097:21:39|T|LMP|Just System A, right.
097:22:21|T|LMP|Hey, Jim, I saw the landing site as we passed over it. We're not going to have any trouble recognizing it from the rays. The rays stand out beautifully.
097:22:28|C|Irw|Very good. Glad to hear it.
097:22:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control and both spacecraft have passed behind the Moon during the end of the 12th lunar orbit. During this pass - rather interesting frontside pass, several nagging problems have cropped up or have been carried over from the preceding revolution. One concern is the Landing Radar which in its self-test mode gave some spurious readouts, the readouts never agreeing with what the test should be. Later on in a repetition of the Landing Radar self-test, the numbers on the onboard display came out as they should. John Young speculated that perhaps because of the low altitude at the time of the first attempt at the Landing Radar self-test, they were getting some ground reflections from the lunar surface which caused the self-test to be invalid. The self-test of the Rendezvous Radar has been postponed until the upcoming backside pass prior to acquisition on Rev 13. The steerable antenna situation is still coming in and out as the steerable antenna appears to be locked in a stowed position. However, with the spacecraft attitude, oriented such that the antenna faces the Earth, we've had fairly good communications during the better part of this front side pass. The 210-foot dish at Goldstone will acquire the spacecraft at the start of Rev 13, and even if the steerable antenna is completely inoperative, all high bit rate data communications, voice, everything normally carried by the steerable antenna through the 85-foot dishes will be available on the ground. [On] the Lunar Module Reaction Control System regulator situation, the crew is still running through some procedures to manage the two systems, A and B, of the Reaction Control System aboard the Lunar Module to balance the regulator pressures for the propellants. System A appears to creep upward slightly, periodically, and by opening the cross-feed valve, venting some of the propellant into the ascent tanks, it appears that the situation will stabilize. The Descent Propulsion System throttle check and the Descent Propulsion System pressurization routines were carried out completely normally earlier in Revolution 12. Ken Mattingly, meanwhile, was given a Go to circularize with the Command Module, Casper. Ignition time for this burn is 97 hours, 40 minutes, 17 seconds. It will be a Service Propulsion System burn, [of] 99.6 feet per second. We'll circularize at about 51.8 by 68.2 [nautical miles]. This is slightly elliptical but because of the perturbations of lunar orbit, the orbit of the Command Module should be almost circular at the time of rendezvous. Acquisition: 43 minutes, 23 seconds from now, as both spacecraft coming around the front side. None of the problems mentioned with the RC Reaction Control System regulators or the steerable antenna preclude the lunar landing.

098:11:13|C|Har|Casper, Houston. How do you read?
098:11:16|T|CMP|Okay; they're locking up on me. Hello, Houston. This is Casper Bar [?] now. We did not do [the] Circ [burn], and I'd like to talk about the TVC servo loops.
098:11:29|C|Har|Understand. No Circ.
098:11:33|T|CMP|That's affirmative. Presently, about a mile ahead of the LM. And I'd like to talk about a TVC servo loop problem.
098:11:51|C|Har|Okay, Ken. Go ahead.
098:11:55|T|CMP|Okay, and - and break in and tell me as soon as you get the DS - get ready to dump the DSE, so you can take a look at what I'm talking about, and I'll leave the antenna Manual and Wide until you do. Okay; the text is that we came up to the burn time and I was going through the gimbal checks. Number 1 servo started normally, checked out. I switched to - clockwise on the THC to perform the secondary gimbal check and started them - they looked normal. I set the pitch trim normally, and I went to set the yaw trim; I'd just been checking that the trim lock [?] worked, and I got divergent oscillations on the yaw trim indicator, and you could feel them in the spacecraft. So I switched to the - Servo Power to the Number 2 Servo to AC1/Main A, tried that. That had no effect. Then I cycled through looking at - at the gimbal - with the Auto Drive switch in Number 1, Number 2 in Auto. Every time I selected Number 2, by some means, I had the same results. Then I tried SCS in Auto, and as soon as I would excite some motion in the secondary yaw servo, why it would go unstable again. I then tried using the G&amp;N to drive the gimbal, and I did the first half of the gimbal drive in Servo Loop 1, then switched to the Servo Loop 2 for the second half, and again the same instability showed up. Based on the [mission] rule of four servo loops, I canceled Circ. I had no other indications in the cockpit, no warning lights, no - no other abnormalities.
098:13:58|C|Har|Roger. We copy -
098:14:01|T|CMP|The ... was in fact running, but I don't think that could have had any effect when SCS was going.
098:14:10|C|Har|Roger. Could we get you to go to the AOS attitude, Ken, so we can dump the data?
098:14:20|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Will do.
098:14:25|T|CMP|How about if I just give you the high gain from right here?
098:14:31|C|Har|Okay, if you think you can get it up.
098:15:30|T|CMP|Okay; I've got you a solid lock on the high gain.
098:15:40|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We'd like to verify that -
098:15:41|T|CMP|... So I can keep the LM in sight.
098:15:54|C|Har|Casper, we'd like to verify that the - that the oscillations were on servo loop Number 2. Is that correct?
098:16:00|T|CMP|That's affirmative. Servo loop Number 2, yaw only.
098:16:08|C|Har|Roger. And servo loop Number 1 is okay?
098:16:11|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
098:16:18|C|Har|And did I read that the first time through the servo checks, they were okay? And then when you started to set the yaw trim, the oscillation started, and that once you had the malfunction, it occurred in -
098:16:31|T|CMP|No, sir. No, sir. Primary loop checked out normally. Secondary loop never checked out in yaw servo.
098:16:40|C|Har|Roger; copy. And that was both -
098:16:43|T|CMP|... started normally, and it's - Go ahead, Hank.
098:16:49|C|Har|Roger. And that occurred both in SCS and G&amp;N, is that correct?
098:16:56|T|CMP|That's affirmative. And I tried both Auto and Rate Command in SCS.
098:17:21|C|Har|And, Ken, We'd like to confirm that was a divergent oscillation. Is that correct?
098:17:28|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
098:19:08|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We'd like for you to run another gimbal drive check in the yaw axis on both SCS and G&amp;N, and let us take a look at it.
098:19:18|T|CMP|Okay; I'm prepared to do that right now if you're ready.
098:19:24|C|Har|Ready to go.
098:20:13|T|CMP|Okay; I'm bringing the Bus Ties on.
098:20:30|T|CMP|Okay, and ServoPowers 1 and 2 are on in the loop configuration. Are you ready for me to start the gimbals ?
098:20:41|C|Har|That's affirmative, Ken. Go ahead.
098:20:51|T|CMP|Okay, here comes - You just wanted to look at the yaw. Here comes Yaw number 2. There it is, and it's oscillating now, and it's damped out, and that's in Auto. I'll switch it to Number 2, and Number 2 in Auto. I'm now going to move the , and it - Well, now it's - there it goes - now it's oscillating, and it's divergent, and I'm turning the Gimbals Off. Okay, Yaw Gimbal Number 2 is Off. I'll hold this configuration.
098:32:45|T|CDR|Ken, is your transponder on?
098:32:50|T|CMP|That's affirmative. It is.
098:32:59|T|LMP|Okay. We're gonna try our radar lockup here again.
098:33:07|T|CMP|Okay.
098:34:03|T|CMP|John, you want to try to initialize VHF ranging while we're above it?
098:34:35|T|CMP|Orion, Casper.
098:34:45|T|CMP|Would you like to try and check out our VHF at the same time?
098:34:49|T|LMP|Okay.
098:35:02|T|CMP|Sounds very garbled. If you can read me, Orion, you're extremely garbled and making a pulsing-noise sound.
098:35:51|T|CMP|Orion, do you read me on B Duplex?
098:37:10|T|CMP|Orion, do you read Casper? Orion, do you read Casper?
098:37:31|T|CMP|Houston, Casper.
098:37:33|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Go ahead.
098:37:39|T|CMP|Roger. It looks like I'm losing comm with Orion. Could you ask them to go back to A Simplex?
098:37:45|C|Har|Wilco.
098:38:00|T|LMP|Go ahead, Ken.
098:38:03|T|CMP|Okay, you were just about unreadable. I don't know if you could pick me up on that other configuration, but that didn't work at all. Yeah, but it was coming through completely garbled - unintelligible. Okay. Okay; and if no voice in 30 seconds, we'll come back to A Simplex. Okay, how do you read me now? You're still very scratchy, hardly make you out at all. Yeah, that's pretty bad. That's not much better; it's not near like what we got before. Let's go back to A Simplex.
098:39:16|T|CMP|Hey, you sound good now.
098:40:00|T|CMP|Hey, Charlie.
098:40:18|T|CMP|Okay, you want to turn your light on when it gets dark? And how about let's try a little ranging here, before we go into the darkness?
098:40:25|T|MCC|... CapCom -
098:40:26|T|CMP|- comm now - you're on - on configuration for ranging.
098:40:30|T|MCC|Hey - am I - Hey, Gerry, am I on your loop? Okay. Hey, on - on this conversation here, I ran this rendezvous from the miniball.
098:40:45|T|CMP|Hey, Stuart, you're on air-to-ground.
098:40:48|T|MCC|Sorry about that, Ken.
098:40:51|T|CMP|Hey, Charlie, let's - hey, Charlie, how about let's try out this ranging? You're in the ranging configuration, right? Okay, stand by for about 30 seconds until I try to lock up.
098:41:34|T|CMP|Okay, I've got you at 0.36; 0.38; 0.36, bouncing around. How does that compare? It doesn't really.
098:25:24|T|CMP|Gee, I think so. Might as well keep an eye on it, looks like we're getting ready to go in the dark here. Could you wait until we get in the dark so I can look at you? Right now, I've got the Sun right smack in my eyes.
098:45:40|T|CMP|Did you get any words out of Houston? I haven't heard a word from them.
098:45:50|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're working on a problem down here.
098:45:57|T|CMP|Roger, Henry. I understand that; but I'm not bugging you. We'll stay off the loop.
098:46:02|C|Har|Okay, we've got the data down, and we've got the strip charts, and we' re taking a look here and see if we can't find some way to get around it.
098:46:11|T|CMP|Okay. I know if there's a way, you'll find it.

098:50:48|T|CMP|Go ahead, Houston.
098:50:50|C|Har|Okay. We're getting set up for another gimbal drive check, Ken, and what we want to do is go through a complete gimbal drive check by the numbers, and have you tell us as you do each thing and especially in relation to the - the yaw thumb-wheel, which way you're moving it and how many degrees and - and what's happening. And we'll give you the word when we're ready to start that. We've got to get some things configured down here.
098:51:16|T|CMP|Okay. Was attitude - How about looking ahead to see if this attitude is going to hold throughout the test?
098:51:23|C|Har|Okay, I'll check it.
098:51:27|T|CMP|Thank you.
098:51:33|C|Har|The attitude is good, Ken.

098:54:10|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We're ready to go. Do you think VOX might make it easier for you?
098:54:20|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I'll go to VOX now and, Orion, are you still working on your [P]52?
098:54:31|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to have my head in the cockpit here for a while, but if Mr. Kepler isn't a high school dropout, why, we won't hit anyhow.
098:54:46|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Here we go. I'm gonna run over the switch configuration that I've got in the cockpit. We're going to do this - everything except calling P40, or do you want to call P40 for something?
098:55:01|C|Har|We don't need P40.
098:55:03|T|CMP|... you do not want P40. Okay, here we go. I got - The circuit breakers are all checked over on Panel 8. The only ones that are out are RCS Logic, the Probe, and the stuff on the bottom rows that don't matter. Okay. The switches for SCS are in Limit Cycle, Off; Dead Band, Min; Rate, Low. I've got the Rotation Power at AC. Direct are Off. I've got my BMAGs. I'm going to ungag them now. They're ungagged. I'm going to SCS Control. Okay. Now I'm going over and catch the - the bus ties. Here comes Bus Tie, AC. It's On. EC is On. Gimbal power Number 1 to AC 1, number 2 to AC 2. Start Pitch Gimbal Number 1.
098:56:14|T|CMP|Mark. And Yaw Gimbal number 1.
098:56:19|T|CMP|Mark. I have a thumb-wheel drive. I'm driving it from zero to minus one-half to plus one-half, which is the trim. The Yaw thumb-wheel is at plus one half. I'm going to take it to zero and back up to 1, and will set it at 122. It runs smoothly in both directions. I'm making an MTVC check in Pitch. There's a little plus Pitch, a little minus Pitch - that's good - a little minus Yaw, a little plus Yaw. That's good and stable. I'm going to CMC Control.
098:56:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Aboard the Command Module, Ken Mattingly is troubleshooting the SCS reading out what his onboard indications are.

098:56:55|T|CMP|Mark. I have no MTVC. I'm going clockwise on the translation hand controller.
098:57:01|T|CMP|Mark it. I still have no MTVC. I'm bringing on the Pitch 2 Gimbal -
098:57:08|T|CMP|Mark. I'm checking the thumb-wheel down to zero, up to 1, back to one-half. The Yaw thumb-wheel is going over to ... and I don't - Let me try it again. There it goes. Had the Motor on; now I'm turning it Off. I'll turn it on one more time. ... it's stable. I'm taking the trim, which is now set at a little over 1 on the thumb-wheel, down towards zero. I move it slowly. It gets a little dynamics, and then it stops. I'm going to take it down to zero at about this rate. It oscillates, and now it's diverging, and I'm turning the Gimbal Motor Off. I'm going to hold in this configuration.
098:57:54|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
098:59:13|C|Har|Ken, what we would like for you to do now is crank up the Yaw 2 Gimbal again to that stable condition, and then let's see what MTVC does to it - see if that will excite the oscillation.
098:59:28|T|CMP|It did last time. I now have the Gimbal on again, and I'm going to give it a little Yaw, and there it goes. Coming Off -
098:59:36|T|CMP|Mark.

098:59:49|T|CMP|Would you like to take a look at it in Accel Command?
098:59:53|C|Har|Stand by.
098:59:59|T|CMP|Understand. Stand by.
099:00:04|C|Har|Roger. Ken, go ahead and let's try it in Accel Command.
099:00:15|T|CMP|Okay, and it's diverging all on its own in Accel Command. I didn't put any inputs into it.

099:02:38|C|Har|Hello, Orion and Casper. This is Houston.
099:02:47|C|Har|Roger. It looks like we're not going to have a decision on this rev, and we do have the capability of spending about five revs in this configuration before we have to make that decision. We would like y'all to move into a station-keeping position, and you should be at the closest point of approach at about 100 hours, and we're recommending a CSM active to move into a position and to station-keep. And we're gonna run some simulations down here on this TVC problem, and we'll get back to you.
099:03:32|C|Har|Casper, this is Houston. You copied, too, didn't you?
099:03:37|C|Har|Okay.
099:03:38|T|CMP|Roger. I'm with you. I still have the - some of the gimbal motors on and the bus ties. Want to stand by on that?
099:03:43|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We'd like to try one more thing. There's a remote possibility that the RHC may be inducing some noise or transients into the system. We'd like you to kill all power to the RHC. Cut off both AC and DC, and repeat the gimbal check in AC Accel Command and see if the gimbal takes off.
099:04:09|T|CMP|Okay. I've got - I secured the hand controller by just taking Normal 2 Power to Off, and the rest of the Powers were Off. I'm in Accel Command on Yaws and I'm going Number 2 up to Start, and it's in Accel, and it's stable. Would you like for me to try the thumbwheels?
099:04:34|C|Har|Stand by one.
099:04:35|T|CMP|And with a little excitation from the thumb-wheel, it took off again.
099:04:39|C|Har|Roger. Understand.
099:05:09|C|Har|Ken, for that rendezvous, we're suggesting you use the procedure you worked on there in the simulator, just move it in, and when you're that close, you approach.
099:05:19|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Will do that. Thank you.
099:05:23|C|Har|Let me see if there's anything else they want to do with this gimbal thing before we shut it down? Stand by one.
099:07:30|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We'd like for you to try, for our data, one more Yaw primary - Yaw secondary G&amp;N servo loop check - gimbal check.
099:08:09|T|CMP|Henry, did you say primary and secondary on this G&amp;N drive?
099:08:14|C|Har|Negative. Just - just the secondary loop. I didn't mean to say primary.
099:08:21|T|CMP|Okay. Can I turn the other three gimbal motors off?
099:08:27|C|Har|Say again. You were blocked out.
099:08:32|T|CMP|I say, I'd like to turn the other three gimbal motors off if we don't need them.
099:08:37|C|Har|Roger. Go ahead and turn those off.
099:08:50|T|CMP|Okay. I'm now in - I'm in S - in CMC Control. I'm setting up 204, and I have program 509 loaded. I'm starting Gimbal number 2 Yaw. Okay. It's stable now. I'm going to do a Proceed on 204.
099:09:16|C|Har|Roger.
099:09:49|T|CMP|Well, doesn't look like I got anything that time.
099:09:52|C|Har|I suspect you've got to be in G&amp;N or CMC Control, haven't you?
099:10:01|T|CMP|Okay. Let's try it again. Go back over everything.
099:10:30|T|CMP|Okay. I'm coming up. I'm going to start it again. I'm going to try it. Now, as soon as I turn - Well, by golly, it - it damped itself there, it started out wild, and it's settled down. Now I'm going to Proceed on 204.
099:10:45|C|Har|Roger.
099:09:53|T|CMP|Plus two, and it's oscillating. Minus two, and it's oscillating about one degree each, and it's oscillating in the center, it is not divergent, however. Well - now it's gone to trim, and it's oscillating about plus or minus - almost two degrees - or plus or minus one degree. I'm going to turn it Off -

099:10:35|C|Irw|Orion, we're happy with your present RCS configuration.
099:12:22|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. And if - you're in P00; if you'll go to Data, we'll send you a state vector. Over.
099:12:34|T|CDR|Roger. You have it. Go ahead.
099:12:35|C|Irw|Roger.
099:15:01|C|Irw|And, Orion, we're 2 minutes from LOS.
099:15:17|T|LMP|Copy, Jim. And we're going to - Updata Link to Off.
099:15:43|C|Irw|Orion, we're finished with your computer.
099:15:49|T|LMP|Roger. Thank you much.

099:15:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, 99 hours, 31 minutes Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16. To recap the current situation here in Mission Control Center, various considerations are underway on whether or not to continue the mission with a later landing or to have the two spacecraft, Orion and Casper, rendezvous, dock and do a Trans-Earth Injection burn using the Lunar Module's Descent Propulsion System. This would assume of course that the Service Propulsion System on the Command Module is inoperative, because of the apparent problem in the SCS or Stabilization Control System, which in turn drives and controls the SPS system, aboard the Command Service Module. We have something in the neighborhood of five revolutions or about 10 hours in which to reach the decision on the outcome of the lunar landing. As Orion came around the East limb of the Moon this last revolution in preparation for Power Descent Initiation, they were prepared for the landing. However Casper, piloted by Ken Mattingly, reported that he had not made the Circularization Burn. Since that time there have been many huddles here in the Control Room; engineers are going over drawings in the back rooms, simulations are underway here at the Manned Spacecraft Center to determine the nature of the Service Propulsion System control problem and hopefully by the time the crew comes around the corner again some 31 minutes from now at least some clarity will come out of the situation. But as mentioned earlier it may take the entire five revolutions. The limit of five revolutions has to do with the orbital geometry because after that time the orbital plain of the Lunar Module would be - would have drifted so far away from the landing site that the - there's not ample propellant to steer into the Descartes landing area from the present orbit without a [orbital] plane change.

To recap again the current situation in the mission, the circularization burn for command module Casper was aborted when Ken Mattingly discovered some discrepancies in the backup system which control the Service Propulsion Engine. We still have a good prime system, that is a Guidance and Navigation system aboard the Command Module, however, we would be one failure away for the very critical Trans-Earth Injection maneuver which requires a fairly lengthy burn and a stable engine bell from the Service Propulsion System; therefore, quite a few people here in Houston and at the spacecraft manufacturer in Downey, California are looking into the ramifications of the backup system having apparently failed would this present any structural strain on the spacecraft if the engine bell went to full yaw, and would we be able to do a successful Trans Earth Injection with this engine. As all of these questions are answered the decision will be made whether or not to continue with the landing phase or to rendezvous and do a Trans Earth Injection burn using the Descent Engine on the Lunar Module, Orion. We have about five revolutions or some 10 hours in total time in which to make this decision. This, again, is dictated by the orbital mechanics. The fact that the Lunar Module would drift away from the desired ground track for the landing site at Descartes during any time past these five revolutions. The Gold Team of flight controllers will stay on duty in the Control Center for the landing if a decision is made to land. If the decision is made to rendezvous and do a docked descent propulsion burn to bring the spacecraft home, Pete Frank's Orange Team will take over.

100:05:19|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. How do you read?
100:05:24|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Read you loud and clear.
100:05:26|T|LMP|Roger; same-o, Jim. We're about 0.7 of a mile 1.3 kilometres] out from Casper now.
100:05:42|C|Irw|Say again, Charlie. We still have excessive noise down here.
100:05:46|T|LMP|I say our range to Casper is about 0.7 of a mile.
100:05:51|T|CDR|And he's opening at 2½ [feet per second, 0.8 metres per second]. He put in some posigrade velocity to go up and above and come down and get with us.
100:06:08|T|CMP|John, I think that total is still slightly retrograde.
100:06:12|T|CDR|The total is slightly retrograde?
100:06:18|T|CMP|Yeah, you - I - I'm thinking maybe I ought to go put some more in there. What do you think?
100:06:31|T|CMP|Okay.
100:06:50|C|Irw|Okay, 16. This is Houston. We still don't have an answer, but people are working very feverishly.
100:07:18|C|Irw|Roger.
100:07:25|T|CMP|That only shows 9.2 [2.8 metres per second]. Why don't we get them to get an arc on this? I guess I'd like to know how good my vector was to start with.
100:07:38|T|CMP|Say again? I'm sorry; I can't hear you.
100:07:49|T|CMP|I know, but my state vector is good. How good is it?
100:07:55|C|Irw|Stand by, Ken.
100:08:04|T|CMP|Roger. I'm trying now.
100:08:25|C|Irw|Go ahead, Orion.
100:08:56|T|CMP|Houston, do you read Casper?
100:09:00|C|Irw|Roger. That looks that way to us, Charlie.
100:09:02|T|CMP|Houston, do you read Casper?
100:09:07|C|Irw|Yes, Casper. This is Houston. Read you loud and clear.
100:09:08|T|CMP|Okay. Look like we got a - that 100 hours was a bad time, and I tried to close at him before he realized that it was all minus X. I put in about 3½ foot per second and got to checking. That didn't look like the right thing to do. So I took about 3 of that out, and -
100:09:31|T|CMP|I'm doing that, John.
100:09:31|T|CMP|- and so I took about three of that out, and I put in a half foot per second radial at about 100 hours and 5 minutes. And I put in the rest, took two foot per second posigrade at about 100 hours and 6 minutes. And at about 100 hours, then I put in three - it was about - roughly retrograde. And my computer now shows 16.5 by 9.2. And I had a good state vector when I started, and that's probably a good value - whenever you get a short arc or something on me.
100:10:11|C|Irw|Roger. We copy, Ken.
100:11:07|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We're wondering where you got the estimate of 0.7 nautical-mile range [1.3 kilometres].
100:11:24|C|Irw|No, that's fine.
100:11:30|T|CMP|Yeah, I show us now at about 0.9 mile [1.7 kilometres]. Is that correct?
100:11:38|T|CMP|Okay. And still opening?
100:12:14|C|Irw|Roger. We - we concur down here.
100:12:33|C|Irw|Okay, Casper; this is Houston. We're recommending that you null the line-of-sight range -
100:12:38|T|CMP|- ... Go ahead.
100:12:39|C|Irw|- and fire five feet per second toward the LM.
100:12:46|T|CMP|Okay. That's still going to be mostly retrograde, it looks like. That's how I got in this place to start with.
100:13:02|C|Irw|We copy you, Ken.
100:13:06|T|CMP|Okay, I'm going to hold. Can you guys get a short arc going on my trajectory?
100:13:35|C|Irw|Okay, Ken. We show you coming up on perilune now, so you'll be affecting your apolune.
100:13:47|T|CMP|You show me coming up on perilune?
100:13:49|C|Irw|That's affirmative.
100:13:50|T|CMP|Roger. My state vector shows 19 miles up [35 kilometres], and we're not - I'm just passing Smythii. is that - Does that sound reasonable, that we shifted that much in orbital track?
100:14:13|C|Irw|Okay. That sounds good, Ken.
100:14:27|T|CMP|Okay, I guess I'd like for you to - to summarize again where I stand. I'm a little bit confused now, Jim.
100:14:35|C|Irw|Roger. We were hoping that -
100:14:40|T|CMP|... I'm just passing Smythii, and my altitude according to my computer - Was my state vector a little bit off to start with?
100:14:52|C|Irw|We think your state vector was fairly accurate, Ken.
100:15:00|C|Irw|And you'll be at perilune in 15 minutes -
100:15:02|T|CMP|Okay, that makes more sense. All right. Because I'm presently at 19 miles, and I think that's probably a good estimate. All right. If I do - Do you want me to thrust towards the LM now, because I'm approaching perilune. Is that affirmative?
100:15:21|C|Irw|That's affirmative.
100:15:26|T|CMP|Okay. Now I'm - This is using up a great deal of RCS which is going to violate the next line. Is this preferable to trying to do a regular rendezvous now?
100:15:46|T|CMP|Because if we still have a chance at landing, then I need to ... to you -
100:15:46|C|Irw|Ken, could you give us your position, relative to the LM?
100:15:56|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I'm ahead of him and slightly below, and I show a - a mile [1.8 kilometres] on the EMS, and I don't know what John has on the radar.
100:16:23|T|CC-CM|Okay. We copy your position as ahead, below, and about one nautical mile.
100:16:31|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
100:16:37|C|Irw|Roger.
100:16:44|C|Irw|Okay. Stand by.
100:17:08|T|CMP|Okay, Jim. To make sure there's no confusion, I haven't done anything yet.
100:17:17|C|Irw|Okay. Stand by.
100:17:22|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
100:17:44|C|Irw|Okay, Casper. This is Houston. We're convinced that we want you to fire directly at the LM about 5 feet per second. We want to get a positive closing rate.
100:17:58|T|CMP|Okay. That's in work.
100:19:38|T|CMP|Okay. It looks like the DAP isn't stable now. How about if I give it a Verb 46?
100:19:45|C|Irw|Roger. We copy.
100:19:53|T|CMP|Is that a good idea?
100:20:02|C|Irw|Ken, we show you in Free.
100:20:06|T|CMP|I am now: but I wasn't.
100:20:09|C|Irw|Okay.
100:20:11|T|CMP|Does that mean I'm clear to do a Verb 46?
100:20:14|T|CMP|Okay. Oh, it still didn't work. I think maybe I've had one of those transients.
100:20:36|T|CMP|For some reason, every time I pick up CMC Auto, this thing - starts doing maneuvers.
100:20:58|C|Irw|Orion, let's go Lo Bit Rate.
100:21:11|C|Irw|Orion, let's go Lo Bit Rate.
100:21:12|T|CMP|Okay. I've got it under control, Jim. I had a bad DAP.
100:21:18|T|LMP|You have it.
100:22:00|T|CMP|Okay; we'll ... 5 feet per second directly at the LM.
100:22:11|C|Irw|Go.
100:22:34|C|Irw|Casper, this is Houston. Hold up on that RCS maneuver.
100:22:37|T|CMP|Okay. I've put in 3 feet per second.
100:22:38|C|Irw|Hold up, Ken.
100:22:47|C|Irw|Okay. Hold it there.
100:22:48|T|CMP|... Okay. Holding at three.
100:24:10|T|CMP|Thrust down means towards the Moon or down as you see it?
100:24:25|C|Irw|We need a range and range rate reading now.

100:24:49|T|CMP|Roger, Charlie. I'm standing by for instructions for best ...
100:25:05|C|Irw|Yes, Casper; this is Houston. You should null the line-of-sight rates.
100:25:13|T|CMP|Okay, do you want me to keep them nulled and go all the way in? Is that the idea?
100:25:17|C|Irw|Roger. Keep a positive closing rate.
100:25:24|T|CMP|Okay. It's likely to be expensive, but we'll do that.

100:32:54|C|Irw|Roger.
100:33:20|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. You're getting a line-of-sight rate. You're going to have to thrust a little toward the Moon.
100:33:29|T|CMP|Okay, let me try this.
100:33:32|C|Irw|Okay, we can't hold Hi Bit Rate. Request you go back to Lo Bit Rate, Orion.

100:37:17|T|CDR|Okay, well, you're at 4000 feet [1200 metres] now, at 5 feet [1.5 metres] a second, Ken.
100:37:21|T|CDR|And - and - and your line-of-sight rate is starting to build a little in the other direction. You've got it now.
100:37:22|T|CMP|Okay, hopefully, that's most of it.
100:37:54|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Is the CSM above you or below you? We hope he's directly ahead.
100:38:07|T|CDR|He's at 45 degrees above us.
100:38:11|C|Irw|: Forty-five degrees above.
100:38:15|T|CDR|Above the local vertical.
100:38:18|C|Irw|Roger.
100:38:29|T|CDR|And, he's got a - a 5-foot-a-second closing rate, and his line of sights are nulled on the radar.
100:38:34|C|Irw|Roger.
100:38:43|T|CMP|And they look like they are killed completely on the optics too. Going to need your tracker light here in a minute. We're just getting a little glinted sunlight now.
100:39:00|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
100:39:31|T|CMP|Boy, those rates look steady as they can be.
100:39:33|T|CDR|You've really got them killed.
100:39:51|T|CMP|Okay, and since we are going to get rendezvoused in the dark - I guess we'll just come up alongside and hold stations.
100:40:05|T|CDR|That seems like a fair thing.
100:40:09|T|CMP|All right, sir.
100:40:50|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. You're going to have to thrust down a hair.
100:40:57|T|CMP|That's down to you, right?
100:41:05|T|CMP|Yes ... Yes, that's what I mean, you would thrust - you would thrust up.
100:41:08|T|CMP|Okay. I think I got it killed again.
100:41:17|T|CMP|What's that closing rate now?
100:41:19|T|CDR|Looks pretty good. Still five feet a second. Still off 3½ feet [1.1 metres] a second now at 3000 [900 metres].
100:41:23|T|CMP|3½ feet per second.
100:41:26|T|CMP|Okay, all I've got's the tracking light; I've lost the rest of your image.
100:41:32|T|CDR|Okay. You've - you're gonna have to thrust a little more to kill that rate the same way.
100:41:48|T|CDR|Okay. That got a lot of it, but not all of it. Okay. You got most of it.
100:41:58|T|CC-CM/LM|Okay, Casper. This is Houston. You might pick up a temperature caution light on your quads, but it's of no consequence.
100:42:09|T|CMP|Okay. Yes, I see B is up high. Is that due to the thruster activity?
100:42:14|C|Irw|Affirmative, Ken.
100:42:15|T|CMP|Or is that due to heater fail-on?
100:42:19|C|Irw|I think it's thruster activity.
100:42:21|T|CMP|Okay. Roger.
100:42:28|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Will you give us another range and range rate, John?
100:42:35|T|CDR|Yep. They're at 3100 feet [950 metres], at 3½.
100:42:44|T|CDR|Roger. At an angle of 68 degrees to local vertical now.
100:42:50|C|Irw|Understand; 68 degrees.
100:43:33|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. You got a sight rate going to the south according to my needles.
100:43:51|T|CMP|Okay. Let's watch that for a minute before I start working on it, because we haven't had any plane component before.
100:43:58|T|CMP|How's the line-of-sight rate doing now? Holding?
100:44:05|T|CMP|Okay. And range rate?
100:44:02|T|CDR|Holding - holding the vertical, and it's holding right on. You're at 3000 feet [900 metres], at 3 feet [0.9 metres] a second.
100:44:17|T|CMP|Okay.
100:44:21|T|CMP|Now we must be going in the right direction then. Yeah.
100:44:25|T|CDR|Yeah, you're gonna get there. You now have 2 milliradians to the south. Yep.
100:44:39|T|CMP|Okay, I'll take some of that out. That means I go to the south, right?
100:44:49|T|CMP|How's that? Right direction?
100:44:51|T|CDR|Yeah, that's got most of it.
100:45:13|C|Irw|Go ahead.
100:45:21|T|CDR|You still got some more to the south you've got to get. Still 2 milliradians. Okay. That's got it, Ken.
100:45:32|T|CMP|Okay.
100:46:22|T|CMP|Okay, it looks like I'm picking up a rate in the opposite direction in the - - the in-plane component.
100:46:26|T|CDR|No, you're not - you're not - You don't have any rate yet. According to my needles.
100:45:32|T|CMP|Okay. All right.
100:46:43|T|CMP|This is very much like the simulator where, because of the dead band lags, it looks like it takes a long time to pick up one of those rates.
100:47:04|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We want you to get the rendezvous radar and the tracking light off as soon as it's feasible, to conserve power.
100:47:15|T|CDR|Roger. We will. It's not too feasible right now.
100:47:21|C|Irw|Yes, we understand.
100:47:36|T|CMP|Okay, it looks like I may be a little more to the south.
100:47:39|T|CDR|Just a hair, Ken. Okay. You're at 2400 feet [730 metres] at 2 [feet, 0.6 metres, per second].
100:47:46|T|CMP|Okay.
100:48:24|T|CMP|How about that rate to the south? It looks like it's building again. Okay.
100:48:29|T|CDR|Ken, our needles don't show it.
100:49:23|T|CMP|Hey, I show quite a drift rate now, John. Do you still show no out of plane?
100:49:29|T|CDR|Yeah, I don't show any, and I've got you boresighted in Att Hold, and I don't show any motion there either, Ken.
100:49:42|T|CDR|Just a little south, Ken.
100:49:44|T|CMP|Okay. It looks like it's pretty good bet. I'm going to take some of that out.
100:49:44|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Flight Director, Gerry Griffin, has instructed the CapCom to tell the crew that at acquisition of signal on Rev 15 - that's in spite of the next revolution - they'll be given a Go/No-Go for a landing on Rev 16. Hopefully be that time the situation will have resolved itself on the Thrust Vector Control System which drives the SPS. Apparently there is a problem in the yaw gimbal actuator in the Service Propulsion System. The decision has not yet been made, and hopefully will be made prior to the time of acquisition of signal on Revolution 15. Some 19 minutes remaining in this 14th revolution.

100:50:00|T|CMP|Can you tell if I'm going to - maybe I put that in the wrong direction, although I'm sure that that was the right - South is to your left, isn't it?
100:50:13|T|CMP|Okay. We're going the right way, then.
100:50:06|T|CDR|Whoa, Ken. You got it.
100:50:29|T|CMP|John, we've been going the right direction all along, then.
100:50:32|T|CDR|Yeah, you have. Yeah, don't worry about it.
100:50:34|T|CMP|It appears to be I'm still a little bit out of plane. I guess that's the sensitivity of the rendezvous radar.
100:51:17|T|CMP|Okay; how's my closure rate?
100:51:21|T|CDR|We're showing a foot a second on tapemeter. It isn't closing very fast.
100:51:24|T|CMP|Well, that's what I was just wondering. There could be a little more plus-X.
100:51:32|T|CMP|Okay, I'm going to put in a foot plus-X.
100:51:33|T|CDR|Okay. Say when and how much.
100:51:32|T|CMP|Okay? As long as we are using brute force, we might as well.
100:51:45|T|CDR|Okay.
100:52:00|T|CMP|Okay, that's about a foot.
100:52:01|T|CDR|Okay. You're at 2000 feet [600 metres] at 2 [feet per second, 0.6 metres, per second].
100:52:19|T|CDR|There you go. It worked.
100:52:22|T|CMP|How about that?
100:52:56|T|CMP|I can see the LM in Earthshine now.
100:53:03|T|CDR|Okay, fine.
100:53:14|T|CDR|You're getting over behind us, Ken. You're going to have to - to thrust toward us a little more.
100:53:19|T|CMP|Okay, what's my range rate now?
100:53:23|T|CDR|You're at 2000 feet, but it's hardly closing at all.
100:53:24|T|CMP|Okay, give me another foot.
100:53:34|T|CMP|Okay, there's another foot per second.
100:53:44|T|CDR|Okay.
100:53:55|T|CDR|Now you're starting to build a rate to the north.
100:54:04|T|CMP|I don't think those ... are as good as we're using them in here.
100:54:08|T|CDR|Yeah, I - I don't think they're quite as good.
100:54:12|T|CMP|It looks like I need to start reversing my in-plane direction.
100:54:20|T|CMP|Okay, do I still have a positive closure rate?
100:54:23|T|CDR|Yep, 3 feet a second; 2000 feet. 1800 feet now [550 metres].
100:54:27|T|CMP|Okay.
100:54:27|||<p class="tech"><b>100 54 XX Young (LM):</b> 1800 feet now.
100:55:39|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. There, you are moving north definitely.
100:55:42|T|CMP|Okay, I'm getting you centered back up in the COAS.
100:55:50|T|CDR|Okay.
100:56:13|T|CMP|Okay, do you guys still have a closure rate?
100:56:15|T|CDR|Say again?
100:56:15|||<p class="tech"><b>100 56 XX Mattingly:</b> Do I still have a closure rate?
100:56:18|T|CDR|That's affirmative; 2 feet a second.
100:56:18|||<p class="tech"><b>100 56 XX Mattingly:</b> Okay. Looks like the old EMS is just sort of sitting here looking at itself.
100:57:15|T|CMP|Okay, I'm going to go ahead and use the EMS - I mean the COAS on the sync because that's working out pretty good in here. Seems to be a more sensitive indicator of out of plane.
100:57:28|T|CDR|Okay, you've got 4 milliradians to the north. You're at 1500 feet now.
100:57:51|T|CMP|Okay. Just barely drifting in the COAS. It's pretty good here.
100:58:11|T|CDR|Okay; well, now, you have -
100:58:33|T|CMP|Yes, sir, in Earthshine I can see the whole LM now.
100:58:35|T|CMP|I'm afraid we're going to run out of Earthshine here before we get it completed. How's the closure rate now?
100:58:47|T|CDR|Still 2 feet a second, Ken. We're about 1400 feet [430 metres] now.
100:59:03|T|CMP|Okay. Man, that Moon in Earthshine is really something.
100:59:06|T|CDR|Okay; And I show you with 4 milliradians to the north, and I see you drifting slowly across the COAS to the north.
100:59:11|T|CMP|Roger. I didn't quite get it stopped.
100:59:30|T|CMP|That looks to me like that's fixed.
100:59:25|T|CDR|Okay, you're fixing it.
100:59:25|||<p class="tech"><b>100 59 XX Mattingly:</b> You still show some residuals?
100:59:36|T|CDR|Yeah, you're still 3 milliradians to the north.
100:59:36|||<p class="tech"><b>100 59 XX Mattingly:</b> Okay.
100:59:54|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We're showing about ten minutes to LOS, and I have some words for you on our general plan, when it's convenient.
100:59:54|||<p class="tech"><b>101 00 XX Irwin:</b> Okay, when you come up on AOS, on the next rev, Rev 15, we'll give you a Go or No-go for another try, and we'd be looking at PDI on Rev 16. And at that time, we'd have pads for you and procedures. Over.
101:00:29|T|CDR|Okay. Fair enough.
101:00:38|C|Irw|And, Casper; this is Houston.
101:00:43|T|CMP|Go right ahead.
101:00:46|C|Irw|Roger. We want you to verify that you're in Auto Dump on the water. That's Pressure Relief in the number 2 position. That's vertical. And if you have an opportunity to get away from the controls there, we'd like you to manually dump the water to ten percent on the back side. That should require about 17 minutes. Over.
101:01:08|T|CMP|Okay. I am in Auto Dump and I'll have to wait until we get in daylight to go down there, I think.
101:01:19|C|Irw|Okay, we copy.
101:01:20|T|CMP|I show about full, but I guess it isn't.
101:01:27|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. The line-of-sight rate is starting to - Have to thrust down a little - I mean, up a little.
101:01:41|T|CMP|Okay. How's my closure rate?
101:01:52|T|CDR|Two feet a second. You have it. You're at a thousand feet [300 metres] now, approaching ...
101:02:01|T|CMP|How's the out of plane?
101:02:02|T|CDR|It's starting to go to the south of here. Don't worry about it right now.
101:01:05|T|CMP|All right.
101:02:41|T|CDR|You got it, Ken. When you get in - when you get in -
101:02:50|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We would like you to configure for RCS Bravo only. Over.
101:02:58|T|LMP|Roger. We'll open the Cross Feed and pull Main SOV A.
101:03:12|T|LMP|We're configured.
101:04:15|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. You're about 990 feet [300 metres] now.
101:04:19|T|CMP|All righty.
101:04:38|T|CDR|970 [295 metres]. You've got the line-of-sight rate. Okay; can you see me with the spotlight yet?
101:04:50|T|CMP|No, that's what I was looking to see, because we're going to lose Earthshine here in just a minute.
101:05:39|T|CMP|Yeah, I'm not sure if that was the same ... you're talking about.
101:05:49|T|CMP|Does that fix it?
101:05:49|||<p class="tech"><b>101 05 XX Mattingly:</b> Right?
101:05:49|||<p class="tech"><b>101 05 XX Mattingly:</b> It's really strange, it was sitting here in the COAS here, right in the middle.
101:06:14|T|CDR|You thrust a hair down and a hair to the north.
101:06:18|T|CMP|You're upside down compared to me, and when you say down you mean you're going - you're going down on me - is that correct?
101:06:30|T|CDR|I'm doing it from the needles. If you don't ro - if you haven't rolled from the last way you were doing it, we were doing it okay.
101:06:44|T|CDR|Okay; it's 820 feet [250 metres] now.
101:06:52|T|CMP|Okay. It still doesn't seem like it does much. Okay; I show a line of-sight rate that's essentially killed.
101:08:04|T|CMP|One-four.
101:08:03|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
101:08:06|T|CMP|How much?
101:08:10|T|CMP|Okay, I can see your image is about 2 degrees, now.
101:08:29|C|Irw|16, this is Houston. We're showing about two minutes to LOS, now, if you'll give us a range and range rate, and, Ken, perhaps you could repeat it for us.
101:08:38|T|CDR|Okay; 710 feet [215 metres], closing at 2 feet a second, rates essentially nulled.
101:08:47|T|CMP|Did you copy that, Houston? The range is 710 feet, 2 feet per second, rates nulled. Houston, did you copy Casper?
101:09:12|C|Irw|Roger; we copied down here. Thank you.
101:09:19|T|CMP|Okay.
101:09:36|T|CMP|Uh huh. Let me turn my spotlight now.
101:09:54|T|CMP|Yeah, I can tell I got you, but it's a poor competitor for Earthshine.
101:10:02|T|CMP|Beg your pardon.
101:10:05|T|CMP|Roger. It will all of a sudden look very nice.
101:10:26|T|CMP|You can rendezvous under these conditions very nicely, the problem being that you've got to keep referring to the reticle to get some kind of range, I because there's just no - you still don't have enough good depth perception to tell where you are.
101:10:47|T|CMP|Okay, in order to have good comm, - man, you just disappeared - got the spotlight on. I tell you, the spotlight isn't nearly as good as Earthshine. I'm really surprised.
101:10:47|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have loss of signal with both vehicles as they pass behind the Moon during the end of revolution number 14. At the start of Revolution 15 the crew of Apollo 16 still at this time station-keeping in the two vehicles.

If the decision is [for a] go, all of the maneuver timelines will have to be read up to the crew during the front-side pass of revolution number 15. If the decision is [for] no landing, then the crew would proceed to rendezvous, dock, and prepare the spacecraft for return home. To recap the situation, the planned circularization maneuver by the Command Service Module back prior to AOS on Revolution 13 was aborted by Ken Mattingly when he discovered that the backup system, [in] the Stabilization and Control System which in turn controls the gimbal actuators on the Service Propulsion System, apparently had a malfunction in the yaw direction - in other words the driver that moves the engine bell left and right apparently had some excursions of several degrees and fairly rapid amplitude, [in] fairly rapid succession.

They will be given a Go/No-Go decision from the ground on whether or not to make the landing during the succeeding rev- revolution, or lunar orbit number 16. To recap again, the source of the current situation and delaying the landing, [is] the secondary, back up system, which actually acts as a tiller for the large 20,000 pound [89,000 newton] thrust engine in the Service Propulsion System, or the main engine on the Command Service Module, has experienced some difficulties in the yaw mode or the left and right motion of the engine.

Simulations at the manufacturer's plant in California and in the Command Module simulators here in Houston have been under way for the last several hours to determine the possible effects of having this oscillation - left to right oscillation - by the engine, whether or not it would damage the spacecraft structurally. Some initial times have been generated here by the Flight Dynamics people on the maneuvers for a landing should the decision be made to continue with the landing. The Command Module circularization burn would be made at 103:22:05. The Powered Descent Ignition [sic] or the start of the landing phase would be at 104:17:20 Ground Elapsed Time. These times are subject to change within a few seconds one way or another. To repeat again, some 11 minutes from now the two spacecraft will come around the front-side to start lunar orbit number 15. The spacecraft communicator will pass up to the crew the Go/No-Go decision for landing during revolution number 16. The crew has requested that if a landing is made that the EVA be postponed until after they can have a sleep period.

Kraft, Jr., just came back into the control center after having attended the meeting by management people in one of the back rooms, and the situation is Go for landing. To reaffirm we do have a Go for landing in revolution number 16. That decision will be passed up to the crew at acquisition of signal some seven minutes from now as they come around the front-side of the Moon.

101:59:22|T|CDR|We got AOS. Let's wait.
101:59:28|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston.
101:59:30|T|CDR|Hello, Houston.
101:59:36|C|Irw|Roger. I have some switches and circuit breakers we want you to take care of to try to improve the comm situation. I'll give them to you as soon as you're ready to copy.
101:59:47|T|LMP|Go ahead.
101:59:48|C|Irw|Okay, we want on Panel 12, Track Mode switch, Off; on Panel 16, Primary Transmitter/Receiver circuit breaker, Open; S-Band Antenna Heater Circuit breaker, Open; S-Band Antenna Comm circuit breaker, Open; and Primary S-Band Power Amplifier, Open. Then on panel 11, AC Bus S-Band Antenna, Open. Over.
102:00:15|T|LMP|Okay. Turn off the Track Mode on 12 - Track Mode, Off. Is that right, Jim?
102:00:36|C|Irw|That's right, Track Mode switch, Off, on Panel 12.
102:00:48|T|LMP|Okay, you'll have to find another name for that switch. Oh, okay, we got it.
102:00:56|C|Irw|It's been a long day. And did you copy those circuit breakers, Charlie?
102:01:07|T|CDR|Yeah, he's got them; we're getting them now.
102:01:10|C|Irw|Okay, and you do have a Go for another try here at PDI on Rev 16. And I have some words on that problem with the TVC whenever y'all are ready to copy.
102:01:26|T|LMP|Well, I'm all ears, I don't know about Ken.
102:01:28|T|CDR|Go to it.
102:01:36|C|Irw|Okay, Orion can always tell Casper what his problem is, but it looks like an open circuit in the rate feedback and your servo loop. We've run exhaustive tests down here on the West Coast and East Coast on controlability aspects and structural aspects, and everything looks satisfactory. On Apollo 9, we ran - a similar test was run, as you probably remember. And if such a - such a problem did occur up there, you could expect oscillations, of course, with the gimbal, but you could expect a steady attitude. It would be a limit cycle. So we're convinced down here that we have a satisfactory control mode if we have to revert to that one. Over.
102:02:38|C|Irw|And I hope Casper copied.
102:02:41|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, one thing -
102:02:42|T|CMP|Okay, Casper copied that. I - I guess I'd like to know, is that thing going to diverge up to a point and then cease to diverge? Does it become neutrally stable at some - some amplitude, Jim?
102:03:02|C|Irw|That's affirmative, Ken.
102:03:07|T|CMP|Okay, that must be some number bigger than the one I looked at, and the other question - only other question I had is: "Is there any connection between this, in your mind, and the - and the longer duration gimbal On times?
102:03:31|C|Irw|Okay, the answer to that, Ken, is negative.
102:03:38|T|CMP|Okay, sounds good. Thank you.
102:03:43|T|LMP|Jim, could you go through that switch list one more time - CB list one more time a little bit slower?
102:04:00|C|Irw|Okay, Charlie. On that circuit breaker list, on panel 16, it was Primary Transmitter and Receiver, S-Band Antenna Heater, S-Band Antenna Comm, Primary S-Band Power Amp. And then on panel 11, it was just one, AC Bus S-Band Antenna. Over.
102:04:15|T|LMP|Okay. We got them all.
102:04:24|C|Irw|Okay, understand that's complete.
102:04:29|T|LMP|That is complete. Roger.
102:04:31|C|Irw|Okay. Let me give you some words on the general plan here in this rev. We want to get the pads up to you, then we'll up-link, and then we want you to do a P52 Option 1. And then you'll pick up in the Timeline Book at circ.
102:04:51|T|LMP|Roger; copy.
102:04:54|C|Irw|And some more information, if you'd like to copy it; I have sunset at 102:35:50 and perform 400 plus 3 after the P52. And for the P52 use the same stars as the P52 in the Timeline Book. And, of course, after the up-links to you - Verb 47. Over.
102:05:24|T|LMP|Roger. We copy all of that. One thing - you want us to do Option 3 before the Option 1?
102:05:34|C|Irw|Negative; just the Option 1.
102:05:40|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, we're ready to copy.
102:05:45|C|Irw|Okay. We're standing by for the pads.
102:05:57|T|LMP|And -
102:05:58|C|Irw|Orion, will you turn S-Band Ranging switch Off?
102:06:06|T|LMP|Ranging is Off.
102:06:08|C|Irw|Let's go Hi Bit Rate.
102:06:16|T|LMP|You are Hi Bit Rate. Is Casper going to get a little sep maneuver here?
102:06:21|C|Irw|Yes, we'll be giving that, and I have T2, T3 aborts - pads, if you're ready to copy, Charlie.
102:06:33|T|LMP|Stand by. Okay. Go ahead.

102:11:54|C|Irw|Good readback, Charlie. I have AGS abort constants when you're ready.
102:11:59|T|LMP|Stand by. Okay, I'm ready to copy.
102:12:08|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. We're going to hold up. We've got to get some high bit rates. Orion, select Downvoice Backup.
102:12:44|T|LMP|Houston, how do you read Downvoice Backup? Over.
102:13:00|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. I read you very, very weak. We want you to go to P00 and Data. We're gonna send you some up-links, And we do not want you to transmit until the up-links are complete.
102:13:17|T|LMP|Understand. We have P00 and Data.
102:14:32|C|Irw|Orion, we want you to go to Downvoice Backup.
102:17:16|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston with the new Sep Pad and Circ Pad whenever you are ready.
102:17:25|T|LMP|Okay. We're still getting up-link.
102:17:31|C|Irw|Okay, no transmissions here.
102:17:41|C|Irw|You guys should maintain radio silence up there.
102:24:08|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. We have the up-links in, and I'm ready to give you the AGS abort constants.
102:24:17|T|LMP|Okay, stand by. Go ahead.
102:24:24|C|Irw|Okay, beginning with 224 plus 60529, plus 29402, plus 60406, plus 00572, minus 32664, minus 54401. And we want you to reload 373 with plus 08574 and change 254 to plus 08817. Over.
102:25:06|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. We copy starting with 224, 60529, 29402, 60406, 00572, 32664, 54401. Load 373 with plus 08574; 254 plus 08817. Over.
102:25:36|C|Irw|That's a good readback, and, of course, 662 and 673 are minus.
102:25:42|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
102:25:49|C|Irw|Okay, and I have the Sep Pad and Circ Pad if you' re ready.
102:25:54|T|LMP|Go ahead.
102:26:07|C|Irw|Okay, Sep Pad is at 102.30, all zeros. And on this Circ Pad, ignition 103:21:42.43, Noun 81 plus 0069.1, plus all zeros, minus 0043.5. Over.
102:26:28|T|LMP|Okay. Hopefully, that's a Sep Pad. Ken got 103:21:43; plus 0006.9 - correction, plus 0069.1, minus all bails, minus 0043.5. Over.
102:26:50|C|Irw|Roger. That's the - the Circ Pad. The other - the first one was the Sep Pad.
102:26:57|T|LMP|Okay, just the T<sub>ig</sub>. Okay, we're gonna get to work - start loading these AGS stuff.
102:27:05|C|Irw|Okay, and after you load those AGS abort constants, you'll be clear to pick up on the Timeline Book at the circ burn.
102:27:17|T|LMP|Roger. After the P52.
102:27:27|T|CDR|Ask them for a new DAP load or new DAP weight - it doesn't make any difference.
102:27:33|T|LMP|Why don't - why don't you do that, John, while I -
102:27:35|T|CDR|Okay.
102:27:38|T|LMP|- I think we're all right, but I got to load this stuff.
102:27:39|T|CDR|Houston, do we have a new LM DAP weight?
102:27:41|C|Irw|Stand by.
102:27:43|T|CDR|Or is that worth fooling with?
102:27:48|T|LMP|... when we pitch up like this, I feel like I'm going backwards - in an orb or in an inertial pull.
102:28:06|T|CDR|Kind of got your ...
102:29:10|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We'd like you to open AC Bus A Tape Recorder on Panel 11.
102:29:17|T|CDR|Okay. It's coming open.
102:29:22|C|Irw|And I have a PIPA bias for you -
102:29:23|T|CDR|Okay, it's open.
102:29:24|C|Irw|- when you're ready to copy.
102:29:30|T|LMP|Stand by. Whew. Go ahead.
102:29:40|C|Irw|Okay. Address 1456. Data, 03141. Over.
102:29:54|T|LMP|Okay, 1456. Say again the data.
102:29:56|C|Irw|03141. Over.
102:30:04|T|LMP|Roger; 1456 address, 03141.
102:30:07|C|Irw|Good readback.
102:30:08|T|LMP|We' re entering that now. Verb 21 Noun 0 - Noun 01 Enter, 1456 Enter, load 0314 - 03141.
102:30:31|T|LMP|Good number, I guess, huh? ...
102:30:50|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We'd like you to open the Up Data Link circuit breaker on panel 11 and go to Normal voice configuration.
102:31:01|T|LMP|Roger. Data Link.
102:31:28|T|LMP|Okay, Houston; Orion. How do you read Normal voice? Over.
102:31:30|C|Irw|Very good. Much better, Charlie.
102:31:35|T|LMP|Okay.
102:31:42|T|CDR|Okay. Can you say something about our trajectory now? Are we still 17,000 feet [5000 metres] south and the same as before?
102:31:51|C|Irw|Stand by, John. We'll have some words for you.
102:31:56|T|CDR|Okay.
102:32:07|T|CDR|And I assume you want to use both systems for PDI, both RCSs.
102:32:13|C|Irw|We're still talking about that down here, John.
102:32:17|T|CDR|Okay.
102:32:45|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. At the present time, it looks like you will be coming in 16,000 feet [4800 metres] high and about 20,000 feet 6000 [metres] south,
102:32:54|T|CDR|Okay, understand. 16,000 high and 20,000 south.
102:33:01|C|Irw|Roger.
102:33:04|T|LMP|Jim, John and I are just laughing. We'd like to go back to the sims, please.
102:33:14|C|Irw|So would we.
102:33:21|T|LMP|Glad you turned the biomed off.
102:33:42|T|CDR|Houston, okay to do that P52 now?
102:33:54|T|CDR|Houston, are we clear to do the P52 now?
102:33:59|C|Irw|Roger; as soon as you're in darkness, John. Well, just an, advisory, it's Option 1.
102:34:05|T|CDR|Understand. Option 1 and we're going to gyro torque it.
102:34:12|C|Irw|Roger.
102:39:06|T|LMP|Jim, entered the P52. We've got you on the Aft omni now.
102:39:09|C|Irw|Roger. We copy.
102:39:19|T|LMP|That new REFSMMAT was pretty close to the old one - just a couple of degrees, right?
102:39:22|C|Irw|Affirmative.
102:39:32|T|LMP|Man, when those jets turn on, Jim, nobody had ever commented before, but it really horses this old thing around.
102:39:40|C|Irw|Roger.
102:39:59|C|Irw|Okay. Orion, this is Houston. We have another procedure we wanted you to try for the comm problem.
102:40:07|T|LMP|Go ahead.
102:40:08|C|Irw|Okay, we want you to open the Secondary Power AMPs circuit breaker on Panel 11. And, of course, you'll lose comm when you open that; and then after one minute, close it, and then we'll re-establish comm.
102:40:28|T|LMP|Roger; copy. We'll do that after John finishes marking.
102:40:37|C|Irw|Okay.
102:43:47|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. How do you read me?
102:43:51|T|LMP|Loud and clear.
102:43:55|C|Irw|Oh, you're loud and clear too.
102:44:02|C|Irw|Roger; could you give us the - your Noun 93s? We'd - had lost data at that point.
102:44:10|T|LMP|Yeah, sorry about that, Jim. Here they are: the star angle difference was 4 balls 1, minus 4 balls 1; our torque angles were minus 0.067, plus 0.108, plus 0.050; torqued at 104:42:25.
102:44:31|C|Irw|Roger. Copied down to Noun 93 is minus 0.067 plus, 0.108, plus 0.050. Over.
102:44:42|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
102:45:30|T|CDR|Hey Houston, I don't know where Ken is at this point when we missed up into our P52. I trust he is still keeping an eye on us.
102:45:40|C|Irw|I hope so too.
102:45:41|T|CDR|Hey, Ken.
102:46:20|C|Irw|And, Orion; this is Houston. Just a reminder on the 400 plus 3, and a Verb 47.
102:46:31|T|LMP|Roger; we already did that.
102:46:33|C|Irw|Okay; very good.
102:47:14|C|Irw|Charlie, this is Houston. Could you put your mike a little closer? Your volume seems to be a little lower than - than John's.
102:47:26|T|LMP|Okay; how's that?
102:47:28|C|Irw|That's better.
102:47:32|T|LMP|Okay; I had one of them up. Every time I turn my head I get orange juice.
102:47:39|C|Irw|Roger.
102:47:50|T|LMP|It's delicious, Jim, but it's better in your mouth than floating around the cockpit.
102:47:55|C|Irw|I know what you mean. I wish I had some.
102:48:00|T|LMP|As a matter of fact, I've already had an orange shampoo with the helmet on.
102:48:09|C|Irw|I guess that's better than no shampoo.
102:48:15|T|LMP|Yeah, I think you're right. Jim, we were really impressed with that landing site from ten miles, anyway, it sure looks exactly like the LMA.
102:48:32|C|Irw|Okay, Charlie. We're kind of curious about the orange juice problem. Did you have a - a bag failure?
102:48:39|T|LMP|Well, I think it must be the valve. The Command Module water had a lot of air bubbles in it and when I - of course, when I put my suit on, it sort of compressed everything. And every time my mike comes by and grabs the - the valve, it bends it down just slightly, which is - which is enough to cause some to squirt out due to the pressure from the suit. Over.
102:49:04|C|Irw|We copy.
102:49:10|T|CDR|I have the same problem all the time in one g.
102:49:15|T|LMP|Yeah, at one g though, you bend over and it's on your visor and you can lick it off.
102:49:59|T|LMP|Casper, Orion transmitting VHF A Simplex. How do you read?
102:50:09|C|Irw|Charlie, this is Houston. We're kind of concerned about how much -

102:50:13|C|Irw|- orange juice might have spilled out. We're concerned about the amount that might have got in the suit loop and its effect on the LiOH canister.
102:50:25|T|LMP|Jim, most of it, for some reason floated up under my helmet - I mean my Snoopy hat, and I'm pretty sticky around the temples and all; and I don't think anything - most of it stuck right in my helmet. And the suit loop flow is not enough to drive it down under - into the suit. And I don't feel like I'm wet at all down in that area. Over.
102:50:49|C|Irw|Okay; thank you, Charlie.
102:51:03|T|CDR|Yeah, I don't - I don't think there is any of it in the suit loop to amount to anything. Looking at Charlie, I can tell where most of it is.
102:51:27|T|LMP|Yes, Ken, I was just seeing how you read. We're all set to go for your circ. Okay, what kind of sep maneuver did you do? All right, thank you.
102:51:55|C|Irw|Orion, let's try Biomed, Left.
102:52:02|T|LMP|Okay, you got John's arrhythmia.
102:52:05|C|Irw|Roger.
102:52:53|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. I'd like to confirm that in System A we have enough ullage volume to get all the propellants out of the tank. Over.
102:53:02|C|Irw|That's not correct, Charlie, we'll give you the exact number here shortly.
102:53:12|T|LMP|Okay, we're still looking at 2000 - about 2100 psi [14500 kPa] on the helium.
102:54:37|C|Irw|Orion, this - this is Houston. In answer to your question, Charlie. If you were to lose source pressure right now, you could get 35 percent out.
102:54:50|T|LMP|Okay; well, we only have 50 - 50 percent remaining.
102:54:55|C|Irw|Understand. And that 35 percent is enough to complete this mission.
102:55:02|T|LMP|Okay. if we could - Do we have a double failure here on the two regs and that loop?
102:55:07|C|Irw|That's affirmative.
102:55:14|T|LMP|Okay. So what's holding us is that check valve that unseats at 2 - about 225 and reseats at 212?
102:55:25|C|Irw|That's correct, Charlie. And really you have - should have about 60 percent in that system. Your gage has an error in it.
102:55:35|T|LMP|We copy. Roger; we copy.
103:01:26|T|LMP|Houston, Orion.
103:01:27|C|Irw|Go ahead, Orion.
103:01:31|T|LMP|Roger, Jim. We watched Ken's waste water dump, and I can see why that thing really gives FDO fits. It really comes out of there like a water hose.
103:01:44|C|Irw|Okay; we copy.
103:01:45|T|LMP|And we took a picture of it, or two, and I hope they come out and show you that. We had pretty good lighting.
103:01:54|C|Irw|Good; we hope you have some good pictures of it. And we're showing about two minutes and a half to LOS.
103:02:03|T|LMP|Roger; AOS time, please.
103:02:06|C|Irw|Stand by.
103:02:23|C|Irw|AOS for Rev 16 is 103:51:25.
103:02:27|T|LMP|Roger.
102:04:04|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're on two loops now.
102:04:13|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. Thank you.
102:04:16|C|Roo|Hey, Ken, I've got a couple other words about that if you'd like to listen.
102:04:26|T|CMP|I surely would, Stu.
102:04:27|C|Roo|Okay. Most of the cases where they appeared to be diverging to you and you shut it off the motor, would short, and some of them was just very close to the point at which it became stable. And on some of the - the longer ones, we did see the stability, but those that you called as diverging were short of reaching this stable point, it appears that the controllability is not going to be any problem when - If you would have to burn with this, according to the stroking tests on 9, you'll get a lot of - of oscillations and you'll feel the spacecraft shaking, but the attitude will not be changing. You'll probably see the rate needles moving around a little bit. And just for your info also, most probably do the burns with the 90 degree roll, so we'll have a - so we'll have the redundancy in the - in the yaw axis platform consideration.
102:05:43|T|CMP|That sounds like a good plan. Now, I guess if I'd have been a little smarter, we'd have pressed on on schedule.
102:05:49|C|Roo|No, I don't think so, Ken. They - they appeared to be diverging and it was a - it was a true divergence as far as you could tell. It - it was just, in most cases, just short of becoming stable.
102:06:09|T|CMP|Okay, I tell you - you know the difference in this and the simulator, where you can really feel it move, and this old dog was really wagging its tail.
102:06:14|C|Roo|Yes. You know, Jim was talking about the Apollo 9 test, and he said that - that they really - you really feel it in the spacecraft. But this thing is stable. They have - they've really checked that out, and it'll rattle and roll a little bit, if you have to use it, but it's stable.
102:06:37|T|CMP|Sounds good. Once again, the ground earns their pay.
102:06:56|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, I guess I'm in need of a general outline of where we intercept the Flight Plan. And it looks like one of the things I'll be needing is a - some kind of a separation burn from Orion again, so that I'm not setting here blasting it into his face. And then I'll need a certain burn pad. And after that, I'll - I guess we just sort of stumble along and try to pick up some landmark tracking and things like that.
102:07:27|C|Roo|Okay -
102:07:28|T|CMP|My fuel is kind of low.
102:07:33|C|Roo|Okay, of course, as you know, we're working the Flight Plan now, and Hank's got the - the pads for you. And I just wanted to make one other comment now. Do you have any other questions - do you have any reservations about this duty, because we sure want to get - get your concurrence? But everything looks like it's - it's go.
102:07:58|T|CMP|Okay. Did somebody fly one of these in the CMS?
102:08:02|C|Roo|Well, But - it's been flown on the hardware evaluator.
102:08:11|T|CMP|Okay, I just want to get - if anyone's -
102:08:13|C|Roo|Yeah.
102:08:14|T|CMP|- run one of these things in the manual MTVC or something like that.
102:08:22|C|Roo|Okay, yeah. They - it's been flown, in all three - three modes, Ken, G&amp;N, SCS Auto and MTVC. It's also been flown on the -
102:08:35|T|CMP|Roger.
102:08:36|C|Roo|- on the hardware evaluator, and - and, of course, we did have the stroking test on Apollo 9, where it was flown in front, and pretty much duplicated this exact problem as far as cycles per second, so forth.
102:08:55|T|CMP|All right, sir. I'm happy.
102:08:59|C|Roo|Very good. And Hank's got some good words here for you here.
102:09:06|C|Har|Okay, Ken. I have your -
102:09:07|T|CMP|Thank you very much.
102:09:08|C|Har|- Sep Pad for you. You'll use normal sep procedures. In other words, you'll be below the LM, facing it, and back away with your minus-X thrusters. I'll read you your new pad, if you're ready to copy.
102:09:23|T|CMP|Okay, just a second. I got my pad book handy.
102:09:47|T|CMP|Okay, I'm ready for a little Sep Pad.
102:09:57|C|Har|Roger. Noun 33, 102:30, all zip; attitude 000, 357, 000.
102:10:10|T|CMP|Okay, this is sep. That's at 102:30:00; attitude 000, 357, and 000.
102:10:22|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
102:10:24|T|CMP|And this is to be a - a one-foot-per-second radial inward.
102:10:33|C|Har|That's affirmative.
102:10:47|T|CMP|Okay.
102:11:05|C|Har|And I have your Circ Pad for you now, Ken, if you're ready to copy.
102:11:17|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
102:11:18|C|Har|Roger. Circ, SPS/G&amp;N; 39095; plus 0.49, plus 1.19; 103:21:42.43; Noun 81, plus 0069.1, all zips, minus 0043.5; 000, 139, 358; 0068.0, plus 0053.1; 0081.6, 0:05, 0070.1. The rest is NA. Sirius and Rigel; 131, 071, 014. Two jets; 16 seconds; quads Alfa and Charlie. And in comments: manually roll 90 degrees from pad attitude for burn, except the final attitude and trim in P40.
102:13:08|T|CMP|Okay. Let me ask one question before I read it back. I assume that I would be outsmarting myself if I went through the 90-degree roll in the Verb 49 maneuver rather than going to zero roll. I'm looking for ways to kind of be stingy with the RCS.
102:13:32|C|Har|Stand by one.
102:13:37|T|CMP|Let me read you the pad back now and then ask you the questions, Hank.
102:13:40|C|Har|Okay.
102:13:44|T|CMP|Okays it's circ, SPS/G&amp;N; 39095; plus 0.49, plus 1.19; 103:21:42.43; plus 0069.1, all zips; minus 0043.5, 000, 139, 358; 0068.0, plus 0053.1; 0081.6, 0:05, 0070.1. Sirius and Rigel; 131, 071, 014. Two jets, 16 seconds; quads Alfa and Charlie. Manually roll 90 degrees for burns.
102:14:35|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
102:15:27|T|CMP|And would you like for me to go to A/C Roll for the normal roll coming up to control?
102:15:33|C|Har|Ken, there's too much noise. Can you say it again.
102:15:39|T|CMP|Would you like for me to go to A/C Roll for normal roll control also?
102:15:43|C|Har|Stand by. That's affirmative, Ken. Go to A/C Roll.
102:15:52|T|CMP|Okay.
102:16:11|C|Har|Ken, we're trying to work in a P52 here, and we're checking that attitude, and then we'll give you what we think is best as far as that maneuver. .
102:16:22|T|CMP|Okay.
102:17:20|T|MCC|Hey, tell him not to talk now, because they're hitting the data then every time now in Downvoice Backup.
102:18:41|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Between now and sep we're not going to do anything. In the meantime, FAO is working on a - whether the burn attitude is going to be good for your P52 or not. So just go ahead, get sep out of the way and we'll have some words for you then.
102:18:59|T|CMP|Okay, looks like I could use a new state vector, too.
102:19:04|C|Har|Roger. They are working on the vectors now.
102:19:10|T|CMP|Okay, will it do me any good to load - Yeah, I can go ahead and load this thing and let them put in a new vector later. Is that correct?
102:19:19|C|Har|Say again.
102:19:23|T|CMP|Is it okay to go ahead and load P30 and then out in a new vector afterwards, or is it best to wait until I get the vectors in?
102:19:31|C|Har|Stand by a minute, Ken.
102:19:42|C|Har|Ken, go ahead and sep. We'll up-link after sep.
102:19:47|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
102:20:57|T|CMP|How about if I do this 90 degrees to that attitude to save - save the maneuver. I'll have to go pretty fast to get there.
102:21:08|C|Har|I guess I didn't understand your question, Ken.
102:21:09|T|CMP|I'm almost 90 degrees to that attitude and I could do it. Instead of pointing and doing it along the X-axis, suppose I come down and do this 90 degrees out and do it with the B/D thruster? Put in that one foot per second?
102:21:29|C|Har|Stand by, Ken.
102:21:32|T|CMP|That'd get me a - a pitch attitude of 085 - or 087, excuse me.
102:23:26|C|Roo|Okay. Now, he loaded - he loaded his P30 and you're looking at -
102:23:50|T|CMP|Stu, you were on air to ground. I've loaded P30, and I have flown to 90 degrees from the attitude in order to save that extra high-speed maneuver to get there. And I'm going to burn it along the Z-axis. It'll be towards the Moon, which is our check, and I'll take it from 1 foot per second to 2 foot per second as per the normal procedures, except I'll be using the Z-translation.
102:24:26|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We concur as long as it's 1-foot down radial.
102:24:31|T|CMP|Okay, it'll be 1 foot towards the Moon, and we'll still count from 1 to 2 foot per second on the Noun 85.
102:24:40|C|Har|Roger.
102:26:15|C|Har|Casper, you a Go for sep.
102:26:25|T|CMP|Okay; go for sep. Thank you, sir.
102:27:27|C|Har|Just to clarify, Ken. You're going to burn the Noun 85 to zero.
102:27:36|T|CMP|Negative; the Noun 85 will go to plus 2. It was loaded so that it would point you in the other direction, and by taking it this way, I'll - the dummy load we put in was a - a minus, and we normally burned it to a plus 2. I'm going to burn towards the Moon, which is going to make this come out to be plus 2.
102:28:37|T|CMP|We originally put in a vector. We wanted to burn radially inward, and we put in a vector that was - would cause you to point radially outward on the calculations and then we just burned it to a larger number. So P40 wouldn't - wouldn't cause you to turn around and point 180 from where you were when you undock.
102:28:58|C|Har|Roger; copy.
102:29:03|T|CMP|Do you have any reservations?
102:29:07|C|Har|Long as you get a foot toward the Moon.
102:29:12|T|CMP|Okay. We can do that.
102:29:33|T|CMP|Okay. Inside of 30 seconds.
102:30:38|T|CMP|Okay; how's that?
102:30:48|C|Har|Looks okay, Ken.
102:32:43|C|Har|Casper, Houston. If you'll give us Accept, we'll up-link.
102:32:50|T|CMP|You have it.
102:32:59|C|Har|And, Casper, when you get through with the up-links I we want to go to an attitude of 000, 060, 000 and do a P52.
102:33:11|T|CMP|Okay, 000, 060, and 000 and a P52, option 3. And I take it that I should enter 509 just before the P52, and leave it in until after the gimbal drive check in P40. The same procedure we had last time. Is that affirmative?
102:33:40|C|Har|That's affirmative.
102:33:44|T|CMP|All righty.
102:36:31|C|Har|Casper, the computers are yours.
102:36:38|T|CMP|Thank you.
102:37:46|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're trying to troubleshoot the LM communications problems and it will help if you go to omni Alfa.
102:45:30|C|Har|Casper, we have a Noun 93.
102:45:39|T|CMP|Okay.
102:45:41|C|Har|And, Ken, what we would like for you to do is pick up in the Flight Plan at 97:07, and with the circ preps, and just step on through that, procedure-wise, and be sure you do the Verb 49 after the circ. I have a change in your pad attitude -
102:46:02|T|CMP|You said Verb 29, what first to take?
102:46:06|C|Har|Roger. Right after the circ burn, want to be sure you do the Verb 49. And, to get it into the landmark tracking attitude, we're going to do the high-altitude landmark tracking. And we've got a change to your pad attitude for your circ. We're going to go ahead and give you an attitude that has the 90 degrees in it, so the Verb 49 will be more efficient. And the new attitude is 090, 139, 358.
102:46:39|T|CMP|Okay; 090, 139, and 358. I'm on my way now. And I'll get myself into the proper tracking attitude if we don't get all those things worked out.
102:46:50|C|Har|Roger. And we want to make sure you don't bypass the final trim in P40, in that attitude.
102:46:59|T|CMP|That's affirmative. I will take the final trim.
102:47:03|C|Har|Roger. And somewhere in here I need to give you the new abort pads, whenever you can get the chance to copy them.
102:47:10|T|CMP|Okay. Let me get the maneuvers started, and let me get myself squared away and get the time line in my head and then I'll give you a call.
102:27:16|C|Har|Okay; whenever you're ready.
102:48:32|T|CMP|Okay, Hank; and one question that comes to my mind is, do you want the secondary yaw gimbal brought on the line or not?
102:48:47|C|Har|Stand by, Ken. I'll get you an answer on that one.
102:49:18|C|Har|Okay, Ken, what we'd like for you to do is leave the secondary gimbal motors off until you have finished the gimbal drive check, then bring the secondary gimbal motors on, and do a normal burn. And if you have to, go ahead and down grade, down mode, if you have to to arrest some kind of a bad rate or something.
102:29:42|T|CMP|Okay. I'll not do - I'll do the gimbal drive check with the secondary in pitch - unless - Are they in the same package? It seems like they're in separate packages. The secondary in yaw is the one I'll bring on after the gimbal drive check.
102:49:59|C|Har|That's okay, Ken.
102:50:01|T|CMP|Or would you rather just not exercise it. It's macht's nicht to me.
102:50:09|C|Har|It's your druthers, Ken. If you want to do it that way, that's fine.
102:50:19|T|CMP|Okay. It'll just verify that I've got everything else hooked up properly. I'd like to keep as close to the normal procedures as I can. Hey, you did copy the P52 things?
102:50:31|C|Har|Roger. It looked good. And Orion's trying to call you on VHF.
102:50:38|T|CMP|Okay, I had turned them off while we were doing our chatter. Let me get to them.
102:50:44|T|CMP|Orion, Casper.
102:51:25|T|CMP|Orion, did you call Casper?
102:51:33|T|CMP|Okay. We'll give it a try again, I did a 1-foot-per-second radial in towards the Moon.
102:52:29|C|Har|And, Ken; in addition to the pads, I also have you LOS and AOS time.
102:52:45|T|CMP|Okay.
102:53:47|C|Har|Casper, Houston. How do you read?
102:53:52|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
102:53:53|C|Har|Okay, we lost you there a minute.
102:53:59|T|CMP|Okay. Do you want another omni?
102:54:04|C|Har|Stand by.
102:54:59|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're about 9 minutes from LOS, and I sure would like to get these pads up when I ever - you get a chance.
102:55:09|T|CMP|Okay. Can I catch them when we get AOS, Hank? These are all the abort pads, right.
102:55:17|C|Har|Okay. And - but let me give you the LOS and AOS.
102:55:24|T|CMP|Okay; go ahead.
102:55:25|C|Har|Roger. LOS is 103:04:54; AOS, 103:51:25. Are you interested in sunrise?
102:55:42|T|CMP|No, sir. That's all right, thank you. Yeah, let me concentrate on making sure that it all goes well in time, Hank. And I'll pick up those abort pads at AOS.
102:55:52|C|Har|Roger.
102:56:03|C|Har|Omni Delta, 16, or Casper.
102:57:43|T|CMP|And, Houston; Casper.
102:57:49|C|Har|Go ahead.
102:57:55|T|CMP|One thing on the plus side, Hanks, is Charlie took a look at the mass spec and says that it's all inside and buttoned up.
102:58:05|C|Har|He said the mass spec is all inside and buttoned up?
102:58:11|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
102:58:12|C|Har|Okay. I'll relay that.
102:58:26|T|CMP|Okay, and I took the trim maneuver in P40 and I put that bias to Attitude B, 90 degrees roll, 139 pitch, and 1.7 in yaw, and that's about right, considering the roll.
102:58:44|C|Har|Roger.
103:01:54|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
103:01:58|T|CMP|Go ahead.
103:02:00|C|Har|Roger. You have a Go for circ, and when you come up on - at AOS next time we'd like you to come up in the landmark tracking attitude that is giving us 98.22. That's a little different from the Verb 49 maneuver that's called out right after the circ burn. It's different in roll. In fact, you should be in attitude 000, 276, 000. And we want you to do your Verb 49 to that attitude: 000, 276, 000, rather than a roll of 060 as it calls for there right after the circ burn.
103:02:41|T|CMP|Okay. I'll pick you up on the best antenna.
103:02:46|C|Har|Roger. Omni D, Omni Delta.
103:02:51|T|CMP|Okay, thank you, Hank.
103:02:58|C|Har|Ken, we'd like to know if you did a purge when you did the waste water dump.
103:03:05|T|CMP|A purge? A fuel cell purge? No, sir.
103:03:10|C|Har|Okay, copy. You didn't purge fuel cells.
103:03:15|T|CMP|No, that's correct.
103:04:29|C|Har|Ken, if you can work it in, don't jeopardize the burn. Maybe after the burn you can get a urine dump and purge on all those things so we can get the SIM bay going later. That's okay, but if you can't work it in, don't - don't jeopardize anything
103:04:47|T|CMP|Okay, I'll get you a purge in there, anyhow.
104:17:23|P|PAO|And we've had loss of signal as Apollo 16 spacecraft Orion and Casper have passed behind the Moon. Nearing the end of lunar orbit 15, some 47 minutes before spacecraft come around for the 16th revolution and subsequent landing which is now scheduled for Ground Elapsed Time of - actually the ignition for PDI, Powered Descent Initiation will be at 104:17:23 with the landing some 12 minutes later. The powered descent will have a total velocity change of 6,703 feet [2,043 metres] per second. The crew has been advised - that is the crew of Orion - that they will be about 16,000 feet [5,000 metres] high above the normal flight path at the time of powered descent, and some 20 000 feet [6,000 metres] south of track. However, the Lunar Module guidance system will guide the spacecraft to take these discrepancies [out and make a ] normal landing. After landing the crew will then have a sleep period prior to beginning the first EVA which at this time is scheduled to begin at 118 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time or about 10:30 a.m. tomorrow morning Central Time.

Such factors as the consumables remaining such as battery power et cetera in the Lunar Module will have an effect on this decision. To go back and recapitulate, the reasons for the delay in landing was [that] Ken Mattingly, on his circularization burn during revolution number 13, experienced a oscillation in the yaw mode for the Service Module engine during checkout and it turns out that the secondary servo loop or one of the circuits for the yaw gimbal drive which can be controlled by either the G&amp;N system or the Stabilization and Control System (which is a backup mode) apparently had this oscillation in it. Subsequent simulations and tests here and across the country have found that there is no potential structural hazard to the spacecraft even if it were necessary to go to the mode where there might be some chatter oscillation in the yaw gimbal. [The] Gimbal is the yoke on which the engine is mounted; one for pitch and one for yaw and the thrust vector control system in effect acts as a tiller for turning the engine much as you would use a handle on an outboard motor to direct the thrust of the propeller.

103:53:17|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. How do you read?
103:53:23|T|CDR|Loud and clear, Jim.
103:53:25|C|Irw|Okay. I have a couple of comm procedures for you -
103:53:27|T|CDR|Okay. Jim, I -
103:53:29|C|Irw|- on Panel 12, will you get the Function switch to Range; and on Panel 11, Updata Link circuit breaker closed.
103:53:41|T|CDR|Updata Link is closed, Function switch to Range.
103:53:45|C|Irw|Roger. And I'm standing by for your report.
103:53:49|T|LMP|And, Jim - Okay, we got the Ascent Bats On at 103:42. The ED bats are Go at 37 volts.
103:53:58|C|Irw|Roger; copy. The Ascent Bats 103:42, and ED bats are good. And I have a PDI ephem update -

103:56:33|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
103:56:35|C|Irw|Roger. John, you can anticipate a slight roll transient at ignition because of c.g. position; and, on the RCS, of course, we'll want normal configuration. And your RCS quantity System A is off because of the high pressure in that system. It's off by about 13 percent.
103:56:56|T|CDR|Okay.
103:56:57|C|Irw|In other words, you have 13 percent more than indicated.
103:57:01|T|CDR|Understand.
103:57:33|C|Irw|Orion, do you have a Verb 33 on the DSKY?
103:57:38|T|CDR|That's affirmative.

104:00:37|C|Irw|Roger.
104:01:42|T|LMP|Jim, could we yaw right a little bit and point that omni right at you, would that help?
104:01:48|C|Irw|Stand by.
104:03:07|T|LMP|Okay. Any words on that up-link, Jim?
104:03:10|C|Irw|Why don't you put in that yaw maneuver; yaw right 20 degrees, that might help.
104:03:19|T|LMP|Roger.
104:03:32|T|CDR|Here's yaw right 20.
104:03:34|C|Irw|Roger.

104:03:38|C|Irw|Looks like we're getting good data now, Charlie. Stand by. We're up-linking now.
104:04:25|T|LMP|Okay, Jim. I think we'll start the - John says we'll start the PDI from zero yaw since the omni is pointing right at you. That be better for you?
104:04:35|C|Irw|Stand by.
104:04:39|C|Irw|Okay, Orion. We're finished with your computer.
104:04:47|T|LMP|Okay.

103:52:23|C|Har|Hey, good show, you want to give us a report?
103:52:35|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, the burn was on time and for the right duration. And the residuals were plus 0.2, plus 0.2, and 0. That was after a trim: and the attitude for those residuals was 161.38, 132.96, and 0.12. Delta-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 8.5; the oxidizer is 32; the fuel is 34; and the decrease-increase is pegged at decrease, probably because of the short duration. The burn required a trim. The original residuals were plus 1 and plus 0.6 and plus 0.7. So I had to roll in order to take out the Z-components.
103:53:46|C|Har|Roger; and would you give us the trim attitude again, please.
103:53:59|T|CMP|Okay, I'll give you again the trim attitude, and this is for these 210 residuals. That's after trimming, that was 161.38, 132.96, and 0.12.

103:59:10|C|Har|That was a good readback, Ken. And Stu would like to give you some words on the rendezvous.
103:59:16|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. I got a couple of comments about - in the event of a PDI abort as far as the rendezvous scheme. And you might want a sheet of paper there to jot down a couple of things.
103:59:30|T|CMP|Okay; I got a little corner here.
103:59:31|C|Roo|Okay, we're going to do the navigation in SCS. In other words, the marking routine; and we'll use the CMC to maneuver us into the burn attitude and set us up for the tracking. We'll burn in SCS, and there are three places through here that you can activate that relay, if you're using the normal procedures. Now we've got some detailed procedures we won't read to you now. If we get in that situation, we'll talk to you a bit. But the three times that you want to watch out for are: don't place the Spacecraft Control in CMC with the Optics Mode in Manual. I think you're probably pretty familiar with that one. Don't respond to the 204 display with Spacecraft Control in CMC. And if you make a burn, you'll probably be trimming it with G&amp;N. And wait until you've got your Verb 16, your Noun 85 display up before going back to CMC. And we can talk about it in detail, like I say, later if we need it. We've run a couple of these and they go pretty smooth.
104:00:53|T|CMP|Okay, Stu. The way I understand the scheme is that for attitude holding, while we're doing navigation, we'll do it in SCS; and when we're ready to go to work, why, we'll do CMC maneuver to the burn attitude, and we'll make the burn in SCS to avoid this relay again. Then, we don't ever want to go to CMC control with the Optics in Manual, and we don't want to respond to 204 with the CMC command. And the third one, I didn't copy.
104:01:32|C|Roo|Okay. If you do a burn in your SCS, you - depending on what you've done there, Ken, you'd probably end up with your flashing 99 display. And we want to make sure that you go on to your Noun 85 display, before you go to CMC. Then go ahead and trim the G&amp;N residuals.
104:01:57|T|CMP|Okay, Houston. Roger, I understand. We don't want to go through that transient at the end of the P40, certainly.
104:02:06|C|Roo|Righto. And that one thing, too -
104:02:08|T|CMP|If they do not respond to 204, Stu - if they don't respond to that, do you mean don't even Enter on it? Go by past it?
104:02:16|C|Roo|That's exactly what I mean. Don't Enter on it. Of course, you'll be doing the SCS burn, but don't Enter on that, or you will activate that relay - until you put the spacecraft to SCS control.
104:02:32|T|CMP|Okay; as long as it's in SCS control, though, - I can by pass no problem. the 204 with
104:02:37|C|Roo|That's affirmative, Ken. If you're in SCS control, that relay - the power is interrupted, that - the power to that relay goes through the Spacecraft Control switch, and it's got to be in CMC.
104:02:51|T|CMP|Okay.
104:02:52|C|Roo|And one other point now I'd like to clarify, Ken, is that for your tracking - see after you go to your track attitude, CMC will start you off on a rate drive, and then go to SCS Control and go to Minimum Impulse and Pitch, and just every now and then, you might have to flip it - like between PPI [?] and Midcourse 1, it just took one Minimum Impulse time and kept me right up around the 22 degrees trunnion.
104:03:24|T|CMP|Roger. Sounds like you've been working, too.
104:03:28|C|Roo|No, you've been doing all the good work there, Ken.
104:03:38|T|CMP|Doesn't sound like you guys have gotten any sleep, if you've checked out all these things, plus today's problem. Whoever put that story together today deserves a life supply of whatever he wants.
104:03:50|C|Roo|Watch what you say, Ken. You don't want to overload your pocketbook there. And, hey, I'll give you back to Hank.
104:04:01|T|CMP|Okay; thank you, Stu.
104:04:03|C|Roo|Roger.
104:04:23|C|Har|Casper, Houston. I'd like to remind you to get your RHC Direct Power Off.
104:04:32|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
104:06:02|T|CMP|Hank, seems to me I still have my Logic Power Off from early this morning. Maybe I missed where it comes back on. This is the panel 181 Logic. You got any words on where you think that ought to be?
104:06:21|C|Har|Okay; Ken. You can leave it Off for now. And after we get into SIM bay attitude, after landmark tracking, we're gonna bring up some of the SIM bay.
104:06:30|T|CMP|All righty.
104:07:15|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're Go for PDI on the CSM side
104:07:23|T|CMP|Okay.
104:11:24|C|Har|Casper, I have a mapping camera and pan camera photo pad for you, if you can squeeze it in now - between now and T1 then.
104:11:40|T|CMP|What do you show for T1? Maybe I'm out of whack.
104:11:43|C|Har|Roger. I've got about 7-1/2 minutes to go.
104:11:51|T|CMP|Okay, looks like this attitude is gonna be just about the one for T1 then, eh?
104:11:59|C|Har|Roger.
104:12:05|T|CMP|Let me hold off until I get this thing loaded, then.
104:13:19|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're showing a difference here between your actual CDUs and your final CDUs.
104:13:42|C|Har|You're looking good now, Casper.
104:14:28|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Tell me again what you just said about the CDUs.
104:14:34|C|Har|Okay, we're getting some bad data down here, so really we can't be sure. It looks like you ought to be about 28550. Is that right?
104:14:46|T|CMP|Correct.
104:14:47|C|Har|It looks good from here now, Ken.
104:14:54|T|CMP|Okay.
104:15:22|T|CMP|And, Hank, I'm gonna turn my VHF transmission on. I'll be listening to you, but I won't be answering until after they land.
104:15:32|C|Har|Roger. Copy.

104:33:09|C|Har|Stand by, Ken. I'll get an answer for you, and we're working on whether we got a stay or not on T1.
104:33:18|T|CMP|Okay; sounds like you did pretty good.
104:33:21|C|Har|They did a beautiful job.
104:33:40|C|Har|Ken, we'll went Narrow dead band on that. We got a camera pass coming.
104:34:19|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Orion is stay for T1.
104:34:27|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
104:34:43|C|Har|And, Ken, while you're maneuvering with this P20 attitude, I'd like to tell you about the Flight Plan. We want you to go - to do everything that's in the Flight Plan through doffing your PGA up to what's in your Flight Plan at 99:20. And then, we're in the process of getting you a whole new thing to operate from. And I have you a mapping camera and pan camera photo pad.
104:35:13|T|CMP|Okay. Yeah, I don't mind taking the suit off. And, okay; want to give me those pads now?
104:35:22|C|Har|Okay. Mapping camera: T-start 105:29:27; T-stop 108:2 -
104:35:36|T|CMP|Wait a minute, now. Wait a minute. Hank, I don't have any place to write these things, I don't think. I've got to go look for them. Thank you.
104:35:44|C|Har|Okay.
104:35:48|T|CMP|What's the best place to work from? The basic time line with the real GETs?
104:35:55|C|Har|I'll tell you what our overall plan, Ken, we want to get in a - the camera passes tonight. They're terminator passes - the - before we lose the opportunity, because the terminator's moving. And then we're gonna do a clock sync somewhere during the night, and scrub and get back on the Flight Plan. We're gonna scrub out about six hours of stuff.
104:36:22|T|CMP|Okay. Tell you what, I got a page here that I can work on. Why don't you give me a summary of the next couple hours, here? And I'll just write something in the Flight Plan here.
104:36:37|C|Har|Okay. Stand by. I'll see if I can get something worked out for you.
104:36:43|T|CMP|Go ahead with the camera pads. Yes, I ought to have those, they'll come up on the next rev.
104:36:56|C|Har|Casper, Houston. You're almost unreadable. I'll have to wait until we get a little better comm.
104:37:50|T|CMP|Is that better comm now?
104:37:52|C|Har|Hey, that sounds much better. We're putting together a little summary here for you.
104:38:01|T|CMP|Okay.
104:40:16|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Could you bring up the High Gain? Pitch, plus 41; Yaw, 228.
104:42:50|C|Har|Casper, Houston. I have your little rundown for the next rev, if you're ready to copy.
104:42:57|T|CMP|Okay; all set.
104:43:00|C|Har|At 105:20, MC/LA cover, open; 105:23 MC, Extend; 105:28 LA, On; 105:29 PC, Standby; Stereo, Power, Operate; T-start; MC, M is Motion; Increase, barber pole/On; MC, On; T-start; 105:50 AOS; 105:50, same time, SIM bay activation, NS deploy to 8.4 feet at 61 seconds; GR, deploy to 7.5 feet 53 seconds; that's 53 seconds. Then MS, Experiment, On; Ion source, Standby; AP - should be Alpha P/XR, Cover Open; XR On; 105:59, TC Mode Standby (P-stop), Power Off (MSFN-Q).
104:46:41|T|CMP|Okay. You ready for a readback on that, or have you got some more to fill in?
104:46:45|C|Har|Go ahead and read that back, and then I'll give you your pad.
104:46:51|T|CMP|Okay -
104:46:52|C|Har|Stand by there, Ken.
104:46:54|T|CMP|- if it will help you any, I'll be glad -
104:46:56|C|Har|Would you give us P00 and Accept? We'll up-link your state vector while you're doing that.
104:47:05|T|CMP|How about if I just give you Accept?
104:47:07|C|Har|That'll do fine.
104:47:14|T|CMP|What I was gonna suggest, if it'll help you - do whatever's easiest - I'll be glad if you want to give me the code and tell me to have it - have the SIM bay in a particular mode by a given time.
104:47:28|C|Har|Okay. That's a good idea.
104:47:29|T|CMP|Then, when we get on the front side, I'll just sort of hustle around and do whatever you suggest until we get back to a written Flight Plan. I do need about 20 minutes here somewhere to get my suit off and get the cockpit stowed. It looks like a disaster area.
104:47:51|C|Har|Okay. I concur in that. I'd like to give you the pads now if you're ready.
104:48:00|T|CMP|All set.
104:48:02|C|Har|Okay; mapping camera pad is T-start, 105:29:27; T-stop is 108:28:13. Pan camera, T-start, 105:29:27; T-stop, 105:59:27. And they just pointed out they made an error here at 105:29 in your Flight Plan. The Image Motion should come On after T-start with the mapping camera. That was a procedural error.
104:48:59|T|CMP|Roger. I understand that; no sweat.
104:49:07|C|Har|Okay, let me read back what I have. 105:20, you want the mapper door open; at 23, you want to extend it. At 28, the Laser Altimeter comes On; 29 we get Pan Camera to Standby, Stereo, and Power; to Operate at P-start, which is 05:29:27. The Mapping Camera comes On at 105:29:27. The IMC comes On, and we put it to barber pole, on the Image Motion. At 50, we'll get AOS, and we'd like to have SIM bay activation. It's my understanding you'd like for me to hold SIM bay activation until we're within AOS.
104:49:51|C|Har|That's affirmative.
104:49:52|T|CMP|Mass Spec Boom deployed to eight feet, which is T plus 01. I got your answer, thank you. Gamma Ray deployed to seven and a half feet. That's 53 seconds. The Mass Spec Experiment On, and the Ion Source is Standby. The Alpha X-Ray door comes open; the X-Ray goes On. At 59:27, the Pan Camera Mode goes to Standby, and the Power comes Off when you give me a call.
104:50:16|C|Har|That's a good readback, Ken.
104:50:21|T|CMP|Okay. I think we've got it made. We may get caught up yet.
104:50:34|C|Har|Okay. And I guess when we start bringing that on, Ken -
104:50:36|T|CMP|...
104:50:37|C|Har|- and we ought to bring the S-Band Aux TV to 5, so we can get the data.
104:50:45|T|CMP|Okay. Any harm in my doing that now so we don't forget it?
104:50:49|C|Har|Go right ahead.
104:50:53|T|CMP|Okay. You've got it. And when we get AOS next time, I'm content to - while we're reading things up, I'll be prepared to copy some things. And I'll be prepared to hop around and reconfigure whatever you need in real time.
104:51:11|C|Har|Okay. That's real good, Ken. Go ahead and get your suit off and get comfortable.
104:51:16|T|CMP|Okay. I'll - I'm just about to the point where I'll take my comm carrier off so I'll be off comm here for about ten minutes. What's LOS time?
104:51:30|C|Har|Casper, we have LOS in about 12 minutes, somewhere around 03.
104:51:30|T|CMP|Okay. I may not be back up for that, but, if not, I'll just execute this Flight Plan.
104:51:45|C|Har|Roger; Ken, and good work.
104:51:48|T|CMP|You guys did all the work today. I tell you, if we ever get a chance to look out that window, it's gonna stand you on your ears. That earthshine is as spectacular as any of the other things, which is much to my surprise.
104:52:00|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control and Orion is safely on the ground at Descartes, having landed at 104:29:36 Ground Elapsed Time. In local time that's 8:23 p.m. [The] time of landing [was] not to far away from the planned landing point. After the crew has a chance to power down the Lunar Module, do some housekeeping they will have a sleep period which will begin at about 107 hours, about two hours and ten minutes from now. With EVA 1 starting tomorrow morning out about 10:30 a.m. Central Standard Time. This is Apollo Control at 104:51.</p>
104:52:13|T|CMP|Yeah, well - I cheated a little bit there, and we didn't really have an awful lot to do while we were just spinning around. And some of those low revs came up with some very interesting observations. In particular, the one that strikes me most vividly is the fact that - if you remember all of those apparent lineations we saw in Silver Spur in the places around Hadley in the pictures. Those same kind of things appear all over the surface of the Moon down now. It's just everywhere I look in the area where there's any topographical relief. They go in all different directions. I haven't been able to sort out if there's some preferred direction or some reason for it. What - what I did happen to notice as I came across Theophilus on one of those passes was that you see this in the walls of Theophilus - that's on the interior - and in the places where there are craters around the outside or some kind of - looks like some fracture or something of that nature that goes across Theophilus or into it. You see what looks like a reflection in that these patterns - if you had a crater on the rim - these patterns would sorta show up like you would expect from a shock pattern. They would be radial and concentric to that crater. And these little lines seem to take that kind of a twist and then the fact that some of them go along with topographic highs. I'll see if I can get some photos. I didn't take any photos on this stuff because I didn't have a chance, but I looked out and saw some of these things, and they're just everywhere.
104:53:50|C|Har|That sounds like a real interesting observation there, Ken.
104:53:58|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to get my suit off, and if I don't catch you at LOS, I'll see you at AOS.
104:54:02|C|Har|Okay.
104:54:18|C|Har|The computer is yours, Ken.
|P|PAO|We've had loss of signal from the Command Module, Casper, as it went behind the Moon. During that front-side pass, the Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly was passed some flight plan updates for the Orbital Science Phase on the Mission. Orion, meanwhile, at Descartes landing site, is going through the post-landing checklist, all the power-down procedures to conserve electrical power, and we're still up and live at 105:06.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> We've had loss of signal from the Command Module, Casper, as it went behind the Moon.

105:53:13|T|CMP|Hello, Houston. Casper.
105:53:18|C|Har|Casper, Houston. How do you read?
105:53:22|T|CMP|Loud and clear.
105:53:40|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We need barber pole plus three on the camera.
105:53:44|T|CMP|Henry, I'm gonna - Okay, barber pole plus three.
105:53:58|T|CMP|You have it. And would you remind me when you get about 30 seconds from Pan Camera to Stop.
105:52:05|C|Har|Will do.
105:54:10|T|CMP|Okay.
101:54:20|T|CMP|I want to mark something on my chart, and then I'll talk to you for just a minute.
101:54:25|C|Har|Roger.
101:54:53|T|CMP|Okay. And I put Battery A on Charge at 105:35.
101:55:04|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
101:55:31|T|CMP|I've got you out the window now; but it looks like half of you have gone away. It's all black.
101:55:42|C|Har|I hope we're in the sunny half.
101:55:48|T|CMP|Oh, I bet you're in the dark half. Aren't you? That shows how long it's been since you've been outside.
101:55:56|C|Har|It has been awhile.
101:56:09|T|CMP|As I came over, I finally got squared away; and as came across King, I had the binoculars out. And, sure enough, on the central peaks down there - the things we've been debating for so long about whether they were streaks or outcrops or what they were - are large blocks, which are on the - the central peaks. Most of the blocks seem to lie on the eastern side of the peaks; however, there are a few blocks on the western side - enough that you can tell that the reason they look dark is they cast pretty long shadows because they're pretty huge blocks. The floor looks like it's - looks like an old mud flow. It's really a strange looking floor. It's got lots of flow bands and patterns in it. In the crater rim to the west, on the interior shows at least three distinct shades of this gray. The upper one is the same color as the surface, which is a light - sort of a darker gray. Then there's a light gray band, which runs parallel to it. And then the dark band again below that. And the light band is, perhaps, a quarter of the depth of the crater wall. To the north and west of King, I ran into some things that looked like the same sort of swirls we've been looking at up around Al-Birumi and around Reiner Gamma. These two are in the highlands. And with the binoculars, it's my impression that these probably have a certain amount of relief - topographic relief - with them. But they look - when you look straight down on them, they look exactly like the other things we've been looking at. And I took a quick picture of that thing, and I put it on magazine Victor. And if you'll keep a record of these things, Ed[?], that one is on Victor at exposure - oh, excuse me, it's magazine November November; and that's exposure 41.
105:58:23|C|Har|We got that, Ken. And, Casper, could we get High Gain, Auto?
105:58:37|T|CMP|You've got Auto, now.
105:58:46|T|CMP|And it's oscillating. Suppose I go back to - there it is. Okay. I had a little tone in my headset that was beeping very softly, and the signal strength was doing the same thing.
105:59:09|C|Har|Roger. You want to go Block on the computer, Ken. And we show your Optics still in Manual. And, Ken, you're about ten seconds from Pan Camera, Off.
105:59:23|T|CMP|Okay. The computer's in Block. Okay.
105:59:30|C|Har|I was a little late with that one.
105:59:35|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. No sweat. We got it done. I'll check the Optics. And when you're ready, I'll start configuring the SIM bay.
106:00:03|T|CMP|And, Hank, would you verify that it's okay to take the Optics and put them to CMC - or to zero them. I sure don't want to take any chances with it.
106:00:18|C|Har|Okay. It's okay. They say nothing will happen.
106:00:31|C|Har|And, Ken, we've got a little trouble with the High Gain. We need to go back to Reacq.
106:00:42|T|CMP|Okay. I'm in Reacq. Want to go back to Auto now?
106:00:47|C|Har|Stand by. Okay. Cleared to go to Auto.
106:01:06|T|CMP|Okay. Auto it is. You got a good one that time. And if you're ready, I'm ready to start deploying things here.
106:01:16|C|Har|Okay, Ken. Would you stand by? We're waiting for OSO to get his data.
106:01:24|T|CMP|Oh, very well.
106:01:39|T|CMP|Dum-de-dum (singing).
106:03:11|C|Har|Ken, while we're waiting here, how did your extend time go on the mapping camera?
106:03:14|T|CMP|I didn't time it that time, Hank. I - sorry.
106:03:22|C|Har|Okay.
106:03:27|C|Har|Casper. Pan Camera Power, Off.
106:03:34|T|CMP|Okay. Pan Camera Power is Off.
106:03:36|T|CMP|Mark it.
106:03:44|C|Har|OSO has his data now. We can proceed with boom deployment.
106:03:55|T|CMP|Okay. We button this up. Okay, the first one you'd like is a - how about a mass spec for 61 seconds?
106:04:13|C|Har|That's affirmative.
106:04:17|T|CMP|Okay. Going to Deploy -
106:04:20|T|CMP|Mark.
106:05:22|T|CMP|Deploy is Off this time.
106:05:25|C|Har|Roger. You're clear to start the gamma ray out.
106:05:40|T|CMP|Gamma ray is going out.
106:06:34|T|CMP|Gamma ray is stopped.
106:06:39|C|Har|Okay, Ken. And could you give us barber pole plus 4 on the Map Camera.
106:06:45|T|CMP|Okay. That should be one more step. Right?
106:06:48|C|Har|That's affirmative.
106:06:52|T|CMP|All right. You've got it. Okay, now the Mass Spec experiment is going to On. The Ion Source is going to Standby.
106:07:25|T|CMP|Alpha Particle and X-Ray Door is coming Open -
106:07:28|T|CMP|Mark. And it's good.
106:07:58|T|CMP|And the X-Ray is coming to On -
106:08:02|T|CMP|Mark.
106:08:30|C|Har|... somebody looks real good right now a - like to read you up a TEI-26 pad block data.
106:08:42|T|CMP|Okay. Would you stand by just a second while I get some food going here?
106:08:46|C|Har|Okay.
106:09:43|C|Har|Ken, for your information we're planning on your retirement - to rest that is, at 109:30, the nominal time.
106:09:52|T|CMP|I'm glad you clarified that.
106:10:02|T|CMP|I hope you realize I'm too young to retire.
106:10:05|C|Har|Roger.
106:10:14|T|CMP|Can you tell me anything about the status of the surface guys? Are they gonna get at least two EVAs out of this?
106:10:28|C|Har|I think the plan is now, Ken, for two EVA's. They are busy buttoning up the LM now and getting ready to get some sleep. They're gonna move the EVA times - at least the first one's gonna be tomorrow morning about 10:30 Central, I think.
106:10:46|T|CMP|Okay.
106:10:48|C|Har|And we're gonna change our shifts around too, so I'll be on again in the morning, and then Stu'll get it in the afternoon.
106:11:00|T|CMP|Okay. All right, now I got something soaking here. I'll be ready to copy. Okay. Go ahead.
106:11:15|C|Har|All rightee. TEI-26, SPS/G&amp;N; 38726; plus 0.72, plus 1.33; 125:14:27.47; plus 3170.3, plus 1101.6, minus 0310.1; 181, 089, 021; rest of the pad, NA. The set stars are the same as on your circ pad; same attitude; ullage, two jets, 17 seconds; other, Lamda of the Moon at T<sub>ig</sub>, minus 179.02. End of pad.
106:12:40|T|CMP|Okay. That's a TEI-26, SPS/G&amp;N; 38726; plus 0.72 plus 1.33; 125:14:27.47; plus 3170.3, plus 1101.6, minus 0310.1; 181, 089, and 021; Sirius and Rigel were the angles off the circ pad; two jets, 17 seconds; Lambda 179.02, and that's a minus.
106:13:09|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
106:13:31|C|Har|Okay, Ken; we're gonna leave you alone and let you eat now. We've still got about 49 minutes to LOS. And at your convenience, sometime a little later, we'd like to get the crew status report from this morning, which was omitted.
106:13:47|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. That's gonna take some bookkeeping; I'll work on that. Sure would rather look out the window, Hank.
106:13:59|C|Har|Did anybody ever give you some words on the undervolt last night?
106:14:07|T|CMP|Yes. The words we got were that I inadvertently attempted to get the pan camera on the same time the heaters all came on and - I guess the transient was just - just too much.
106:14:22|C|Har|Roger. That's - that's the story as I get it.
106:14:23|T|CMP|Is that the way you understand it?
106:14:25|C|Har|Right. That's affirmative.
106:14:30|T|CMP|Okay, well - I'm sorry we missed those photos, but it - it sure seamed like the prudent thing to do at the time.
106:14:41|C|Har|We concur.
106:17:53|T|CMP|Henry, another thing that turns out to be a - a pretty nice little gadget is these nets that are in the stowage compartments. Particularly when you get in the food locker when it's about half full. Things are able to stay under some semblance of control. And that's a mighty nice thing.
106:18:22|C|Har|So those are working out real good, huh?
106:18:26|T|CMP|Yes, it sure is. That's been a very - help.
106:18:42|C|Har|And, Ken you don't have to acknowledge. Look our plans are in the morning first thing to give you a clock sync and get back into the Flight Plan.
106:19:42|T|CMP|That sounds like a good plan.
106:21:09|T|CMP|Oh, one thing you've got to be careful of up here is - when you go to look outside, you kind of have to watch it because you get your - you get too greedy and you get your nose up against the window. About one breath is all it takes, and it's all fogged over.
106:21:25|C|Har|Roger. I understand.
106:21:27|T|CMP|I think our humidity must be running fairly high.
106:21:37|T|CMP|I'm passing over a nice little guy right now and would guess - on, I haven't been paying any attention to where I am - looks like I must be - probably looking the the north at - somewhere around the - Guts - Gutenberg uplands. And I'm passing over a little crater that's got another large fill in the center and nice big crater in top of him, a little crater chain around it. And as I said earliest, everything out here has this linear pattern or these lineaments and it doesn't matter whether it's a flat surface, a horizontal, vertical, inside of a wall of a crater - they all seem to have it in one form or another.
106:22:35|C|Har|Okay, Ken. if - if our plot board up here is right, you ought to be in - coming up on landing site.
106:22:48|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see.
106:23:03|T|CMP|Oh, maybe I'm out the wrong window here.
106:23:34|T|CMP|You're right, Henry.
106:24:28|T|CMP|And, if you'll remember that little black dot that we drew on our map and talked about. There's a little black spot about in the right area, and I don't have my map so I just looked out at it. But I'll come back next time and take a look and - sure like it is something - entirely different texture.
106:24:48|C|Har|Are you talking about right in the area of the landing site?
106:24:53|T|CMP|In the - in the landing site area, but not in the landing site - traverse regions. But that little dark thing looked like a - a possible cone that was out to the - north and to the west. There's a little black dot out there that looks like there may be something that's - that is distinctive. And next time I come over, I'll be better prepared to look for it.
106:25:19|C|Har|Okay. I remember that one, that was in the edge of the plotter, wasn't it?
106:25:26|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
106:26:56|T|CMP|I tell you, it sure is impressive how much - how much the scenery changes as the Sun angle changes and how rapidly that goes down.
106:27:43|T|CMP|Your plot boards show me over Albategnius, you say?
106:27:46|C|Har|Say again.
106:27:50|T|CMP|Does the plot board show me over Albategnius?
106:27:54|C|Har|That's affirmative.
106:27:59|T|CMP|Okay. Now let me tell you a little something here. Just to the north and mostly to the west of Albategnius, the ground - and I think in the higher Sun it's going to look like - look a lot like Imbrium sculpture but not here. It has the mottled effect and the same appearance that the Descartes area had at the same Sun angle yesterday. And that's almost directly south of - it's a little south and a little bit to - of Ptolemaeus, and it's a little bit to the east of Alphonsus.
106:28:49|C|Har|Roger. You ought to be coming up on a terminator now. Is that right? Pretty close to it?
106:28:58|T|CMP|Yes, sir. My view is disappearing rapidly.
106:30:03|C|Har|You should be over Ptolemaeus now.
106:30:43|C|Har|Casper, for your information, everything in the SIM bay is looking good now.
106:30:55|T|CMP|Okay. I just saw something that - I really don't know what to make - I'm in the - I think the spacecraft is just about in the dark, but not quite. We've passed the ground terminator, and I'm looking out of window number 3 down towards the ground. I'm trying to get a preview of what's coming in earthshine. And there's a bright flash that's going along out there. At first, I thought there was something that was on the deck, but it's apparently a piece of debris that's in orbit with us. It's sitting there, tumbling over and flashing.
106:31:43|C|Har|It's traveling along with you.
106:31:46|T|CMP|It moves across the ground, so it must be a piece of debris. Yeah.
106:32:15|T|CMP|As a matter of fact, I look around now and there's quite a few of those.
106:32:21|C|Har|Can you get any idea how far away they are -
106:32:48|T|CMP|- Depends on what effect that has on - no I can't, Hank. It's just a piece of something that's out there, and it's tumbling so that it gives you an occulting reflection. No field [feel?] at all for it, but it's moving in approximately the same velocity that we are.
106:33:02|C|Har|Ken, in reference to your observations of Crater King, we got some ideas about those swirls that are northwest of King. And we'd like for you to get a comparison of those with the swirls of Ibn Yunus. And I wonder if those also have topographic expression?
106:33:27|T|CMP|Okay. I'm too - I'll have to do that some other time, because today I'm too far south to see those things up by Ibn Yunus. I can just barely see up to Neper.
106:33:39|C|Har|Roger.
106:33:43|T|CMP|But we sure need to keep that in mind.
106:33:46|C|Har|And another thing you might be thinking about if you get an opportunity on some round is to get us a description of the area north of Crater King, including the Soviet Mountains.
106:33:58|T|CMP|Yeah. I was thinking of looking at that. I really hadn't planned to spend much time on King this time. I was going to just kind of look at the - look at the ole crater there. But, got so interested in it that - it looked like there's another crater that's just to the east of King that has, say, a little bisected, central feature just like King. You know the thing that makes that - that little Y-shape. And it looks the same way. That's kind of - kind of interesting, I thought.
106:34:44|C|Har|Yeah. I guess we hadn't seen that in the photos.
106:41:58|T|CMP|I guess, Hank, I ought to be passing Flamsteed now.
106:42:05|C|Har|Roger. That looks right.
106:42:12|T|CMP|It's really impressive how much you can see in the dark.
106:42:27|T|CMP|I don't believe you can see as much now as you could last night. Of course, partly we're - I'm higher now than I was when I looked at it last night. And the Earth is noticeably smaller, so I guess it's getting - it's losing it's reflective ability rather rapidly.
106:42:52|C|Har|Roger.
106:42:55|T|CMP|I was also very impressed with the way you could see the - the LM outline in earthshine. That was something I had not anticipated. Last night as we came across - well let me see what it was - it starts with an H - over on the western rim. Hevetius. Yeah. We drove across that last night, and you could really see the floor patterns in that beautifully.
106:44:49|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Let's see. I owe you a crew status report from this morning. Right?
106:44:56|C|Har|Roger.
106:45:00|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see if I can give you that thing now.
106:45:30|T|CMP|Okay. Alfa 1, 22047; Alfa 3, 6; Alfa 4, negative. Bravo 1, 15044; Bravo 3, 6; Bravo 4, negative. Charlie 1, 21095; Charlie 3, 7; Charlie 4, 1 Seconal.
106:46:24|C|Har|We copy, Ken.
106:46:28|T|CMP|Okay. Now I'm going to try to go down the menus here. We're looking for Day 4. Is that correct?
106:46:42|C|Har|Affirmative.
106:46:48|T|CMP|Okay. On commander, Meal A, you can delete the mixed fruit, and meal B, you can delete pea soup; Meal C, delete chicken stew and add a chocolate pudding. For me, you can take Meal A and delete the mixed-fruit. You can delete the bread and Jelly. On Bravo, you can delete the pea soup, meatballs. On Charlie, you can delete the chicken stew, and I guess that takes care of those things. The reason for so many of these - we all deleted these canned things, because we got them all over the spacecraft last time, and we decided that we really couldn't afford to do that again.
106:48:13|C|Har|Roger. We copy.
106:48:18|T|CMP|Okay. And let me find Charlie's here.
106:49:02|T|CMP|Okay. Here's Charlie's. And on Meal A, you can delete mixed fruit and jelly. Meal B, you can delete sugar cookies. Meal C, you can delete the pudding and the chocolate bar.
106:49:26|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
106:51:01|T|CMP|Now we're coming across Hevelius again, and I can see Grimaldi and a couple of fractures that go across its rim. You can really see a lot of detail here. You can see the rilles, you can see - as everybody pointed out, the - they look like ribbons that are just dropped down, and they go all the way across the crater like Hevelius. And it looks like they go out from ..., and they come down - in fact, they go all the way down to Grimaldi. And just before they get to Grimaldi, they run into a crater. And it looks like they might have been filled a little bit. In fact, it looks the same way that some of the rilles that dot the Fra Mauro, look like they've been filled in. Then there is a very smooth patch that's lined up with this graben that runs from there to Grimaldi. No, I'm sorry. I'm calling Riccioli, Grimaldi. The crater I'm talking about now is Riccioli, and it's got quite a few fractures that run out. And it looks like a flow pattern. It looks just like looking down on a - on a long tongue of lava like we've seen terrestrially. I don't mean to infer that there is lava, but I'm just saying that it has the same appearance. It is coming out of the northeastern corner of Riccioli. And it has what looks like little ripple patterns on it, like you'd expect for flow bands, but they aren't quite as arcuate, and they don't take quite the same - the same concentric pattern that you'd expect from a flow front. But this little crater coming down from Hevelius - the rille it comes down to there and then it hits the crater, and then it gets a very, very smooth spot. And then it runs in and you can see continuations of these lineaments right on across Riccioli.
106:53:07|C|Har|Roger. That sounds real interesting.
106:53:11|T|CMP|Riccioli has quite a few elongate little craters around it. Several of them that are - elongate - and one of them is quite long. I'd say it's maybe - it's curved and looks like it's maybe ten kilometers long. And it has just a slight arc to it. But, it is a very elongate feature. Now, we are moving into material that's very hilly and I don't see a lot of small craters. I don't see a lot of bright ones. You can see bright rims in here quite well. The things that do stand out to the west of Riccoli are the very dramatic cross cutting graben-type rilles. They cross, in one place here, almost 90 degrees to each other. Looks like I am looking at a very subdued old basin. And, these things go across the hills and right on across the basin floor. And, I'm not sure, but I would guess that some of these things - other lineaments I am seeing - they're running toward the northeast or more than likely things coming out of Orientale. I should be coming in towards the outer rim of the Orientale Basin. You get-the same kind of impression of - at the terminator when the earthshine runs out as you do when sunshine runs out. The only thing it's different is you don't - you don't get to see quite as much of the - everything is a lot more subdued. And, you don't get shadows that are nearly as long. Or, at least not as bright. There's also, running down here - there is one ridge and I am sure I am looking in a ridge instead of a graben. I've got grabens and cut it. But this thing has a bright line on it that looks like ridge that runs northeast, southwest along with some of the graben. And, it seems it's one of the first big ridges I've seen that cuts up over a highlands clump of material. That's all just to the - just to the west of Riccioli.
106:55:29|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
106:55:35|C|Har|Ken, we have -
106:55:36|T|CMP|Okay, Houston, we are getting ready to -
106:55:42|C|Har|Ken, we've got your Flight Plan here -
106:55:43|T|CMP|Go ahead, we're ready for LOS, so -
106:55:47|T|CMP|Okay. Do you have time to read it to me?
106:55:50|C|Har|I think so; if you are ready to copy.
106:55:56|T|CMP|All right. Can you tell me where I should start?
106:56:00|C|Har|Okay. LOS will be at 107:02. Approx -
106:56:07|T|CMP|Okay. Should I be in the Flight Plan or should I be writing in something separate?
106:56:11|C|Har|I think you better write in something separate.
106:56:17|T|CMP|Okay, stand by. Okay, shoot.
106:56:20|C|Har|Okay. 107:02 LOS. And approximately 107:10 - approximately eight minutes after LOS, configure DSE - stop High Bit Rate, Command Reset, Forward. 107:21, sunrise. 107:25, O<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Auto. O<sub>2</sub> Heaters, three, Off. 107:38, Image Motion, Increase. Barber pole, plus 3. 107:48, AOS. 107:57, Pan Camera, Standby - Stereo, Power. 107:58, 13 - This is your T-start. Pan Camera, Operate. Mass Spectrometer, Ion Source, On. At the same time - right after you get the Pan Camera. 108:04, Motion, Increase, barber pole, plus 4. T-stop. 108:28:13 - that's also T-stop for the mapping camera, which read up - I read that up to you earlier. It's Pan Camera, Standby at T-stop. Pan Camera, Off MSFN cue. Mapping Camera, Off (T-stop). Wait 30 seconds. Mapping Camera, Standby. Image Motion, Off. Laser Altimeter, Off. Mapping Camera, Retract. Mapping Camera Laser Altimeter Cover, Closed. 108:40, Mass Spec, Deploy. Gamma Ray, Deploy. 108:50, return to the Flight Plan, at last. And pick up with the P20 and follow on with those activities through your pre-sleep checklist and - I've already - the only thing different there is I've already given you PDI-26 PAD.
107:00:21|T|CMP|Outstanding. You guys really do good work. Okay, I think I've got everything here. I didn't have any questions about it. You want me - How much time do we have? I don't know whether it's worth trying to read back or not?
107:00:36|C|Har|Okay, we've got 2 minutes to LOS. You don't have to read back. I think -
107:00:42|T|CMP|Okay, here goes. 107:02, LOS. 107:10, configure DSE - stop High Bit Rate, Command Reset, Forward. 21 is sunrise; 25, O<sub>2</sub> heaters, 1 and 2 to Auto. O<sub>2</sub> Heaters Tank 3, Off. 38, IMC, Increase; barber pole, plus 3. 48, AOS; 57, Pan, Standby - Stereo and Power. 58, 13 - Pan Camera to Operate; Mass Spec Ion Source, On. 04, that's 108:04, IMC to barberpole, plus 4. 28, 13, T-stop for Pan Camera to Standby and Mapping Camera to Off. Thirty seconds, then to Standby, IMC, Off. Laser Altimeter, Off; Mapping Camera, Retract. Mapping Camera Cover, Closed. At 108:40, Mass Spec to Gamma Ray to Deploy. 108:50, return to the Flight Plan.
107:01:32|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
107:01:37|T|CMP|Okay. Outstanding.
107:01:42|C|Har|Okay, we got less than a minute to go. Stu will see you on the other side.
107:01:59|T|CMP|All right, Hank. Thank you very much. You've done a good day's work. See you tomorrow evening.
107:02:05|C|Har|Roger.
107:52:32|T|CMP|Houston, are you there?
107:52:34|C|Roo|Roger, Casper. Houston standing by.
107:52:39|T|CMP|Well, hello there.
107:52:45|C|Roo|And, Casper. We'd like you to have - go back to Reacq on the high gain, please.
107:52:53|T|CMP|Okay. Every time I try that it looks like it does worse. Well, it's holding in there this time, I guess.
107:53:33|C|Roo|And, Ken. Sometime, at your convenience, we'd like to have you push on your biomed sensors. Getting a little noise on the data. Just like to see something cleared up.
107:53:51|T|CMP|Okay. I'll get to that in just a minute. I'm flapping right now with some - trying to make up the things we missed here. And I just finished putting most of Sharonov and Mendeleev on magazine November November. And I'll try to pick up the one that ... if you'll tell me I can do it on November November.
107:54:20|C|Roo|Okay, stand by.
107:55:33|C|Roo|And, Casper. Could you give us a frame number on November November.
107:55:41|T|CMP|Okay. How about - ah - 145?
107:55:49|C|Roo|Okay, 145. I believe that.
107:56:10|T|CMP|And, don't let me forget things like this pan camera thing coming up, because I am sitting here getting camera set up. I am going to try to get the earthshine sequence in this trip, too.
107:56:23|C|Roo|Okay. Roger. We'll give you a call.
107:56:43|C|Roo|And, Ken, it's about time now. Within the next 15 seconds or so, if you want to get the Pan Camera, Standby Stereo on Power.
107:56:54|T|CMP|Okay, thank you, sir. Standby, Stereo, Power. You've got it.
107:57:00|C|Roo|Roger.
107:57:06|T|CMP|Well, I'll tell you. Just a little reminder like that can go a long ways toward getting something done in here.
107:57:13|C|Roo|Jolly good. We'll try to please.
107:57:13|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 107 hours and 59 minutes, and at this point, we have caught up with all of the back-log of tapes that was accumulated during the change-of-shift press briefing and which continued to pile up on us as we were replaying the tapes that we had already accumulated. We are up to date now and standing by live, and we believe that third good night, or at least hope that third good night, was the final one. We don't expect to hear from the crew now for about eight hours aboard Orion. We are in contact with Ken Mattingly aboard the orbiting Command Module - Command Service Module, Casper; and we'll be picking that up and standing by until Ken Mattingly completes this revolution and goes behind the Moon, and we expect he also before much longer will be getting a rest period. Based on the data received from the Lunar Module Guidance &amp; Navigation System during the landing, we have come up with a set of landing coordinates which agree very closely with the estimation that John Young gave of the Spacecraft's position. Our coordinates from the calculations here on the ground show the Lunar Module Orion to be located about 430 feet [130 metres] west and about 900 feet [270 metres] north of the planned target point. If I remember correctly, Young estimated that they had come down about 200 meters west and about 100 meters north of a crater very near the landing site, and that crater was Double Spot Crater, which is just slightly to the south and west of the LM site. So the two numbers would be very comparable. The numbers that I gave, the 430 feet west and 900 feet north are with respect of the landing site - the numbers that Young used. His estimate was 200 feet - or 200 meters, rather- west of Double Spot Crater and 100 meters north, which is about the same location, as best we can tell, as that we have computed. The coordinates of this landing point would be 8 degrees, 59 minutes and 13.2 seconds south and 15 degrees, 30 minutes 48.6 seconds east. We do expect that these coordinates will be updated, particularly if Ken Mattingly is able to get some tracking data from orbit. Using the CSM sextant, he plans to try to take some landmark sightings on the landing site and will also get an additional fix based on crew observations once they get out and get a chance to look in a little more detail at the surrounding landscape. At this point, we'll switch over to our second air-to-ground line and stand by for any conversation with Ken Mattingly aboard the orbiting Command Module, Casper.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 107 hours and 59 minutes, and at this point, we have caught up with all of the back-log of tapes that was accumulated during the change-of-shift press briefing and which continued to pile up on us as we were replaying the tapes that we had already accumulated.

107:57:56|T|CMP|Okay.
107:58:05|C|Roo|Ten seconds, Ken.
107:58:15|T|CMP|And, you've got it.
107:58:17|C|Roo|Okay. Roger -
107:58:19|T|CMP|Barber pole in gray and away she goes.
107:58:20|C|Roo|Very good and Ion Source, On.
107:58:27|T|CMP|Ion Source, On.
107:58:28|T|CMP|Mark.
107:58:32|C|Roo|Okay. And, Ken, on those last November November, we'll give you 30 frames on that one.
107:58:45|T|CMP|Okay. I guess it was scheduled for another magazine, but I just don't have time to change it.
107:59:00|C|Roo|No Sweat. You got 30.
107:59:02|T|CMP|Okay. That should be plenty. And, I got the magazine XX loaded in the Hycon, and I am ready to go to work on that as soon as we get in the darkness. Well, maybe that won't work, because I guess you got a P52 and things coming for me.
107:59:16|C|Roo|Stand by on that, Ken.
107:59:30|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, what we'd like for you to do after this Sunside pass, after you finish up here, is to get a good night's sleep. We're not showing you anything scheduled after that.
107:59:46|T|CMP|Okay, I thought there was a P52 or something I was supposed to get as soon as it got dark. I'll - I can sneak that in there, too. I hate to see us miss very much of the things that we almost did.
108:00:00|C|Roo|No, Ken. This - It's not scheduled. The last thing you need to -
108:00:02|T|CMP|Well ...
108:00:03|C|Roo|- do is 108 plus 50, where you go in to do the activities there in the flight plan; you go right into the pre-sleep checklist and we'll see you in the morning.
108:00:18|T|CMP|Oh, okay. Outstanding. Very good. Thank you.
108:00:22|C|Roo|Roger.
108:02:09|C|Roo|Okay, Casper, if we can have the High Gain to Auto; please, sir.
108:02:16|T|CMP|You've got it.
108:02:21|C|Roo|Okay.
108:02:35|T|CMP|Can you look in your plot-board me approximately what my longitude is right now?
108:02:45|C|Roo|Oh, Ken, it's probably about 70 East, something like that. You're just coming across the western rim of Smythii there.
108:03:03|T|CMP|Okay, good enough.
108:03:44|T|CMP|Yes, here comes our old friend, Langrenus.
108:04:03|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, we need barber pole ... -
108:04:03|T|CMP|I guess you need a little barber pole, don't you? Okay, that should be one plus what we have.
108:06:24|T|CMP|Hey, Stu, if I put 30 frames on this Crozier, I won't get that first strip of Kant - Andel. You think about doing away with the intervalometer and taking the pictures with less overlap and try to squeeze it all onto this one mag?
108:06:46|C|Roo|Okay, stand by. Let's take a look at that, Ken.
108:06:51|T|CMP|Okay, I got a couple of minutes before I start.
108:06:55|C|Roo|Okay.
108:07:29|T|CMP|Oh.
108:08:07|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, you can go ahead and disregard the intervalometer and try to get them both on that same mag.
108:08:17|T|CMP|Okay, thank you very much. I'm all set up to come up on Crozier.
108:08:23|C|Roo|Okay.
108:15:41|T|CMP|Well, it looks like I ran out anyhow. I got 165 and the magazine's empty, and I just finished the strip of Crozier.
108:15:54|C|Roo|Okay, I copy that.
108:16:21|T|CMP|That's on magazine November November.
108:16:26|C|Roo|Okay.
108:16:30|T|CMP|And I'll go see if I can get Papa Papa out here real fast.
108:17:16|T|CMP|Okay, Papa Papa is out and loaded. I'll try to pick up Descartes to Andel with it.
108:17:24|C|Roo|Roger.
108:22:07|T|CMP|Stu, there is a definite textural similarity between the material or the bright spot by Descartes Crater and the things around Stone Mountain. However, it is a lighter albedo. It's a shade lighter and the line of demarcation seems to come along the long crater.
108:22:38|C|Roo|Okay. We got that.
108:22:38|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 108 hours, 21 minutes. We have heard no nothing further from the crew aboard the Lunar Module Orion, Charlie Duke and John Young since we last said good night. But we do have about 40 minutes of acquisition time left with the Command Module, Casper, which is presently in an orbit 66.8 nautical miles [124 kilometres] by 53 nautical miles [98 kilometres]. And occasionally we are getting bits and pieces drifting through the communications of what sounds like Marshall music that Ken Mattingly is playing on the onboard tape recorder. And as the level reaches the high enough point that is triggering his vox, the voice operated relay and the communication system and we'll get a snatch of it here and there. Mattingly at the present time is getting caught up on his normal flight plans and we expect he will be caught up by about 109 hours, 30 minutes at which time he's scheduled to begin an eight and half hour rest period. At present time he's involved in keeping the SIM bay operating and taking a series of photographs. And at about 109 hours, 17 minutes he is scheduled to start in on the pre-sleep checklist. We'll continue to stand by live for conversation between Ken Mattingly and CapCom, Stu Roosa.

108:23:48|T|CMP|And another strange sight over here, I think it's Andel, that's where I'm supposed to be ending the strip. But there's another crater here that looks like it's flooded, except this same flooded material seems to run up on the outside. You can see a definite patch of this stuff that's run down inside an old crater. And that material at least lays on top of it, but it lays on top of things that are outside and higher. It's a very strange operation. I guess we'll have to wait and let someone that knows what they're talking about look at the pictures.
108:24:25|C|Roo|All righty, Ken. Sounds real interesting.
108:24:31|T|CMP|Man, this is unbelievable. It's really something. Everywhere you turn, there's something new. And let's see if we can get in the old SS on Ptolemaeus here.
108:26:13|T|CMP|Well, I'll tell you what. I'm going to have to skip Ptolemaeus. The terminator is still on the rim.
108:26:22|C|Roo|Okay.
108:26:23|T|CMP|Just for kicks, though, I'm going to show you one on frame SS that is really fascinating. And I'm just on the eastern rim of Ptolemaeus. I mentioned it last time. I'm going to take a little strip of these.
108:26:44|T|CMP|And then see if I can get - yeah, that ought to be good enough. Okay, I took - I took it up to 20 frames, and I used about five of these on SS. And what I took it of was - This material that's on the eastern rim of Ptolemaeus has the same textural appearance in the - low that we saw in the Descartes formation, that being the stuff coming from the crater Descartes running north yesterday. An entirely different appearance than the rest of the terrain in the low Sun. I think there may be some interesting comparison there.
108:27:32|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. Got that. And you're approaching 30 seconds to - the -
108:27:42|T|CMP|Okay, going to end up pan camera off here somewhere.
108:27:45|C|Roo|Roger; on my mark, you'll be 25 seconds.
108:27:49|C|Roo|Mark. And, Ken, just turn the cameras off there. Then, before you continue on with those steps, I want to say something about those procedures on down at the bottom. I'm showing 6 - 7 seconds.
108:28:08|T|CMP|Okay.
108:28:14|C|Roo|And -
108:28:15|C|Roo|Mark. I show T-stop. That's the pan camera and mapping camera.
108:28:18|T|CMP|Okay, they are Standby and Off. I'll wait 30 seconds before I take the Image Motion, Off. Hey, thank you, Stu, that was a big help.
108:28:30|C|Roo|Roger. And - I would - We're going to delete, on those procedures there, the Mapping Camera, Retract; and the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Close -We're going to leave those out all night, and we'll have a - a plan tomorrow on how we're going to handle the mapping camera.
108:28:51|T|CMP|Okay. You do want the Laser, Off, though. Is that correct?
108:28:55|C|Roo|That's affirmative.
108:29:02|T|CMP|Okay, the Laser is Off now. The Mapping Camera going to Standby and the Image Motion is coming Off.
108:29:08|C|Roo|Jolly good.
108:29:18|C|Roo|And, Ken, a couple of other items. We're going to let the Bat A charge all night, so we'll just leave that as is.
108:29:30|T|CMP|Okay. Those batteries kinda put in a day's work, too, today.
108:29:36|C|Roo|Roger.
108:30:03|T|CMP|Okay, I see that we're going to have AOS on the next pass before we get - before the sleep period starts, so I think I'll wait and give you my film summary at AOS, if that's okay. It'll take me that long to sort it all out, I'm afraid.
108:30:23|C|Roo|That's okay, Ken.
108:30:29|T|CMP|All I was planning to give you was how much was left in each mag.
108:30:35|C|Roo|Say again, Ken.
108:30:39|T|CMP|All I was planning to give you, Stu was, how much is left in each magazine.
108:30:43|C|Roo|Hey, that's jolly.
108:32:28|C|Roo|And Casper, Houston.
108:32:31|T|CMP|Okay.
108:32:33|C|Roo|Okay I got a couple of things.
108:32:35|T|CMP|Go ahead.
108:32:36|C|Roo|Ken, one is we would like to delete that film status report. We would like for you to start your rest period just as soon as you can after LOS and let us pick up any talking about the film or anything like that for tomorrow.
108:32:54|T|CMP|Oh, very well. You is the boss.
108:33:00|C|Roo|And another thing, we're noticing indications here that your screens - on your O<sub>2</sub> return hoses and also the suit circuit return valve. You might take a look at those tonight and see if they need a little cleaning.
108:33:18|T|CMP|Okay, I've been cleaning the suit circuit return screen every night and it's been getting pretty dirty, so I'll check it again today and the other hoses, I've got a - since I didn't have a screen for the inlets, I capped the inlets and just used the outlets to keep stuff from - We got so much junk here, I didn't want to get stuff inside the hoses down through the suit fans and to clog up the other filters -
108:33:43|C|Roo|Okay.
108:33:44|T|CMP|- So I put the interconnects on the inlets and just let the air blow out of the hoses and take it all in through the suit circuit return. That might give you a little higher pressure rise.
108:33:57|C|Roo|Okay, we - we concur with the configuration and but we have noticed the O<sub>2</sub> flow creeping up slowly, indicating that it would probably need a little housecleaning on that screen.
108:34:10|T|CMP|Yes, sir; thank you very much. I'll catch that baby.
108:34:13|C|Roo|Okay.
108:34:15|T|CMP|I'll tell you, this is - A man shouldn't get paid for doing this.
108:34:20|C|Roo|Yes, it really sounds great, Ken. I think - I think the difference in the Earth crescent sure must make a difference, the way you're talking of earthshine versus the way I saw it.
108:34:32|T|CMP|Oh, it's fantastic. You can see the whole thing. It's really something. I'm going to try that - that's the reason I wanted to try and get these earthshine pictures in this time before the Earth gets any smaller. Because it really isn't nearly as dramatic tonight as it was last night, and I don 't know whether that 's the altitude or what.
108:35:01|T|CMP|But if I - let's see, we want to run these booms out and what else? Got to turn the Pan Camera, Off. Okay, if you'll give me a call on those.
108:35:11|C|Roo|Roger. I'm watching for you on the boom deploy, Ken. You got a little less than 5 minutes.
108:35:20|T|CMP|Okay, I'll - You know something else that I'm not real sure about. It sure looks to me as though the earthshine is not as bright on this mare. I guess it's just this mare that's over around Fra Mauro and so forth is just darker, and maybe it's my night adaptation that hasn't taken affect yet, but I got the distinct impression that that band's [?] a lot brighter when you get over to the western limb.
108:35:52|C|Roo|Okay, got that, Ken.
108:35:57|T|CMP|I don't think I understand that.
108:36:17|T|CMP|I tell you, I thought this was kind of appropriate here. A few minutes ago, I was playing Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique and looking at this fantastic sight and floating along here, and it's just unbelievable it's so much fun.
108:36:31|C|Roo|Yes, it sure sounds like it; in fact, we were catching a little of your music occasionally there. Didn't sound as good as (laughter) Riding Old Paint", but I guess it'll do.
108:36:47|T|CMP|Well, I've been listening to "Old Paint" kind of music for three days of PTC. But it was good "Old Paint," I'll have to admit. I enjoyed it.
108:37:12|C|Roo|And, Casper; Houston.
108:37:15|T|CMP|Go ahead.
108:37:19|C|Roo|Okay, would - What we'd like to do now, Ken, is go ahead and put out the booms now and, as soon as you have them out, go ahead and start the - start your P20 running right now. It looks like we might be cramped a little bit to get your uplinks in, so we want to make sure that we get - all of the up-links completed here.
108:37:44|T|CMP|Okay. In other words, you want me to cancel the earthshine ?
108:37:52|C|Roo|Yes, that's what we are saying, Ken. We're just afraid we might be cutting it kind of tight on the up-link.
108:38:00|T|CMP|All right, that's in work.
108:38:02|C|Roo|Okay.
108:38:51|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, and we can take the Pan Camera Power to Off. The lens is stowed.
108:38:58|T|CMP|Okay. Pan Camera Power is Off.
108:39:02|C|Roo|Okay.
108:40:27|T|CMP|Okay, and I guess I might as well go ahead and put the booms out, hadn't I?
108:40:31|C|Roo|Roger. We'd - we'd like to have those out and, as soon as you complete that, let's go ahead and do the - go into the P20 that we're showing at 108 plus 50. Let's don't wait for that.
108:40:46|T|CMP|Okay, I'm already going there.
108:40:47|C|Roo|Oh, okay.
108:40:49|T|CMP|I'm doing a manual roll to get over there and spin it around.
108:40:54|C|Roo|Okay, very good.
108:41:06|T|CMP|And I guess I'd like to have a SIM bay configuration - what - what you think I should have at the end of - while I get ready to go to bed, what mechanical and electrical status, and let me crosscheck it to make sure I haven't forgotten something.
108:41:22|C|Roo|Okay. We'll get that for you.
108:42:02|T|CMP|Holy smokes.
108:45:06|C|Roo|And Casper, Houston. We've got that SIM bay configuration when you're ready.
108:45:13|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
108:45:15|C|Roo|Okay, it is your normal sleep configuration, with a change in the first digit of the top line. We're going to change that 0 to a 1. You will now have a configuration, minus 11111; second line is normal, 01222.
108:45:40|T|CMP|Okay, minus all ones; 01222. Thank you, sir.
108:45:44|C|Roo|Roger. And we'd like -
108:45:45|T|CMP|And just looked at the inlet screens and you're right, they're - Go ahead.
108:45:50|C|Roo|Okay, I copied your - your bit on the screens and we'd like B/D Roll for sleep tonight.
108:46:00|T|CMP|Okay, you'd like to do a B/D Roll. Okay. How does the general RCS picture look?
108:46:10|C|Roo|We're in - we're in good shape, Ken. We're down a little on the Flight Plan, but we're riding 168 above the above the red line. We're - On the Flight Plan, we're down a minus 133.
108:46:32|T|CMP|Okay.
108:46:35|C|Roo|And -
108:46:36|T|CMP|Eventful afternoon.
108:46:40|C|Roo|It'll all get done. You're doing a great job, Ken.
108:46:49|T|CMP|Well, I'm just real sorry about that delay this afternoon. I wish I had known more about it. I'd already decided that if it was - if it was just oscillatory and stable, I was going to take it.
108:47:07|C|Roo|Yes; well, I tell you, the - the traces on those up to the time that you turned off the gimbal motors were just a classic divergent curve, right out of the textbook.
108:47:19|T|CMP|Yes. Yes, I couldn't believe it when I saw that thing. Thought I was back in Floody's simulator.
108:47:32|C|Roo|Yes, I think there has been a lot of people talking about SimSup today. Wish we could just forget this one.
108:47:43|C|Roo|But, hey, I got a couple other reminders here while we're chatting. I'd like to remind you on your pre-sleep checklist that we'll not bump up the cabin tonight.
108:47:55|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
108:48:18|C|Roo|And, Ken, a couple other - or one other item here, you might get a leg up on your pre-sleep checklist and check the Optics Power, Off, at your convenience.
108:48:34|T|CMP|Okay, I'll get that stuff in just a minute.
108:48:38|C|Roo|Okay, I wasn't trying to hurry you, I just wanted to toss in a little reminder there.
108:48:45|T|CMP|Yes, thank you. I think I left it on last night.
108:48:50|C|Roo|That isn't what I was trying to say, Ken.
108:48:56|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well, you know what was going on last night and this morning. Everything you said was true. I got a garbage can in here that's bigger than me.
108:49:10|C|Roo|Roger.
108:50:20|C|Roo|And we'd like to have Omni Charlie now, Ken; and, when you get to attitude, you can reacquire with high gain.
108:50:28|T|CMP|Okay. Hey, that is better.
108:51:25|T|CMP|Hey, Stu, I kinda turned the - Hank off this morning when he tried to give us a - SIM bay status report, because it just wasn't - this morning wasn't a convenient time, but I'd be very happy to hear one of those tomorrow to see what people are finding out.
108:51:43|C|Roo|Okay. We'll give you a good one tomorrow.
108:52:00|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. Just at this appearance, it appears that everything is swinging along all right with them, but we'll have you a good scientific readout on it tomorrow.
108:52:13|T|CMP|All righty.
108:52:49|T|CMP|Hank said something about a - about the clock update. Are we going to do that tomorrow or tonight ?
108:52:57|C|Roo|That'll be done tomorrow, Ken. What we'd really like for you to do is get to - get to resting. Go into your sleep period just as soon as you can here.
108:53:12|T|CMP|Roger; I'm working on the pre-sleep checklist now.
108:53:15|C|Roo|Okay.
108:58:28|C|Roo|Casper, Houston. Would you give us the high gain just as soon as you can and go Accept.
108:59:43|C|Roo|Okay, Casper, if you'd give us Wide Beamwidth and Accept, please. We're about a minute and a half from LOS.
108:59:56|T|CMP|Okay, you've got Accept. You want Wide and Auto or what on Beam?
109:00:03|C|Roo|Roger. That's Wide and Auto, Ken.
109:00:34|C|Roo|Okay. Ken, if you can read, we'd like for you to go back to Block and - and load your Jet Monitor routine manually.
109:00:34|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 109 hours, 2 minutes. We've had loss of radio contact now with Apollo 16 Casper, as the Spacecraft went around the corner on its eighteenth revolution.

109:57:18|T|CMP|Okay. She's coming at you, bit by bit.
109:57:28|C|Pet|Roger.
109:59:01|C|Pet|Okay, Casper. We recommend you go B/D Roll, and that winds it up.
109:59:12|T|CMP|Yeah, thank you very much.
110:00:07|T|CMP|Okay, Don, I guess that's it. I'll see you folks tomorrow.
110:00:10|C|Pet|Okeydoke, Casper. Pleasant dreams.
110:00:17|T|CMP|You must know somebody to get a shift like this.
110:00:20|C|Pet|Say again, Casper.
110:00:25|T|CMP|You must know somebody to end up with a shift like this.
110:00:29|C|Pet|I'm afraid you're right.
110:00:37|T|CMP|Well, have lots of coffee anyhow. Good night.
110:00:40|C|Pet|Good

110:00:40|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston at 114 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. At this time I would like to repeat our previous announcement that Flight Director Gene Kranz has just completed a status discussion with [the] flight control team. A first cut preliminary flight plan has emerged. Our present plan is to shoot for the three EVA's, each of about seven hours duration. EVA 1 is set to start at 119 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. EVA 2 start time [is] 141 hours, 43 minutes GET. And EVA 3 about 165 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Each of these EVA's would be separated by [a] rest period of eight hours in essence. Surface activity would be flopping back to Apollo 15's tight schedule. The traverses for John Young and Charles Duke would be much like th[ose] planned pre-mission taking into account the later landing time. If this plan continues to hold good, the lunar liftoff will be at 177 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Needless to say the consumables outlook for Apollo 16 is favorable. The closest consumable item aboard Orion is water in the Descent system. And this is five to six hours above the three EVA margin and even this could be increased if needed by cutting down electrical power or using from the Ascent system to the equivalent of eight hours. In summary our outlook to this point is good. We show our wake up clock in Mission Control shows one hour, 36 minutes till time of wake up and our Ground Elapsed Time 114 hours, 17 minutes. Continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 114 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time.

117:53:30|C|Har|Good morning, Casper. Up and at them.
117:55:15|T|CMP|Hello, Houston. Are you there this morning?
117:55:19|C|Har|Good morning, Casper. How are you feeling this morning?
117:55:25|T|CMP|Swinging.
117:55:29|C|Har|You get a good night's rest?
117:55:34|T|CMP|Sure did. That's the best sleep I've had since I've been in here.
117:55:38|C|Har|Hey, that sounds great. Whenever you're ready to get a few things done before your eating period, let me know.
117:55:49|T|CMP|Okay. If you get some things for me to copy, I'll get started on that. Then we can catch up on the crew status when we get a chance.
117:55:59|C|Har|Okay. Before we get started, Ken, could you terminate the Bat A charge?
117:56:10|T|CMP|No sooner said than done.
117:56:33|C|Har|Okay, Ken, how about let's starting with the Flight Plan changes for a couple of revs here and get that out of the way?
117:56:52|T|CMP|Say, just a second. Let me check the test meter.
117:57:08|T|CMP|Okay, the battery compartment is sitting right at 1.5 volts. So, I guess the next time we go to do a dump and stuff, it wouldn't hurt to vent that, too.
117:57:19|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
117:57:35|T|CMP|Okay. Let's go.
117:57:37|C|Har|Okay. The - the first item is right here at the wakeup, 118 hours. We have already terminated the bat charge. We want to - we don't need to write all this in. I'll just tell you what we want to get from you is a film status report, which we didn't pick up last night. And, a little bit later here, we want to up-link the lift-off time. The first item really comes at 118:15 and there we want to put, "Sync mission timer to CMC clock." And that is a Verb 5 Noun 1 Enter, 1706 Enter. And then T<sub>ephem</sub> verification by MSFN. Copy on MSFN cue. I guess you're familiar with that procedure, aren't you?
117:58:30|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
117:58:32|C|Har|Okay, and they got a note here where we copy out three registers at the time - at the proper time. Okay, the next item is 118:55 - delete the charge Battery B.
117:58:52|T|CMP|Okay. Battery charge B charge is deleted.
117:59:06|C|Har|Okay, at - stand by a minute, Ken.
117:59:21|C|Har|Okay, Ken, that should get you through the next couple of revs. We are just gonna follow the Flight Plan. The - how about now let's set up our cryo configuration. We would like to verify the - that we're using the 100-volt heaters on O<sub>2</sub> . That's on Panel 226, I believe.
117:59:54|T|CMP|Okay, that's verified.
117:59:59|C|Har|Okay, and back on panel 2, we want O<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Auto, and 3, Off.
118:00:11|T|CMP|That's verified.
118:00:12|C|Har|H<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Off.
118:00:22|T|CMP|Okay, H<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Off.
118:00:26|C|Har|Roger. And H<sub>2</sub> fans, 1 and 2, Off, and 3, Auto.
118:00:37|T|CMP|Okay. Fans in Tank 3 are Auto.
118:00:53|C|Har|Okay, Ken, we got a message that says, "Do not vent the battery compartment.
118:01:02|T|CMP|Okay. I won't do that.
118:01:06|C|Har|Okay, the next item - We are wondering if you got the screens on the suit hoses. Those screens are normally stored in the PGA bags during launch and we don't know whether you ever got those on or not. If you didn't, you can put those on and get increased circulation in the cockpit, there.
118:01:30|T|CMP|Okay. No, we sure didn't. I plugged up the inlet side so that it wouldn't get dirt in them and then he put the screens on. I'll - I'll do that.
118:01:41|C|Har|Okay, just make a note to yourself there to get that done. Okay, I'll tell you a little bit about SIM Bay status here. Mapping camera is working fine; no anomalies. The only problem we had was that retract. And our plan on that is that we are going to leave the mapping camera out except when we are doing coupled RCS. The laser altimeter has fired 663 times since launch. But it is starting to miss now about 20 percent of the time on the altitudes. Pan camera's working fine; no anomalies. We've got a margin of 58 frames. I forgot to give you margins on the mapping camera. We're 452 frames ahead there. Mass spec is performing good. And the extend/retract performance is good except that the boom is hanging up near full or retraction. You are aware of that. However, the boom has been verified safe for SPS burns. The gamma ray is getting good data. The gain is stable and has excellent resolution. Boom performance is nominal. X-ray and alpha particles are both good.
118:03:07|T|CMP|Okay. Have they seen anything unusual on any of their data yet?
118:03:13|C|Har|That's negative, Ken. And, if you will give us Accept, we'll get on with your state vector updates. Stand by - That's clock update.
118:03:23|T|CMP|You got them.
118:03:40|C|Har|And, for your information on planning, we're not going to reschedule any extra mapping camera or pan camera passes today to make up for what we missed yesterday. We're just going to go with the Flight Plan.
118:03:55|T|CMP|Okay.
118:03:58|C|Har|And - in regard to the booms, we are gonna do - follow the nominal extension and retractions for the mass spec, except we are going to try to get the retractions done during AOS, so we can watch it.
118:04:19|T|CMP|Okay, that sounds good, and - was the mapping camera retract time really as long as I thought it was?
118:04:33|C|Har|Stand by.
118:04:41|C|Har|That's affirmative, Ken. They got 03:15 on their data down here.
118:04:49|T|CMP|Okay.
118:04:53|C|Har|And, in regard to your EKG, sometime when you get a chance here, we want you to service the - the leads there. Want you to doff your harness, replace the sponges and tape, and don it again.
118:05:09|T|CMP|Okay, that's about - that's about a 20-minute job.
118:05:14|C|Har|Just whenever you can work it in. No real rush there -
118:05:17|T|CMP|... piecemeal, if I get a chance.
118:05:50|C|Har|And, Ken, consumables status looks just about like it was when you went to bed last night. Nothing really to report there. And I guess, we can go ahead and start on your post-sleep checklist and we'll be standing by for your crew status report and SIM status report.
118:06:13|T|CMP|Okay, I'll have that for you in just a minute.
118:09:17|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I am ready for our little crew status update. Then, - let's see. You want me to take the Mass Spec, Ion Source, to Standby now?
118:09:29|C|Har|Roger, Ken. Go ahead.
118:09:39|T|CMP|Okay, it's in Standby. I'll get - Pan Camera Mode is in Standby and the Power is coming On -
118:09:47|T|CMP|Mark.
118:09:48|T|CMP|Barber pole, back to gray. Okay, ready for a little crew status.
118:09:58|C|Har|Roger; go ahead.
118:10:07|T|CMP|Okay, Bravo 1, 15048; Bravo 3, 6-1/2 - the best yet; Bravo 4, none. On the menu side, the happy gourmet says that meal A for Mattingly: was a large orange juice with potassium. Meal B was - and then breakfast, a chocolate bar, sugar cookies, and another citrus beverage with potassium. Meal C - chicken and rice, two orange drinks, fruit cocktail, pineapple fruitcake. I got - I guess yesterday morning - for the Commander, you can delete the peaches, you can delete the grits on the LMP. You can delete the peaches, you can delete the eggs, and you can add an extra orange pineapple with potassium.
118:11:49|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We got all that.
118:14:14|C|Har|Casper, Houston. You're cleared for Pan Camera Power, Off. The lens is tucked.
118:14:27|T|CMP|Okay, I'll get that in just a second.
118:15:36|T|CMP|Pan Camera Power is Off.
118:15:38|C|Har|Okay.
118:15:53|C|Har|And, Ken. We are up - up-linking the state vector to you now.
118:16:00|T|CMP|Okay.
118:18:45|C|Har|Casper, Houston. The computer is yours.
118:18:51|T|CMP|Okay, thank you, sir.
118:21:00|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Whenever you get a chance, we can take the Gamma Ray Shield, Off and the Mass Spec Ion Source, On.
118:21:09|T|CMP|Mass Spec Ion Source is On; the Gamma Ray Shield is Off; Shield is Off.
118:21:18|C|Har|Roger.
118:22:31|C|Har|Ken, no need to acknowledge, but give us a call when you get ready to sync your mission timer.
118:22:38|T|CMP|Okay, I'm trying to catch this photograph of Davy, and I'm almost over it now.
118:23:23|T|CMP|It looks to me like I'm not going to be able to get it because the terminator isn't quite far enough over this time. I guess we're far enough off on our basic here.
118:23:32|C|Har|Okay, you say Davy hadn't moved out into the light, yet?
118:23:40|T|CMP|No, the terminator is lying just to the west of Ptolemaeus. I can see the highlands and I think I see probably the first crater chain - first of the craters in the chain. And, in fact, that may be Davy G. But the rest of it is still in the shadow.
118:24:02|C|Har|Roger.
118:24:03|T|CMP|I guess I will have to let that one go today. Okays well, let's get back to where you were.
118:24:43|T|CMP|Yeah, what's happening here, Hank. It looks like we are a little bit early, but it still looks like those times would have been - these times probably weren't gonna quite hack it anyhow.
118:24:55|C|Har|I am a little bit puzzled by this, too, Ken. That should have been good.
118:24:57|T|CMP|Okay, and I am ready. Okay, let's see. We need to catch up on T<sub>ephem</sub>, right?
118:25:08|C|Har|That's affirmative.
118:25:21|T|CMP|Okay, that's what I show on 1706.
118:25:33|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We got the numbers. It looks good.
118:25:50|T|CMP|Okay, and I copied them down. Well, we can sync the mission timers to that, huh?
118:26:00|C|Har|That's affirmative.
118:29:05|C|Har|Ken, in regard to that Davy thing - I was just talking to Spence and he says that the - that was the correct time and that - that - where they call officially the terminator. And the photo setting should have worked. But it sounds like from what you said, it may have been a little too dark.
118:29:27|T|CMP|(Laughter) There's nothing but hard shadows down there where Davy is. Maybe - maybe the rim of Ptolemaeus there's - and Alphonsus, and that area is a little higher than we calculated because it wouldn't have to be off by much in order to keep you from - from missing it. I - after we talked about it there - why, looked out the side to the south, and it looked like further south in the mare. The terminator did go out a little further. So, I think we got caught by elevation.
118:29:59|C|Har|I suspect that's the case, Ken.
118:30:08|T|CMP|Okay, I'll whip into a little P52 here.
118:31:03|T|CMP|Hey, Hank.
118:31:31|T|CMP|Well, there's the old Earth, again. And it's getting smaller. I think it's not sanforized.
118:31:36|C|Har|Roger (laughter).
118:31:46|C|Har|Ken, in your post-sleep, did you terminate the jet monitor?
118:31:52|T|CMP|Oh, hey - no. Let me write that out on my post-sleep checklist right now. They wrote that in as an extra item yesterday, and I forgot it this morning.
118:32:20|T|CMP|It sure pays to have you guys watching.
118:32:22|C|Har|Well, I just happened to think of that one, and I got to thinking about your P52, using SCS, and then I wondered about the jet monitor program.
118:32:39|T|CMP|For that one, you get the award for the year. That was smooth.
118:33:14|C|Har|And, Ken. Whenever you get a chance, Gamma Ray, Shield, On. When you get through with this.
118:33:30|T|CMP|Okay, Gamma Ray Shield is coming On -
118:33:33|T|CMP|Mark it.
118:38:14|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We got the 93. You are clear -
118:38:14|||<p class="tech"><b>118 38 ]6 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you folks have the angles.
118:38:14|||<p class="tech"><b>118 38 ]7 Hartsfield:</b> - to torque.
118:38:19|T|CMP|Okay, I'll do it at 10.
118:38:58|C|Har|And, Casper; Houston. Got a little update to you there for that dead band test. We'd like to change the 5 degrees to 2-1/2 degrees.
118:39:09|T|CMP|Okay. Make that 2-1/2.
118:39:53|C|Har|And, Ken. Since we updated the clock, we need to update the time on the T<sub>ig</sub> for the TEI-26. The rest of the TEI-26 PAD's good. So, whenever you are ready to copy, I'll read you the new T<sub>ig</sub>.
118:40:09|T|CMP|Okay. Just a second. Let me get my GDC here. This GDC is working a lot better. When we started out, I made a drift check on it, you know - right after insertion, and it was drifting pretty readily. And now, this thing will go for six hours and be off less than ten degrees. I guess it just - maybe once it got warmed up, it just sort of stabilized, and it's really - really doing a good job now.
118:40:43|C|Har|Hey, that sounds real great.
118:40:48|T|CMP|Yeah, it is particularly nice to know (laughter).
118:41:25|T|CMP|Okay. Why don't you give me a new time for TEI-26?
118:41:29|C|Har|Roger. T<sub>ig</sub> is 125:26:15.47.
118:41:49|T|CMP|Okay, that is 25:26:15.47.
118:41:56|C|Har|Roger. That's 125.
118:42:10|T|CMP|Yeah - yeah, 125. Thank you.
118:42:40|T|CMP|And I got the Purge Line Heaters On.
118:42:45|C|Har|Roger; copy.
118:42:46|T|CMP|And, about now, suppose I give you - try to give you a rundown on the film.
118:42:52|C|Har|Okay. Go ahead, Ken.
118:42:54|T|CMP|Didn't use any of the - we didn't use any of the UV film yesterday - that's magazine Oscar Oscar. Magazine Sierra Sierra reads 20 frames. I'm just going to have to go through the film locker here and pull out mags and tell you what's on them.
118:43:26|T|CMP|Okay, November November is completed.
118:44:33|T|CMP|And, Victor - we're only up to 8.
118:44:03|T|CMP|On the 35 millimeter, I used the - well, we didn't finish up that CIN roll that the ALFMED was on; it's the same status it had then, but I had to take it out in order to get X-ray X-ray put in - the earthshine, which we didn't get last night, and if we're gonna get it, we ought to get it right soon because that Earth is getting considerably smaller. The - I had to take that CIN mag out, unfortunately. And I'll go through the 16s here. I used portions - two of them, one for the undocking sequences and one for the landmark tracking.
118:46:24|T|CMP|And magazine Charlie Charlie, I'm showing 60 percent; that's 60.
118:46:59|T|CMP|And on magazine - Bravo Bravo, I have 80 percent.
118:47:16|T|CMP|I think that should be all of the film, Hank.
118:47:18|C|Har|Okay. We got it, Ken.
118:47:33|C|Har|And, Ken, I've got one more Flight Plan update for you.
118:47:39|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
118:47:48|C|Har|Stand by one minute.
118:48:57|C|Har|Ken, I'll read this change up to you next time. About what it amounts to is we're going to delete the bistatic radar and in its place, we're going to put an oblique photo pass. And I - I'll catch you on the next rev with it. We got about 4&frac12; minutes to LOS.
118:49:16|T|CMP|Okay.
118:50:34|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We lost comm there a little - a little while. We're about three minutes from LOS, and everything's looking good. Have a good breakfast, and we'll see you on the next rev.
118:51:41|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
118:51:46|T|CMP|Go ahead.
118:51:47|C|Har|Roger. We show your Manual Attitude in Accel Command.
118:52:10|T|CMP|Well, thank you. I wonder how - how that one happened. I tell you it's pretty easy to kick a switch when you're rolling around in here. You chase a piece of the Flight Plan away from you or you kick a camera, and that's not an unusual thing to happen. I appreciate you telling me about it.
118:52:32|C|Har|Roger.
119:41:32|T|CMP|Hello down there.
119:41:35|C|Har|Hello, Casper.
119:41:41|T|CMP|We're still here.
119:41:44|C|Har|Roger. How did everything go?
119:41:46|T|CMP|Sure do feel a lot better. (Laughter) I got quite a bit done on that little back-side section there.
119:41:57|C|Har|Hey, that sounds great. First thing off the bat here, Ken, we'd like to get a Bat B charge going.
119:42:09|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
119:42:51|T|CMP|Okay, you've got it.
119:42:54|C|Har|Roger. And for your info, Ken, the E-Mod we got last night looks good.
119:43:09|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
119:43:17|C|Har|And, Ken, I got a few items for you whenever you're ready to work them in. I've got a mapping camera photo PAD, a Flight Plan update, and an update to your erasable loads, and a G&amp;C checklist, whenever you can get a break from eating there.
119:43:34|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, I'm just getting a good start on that. And I'll copy those as we go along here. If you'll give me a couple of minutes to get some things going.
119:46:21|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I'm ready to copy.
119:46:26|C|Har|Okay. We'll start with the Flight Plan changes. And the first one's at 123:26.
119:46:42|T|CMP|Okay.
119:46:43|C|Har|Incidentally, Ken. Did you get the urine dump and purges out on the last back side?
119:46:50|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
119:46:52|C|Har|Okay. At 123:26, we're going to delete the maneuver to Bistatic Radar attitude; we're going to delete the Bistatic, as we told you earlier. At the top of the next column there, about 123:32, delete all of that where you configure the S-band. Following that, delete the - or the VHF. Following that, delete the S-band; delete the P20 following that. In fact, delete everything in that column. And delete the Bistatic Radar over to the right-hand side at the bottom.
119:47:30|T|CMP|Okay.
119:47:32|C|Har|Okay. Now back at 123:26, we want to add in there this 40-degree south oblique - a P20 option 5; 40-degree south oblique photo attitude. Parenthe - see - see - parentheses 123:31. Your Noun 78 is plus 270.00, plus 087.75, plus 180.00. Noun 79, plus 000.50; attitude 182,000 underlined slash 080, 000. Set High Gain Pitch 10, Yaw 350 for AOS acquisition.
119:48:59|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I copy 40-degrees south oblique, replacing the Bistatic Radar; P20 option 5 at 123:31; Noun 78, plus 270, plus 87.75, plus 180. Noun 79 is 0.50, giving me an attitude of 182, 080, and 000. And the Pitch 10 and Yaw 350 for acquisition.
119:49:24|C|Har|That's a good readback. And on the next page, you can delete the Bistatic Radars in both columns. And at 124 - wait, take it back - let's go back to the previous page - lost something there; 123:31. We want to add, at 123:31 -
119:49:48|T|CMP|Okay.
119:49:49|C|Har|Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On, T-start; and Image Motion, barber pole plus 3, and then On.
119:50:10|T|CMP|Okay. Do you have a T-start time?
119:50:13|C|Har|We'll get that up to you in a PAD; that's still a long ways away.
119:50:19|T|CMP|Okay.
119:50:22|C|Har|Then over at 124:32, we want Mapping Camera, Off at T-stop.
119:50:33|T|CMP|Wait a min - one - wait a minute. Say - say the time again.
119:50:36|C|Har|124:32, on the next page.
119:50:43|T|CMP|Okay.
119:50:44|C|Har|Mapping -
119:50:45|T|CMP|Got it.
119:50:46|C|Har|Mapping Camera, Off, T-stop; wait 30 seconds; Mapping Camera to Standby; and Image Motion, Off.
119:51:02|T|CMP|Okay.
119:51:03|C|Har|And could you give us Auto on the High Gain?
119:51:08|T|CMP|You've got it.
119:51:10|C|Har|Okay, and the last change is at 125:06, the following page. Delete the P52, about 125:06 there.
119:51:23|T|CMP|Got it. That sure is a super little platform, isn't it?
119:51:28|C|Har|Boy, it's a beauty.
119:51:42|C|Har|Okay. I have a - a mapping camera photo PAD.
119:51:58|C|Har|This PAD goes at 121:35, approximately.
119:52:11|T|CMP|Okay.
119:52:13|C|Har|All righty. T-start is 121:32:18; T-stop, 122:32:08.
119:52:30|T|CMP|Okay; 121:32:18, 122:32:08.
119:52:38|C|Har|And the last item I have for you is a change to your erasable loads and the G&amp;C -
119:52:43|T|CMP|Okay, just - just a second, Hank, let me write those down.
119:53:11|T|CMP|Okay. I got a PAD for the erasables. All right, let me find that. I just wanted to write the T-stop times down before I got away from them.
119:53:23|C|Har|Okay. This is in your G&amp;C Checklist on page 9-4.
119:53:31|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going after it. I've got it.
119:53:40|C|Har|All righty. In column A, OID 05 change 03773 to read 03521.
119:53:52|T|CMP|Whoop, whoops. I missed that, Hank.
119:54:00|C|Har|Okay.
119:54:01|T|CMP|I guess I'm going to have to do one thing or the other. I can't talk and eat at the same time.
119:54:04|C|Har|Okay. Whenever you're ready, we'll - you - If you don't want to do it now, just holler.
119:54:11|T|CMP|Okay. Let me finish this eat period.
119:54:14|C|Har|Okay.
119:54:17|T|CMP|I got - I got carried away with trying to get ahead.
119:55:06|T|CMP|Hey, Hank. If you got time while I'm - while I can listen, and - how about telling me if there's - you got any words on the general EVA plan for the surface and - guys are doing.
119:55:23|C|Har|Okay. The guys are outside now on the surface. They got the Rover deployed and they're checking it out. And they're going to try to do the nominal number 1 EVA plan. As - about as far as we can predict in the future right now is through - doing the second EVA tomorrow. We don't know how consumables are going to hold out for the - for the thing. We're going to have to take a look at it - whether there's a possibility of the third one or not. Right now, I'm not so sure.
119:55:56|T|CMP|There - there still is some chance, huh?
119:55:59|C|Har|Well, it doesn't look too bright, but they're looking at it.
119:56:15|T|CMP|Have they got the ALSEP out yet? Or does that come after the Rover?
119:56:19|C|Har|That comes after the Rover.
120:02:37|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Just a little reminder - about time for - to open the alpha particle X-ray cover.
120:02:47|T|CMP|Okay. I'll - Thank you, sir.
120:02:57|T|CMP|Alpha cover, Open -
120:02:58|T|CMP|Mark. And it's gray.
120:07:47|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I'm ready to copy your erasable updates.
120:07:57|C|Har|Say again, Casper.
120:08:02|T|CMP|I'm ready to copy the erasables.
120:08:05|C|Har|Okay. In column A there - column alpha - OID 05.
120:08:12|T|CMP|This is on 9-4.
120:08:14|C|Har|That's affirmative. A -
120:08:18|T|CMP|Okay.
120:08:19|C|Har|The old data should read 03773. The new data there should be 03521.
120:08:34|T|CMP|03521.
120:08:37|C|Har|That's affirmative. Column A again. OID 07 reads now 76747; new data, 76274.
120:08:55|T|CMP|Okay. 07 now reads 76274.
120:09:00|C|Har|Roger. Column Bravo, OID 04. Now reads 13353; new data, 13347.
120:09:18|T|CMP|A, 13347.
120:09:22|C|Har|Column Bravo, OID 05. Old data, 00041; new data, 65620.
120:09:42|T|CMP|Okay. New data, 65620. That's column Bravo, 05.
120:09:48|C|Har|That's correct, Ken, and that's all of that. I hate to go back, but along about 125:06, when we deleted that P52, we should have deleted the P00 that went right ahead of it.
120:10:10|T|CMP|Okay. Let me come back to that in just a second. I'm passing over Madler now; and, if you remember, we talked about that funny - bright ray pattern - how it seemed to have a funny shape that it - it took off in one direction and then it made a straight line in the other. Well, there's a textural difference in the ground that's underneath that bright material. It's a - It looks like it's - more like highlands - kind of overlay that's on top of a regular mare material. And it does, in fact, go along those - that line of demarcation that we see, and it seems to overlay the - the mare-type, and it's - it doesn't go very far to the south and it doesn't go very far to the west. It's right along that line where you see it. And then there's a little wrinkle - a little cluster of craters and ridges that goes along with the - line of - that goes between Madler and that bright-rayed crater with an excluded zone to the south of them - or that's to the southeast. I just remembered that question, and - I wanted to pop that in. There's also a crater directly south of Theophilus that has a - a dark halo around it, and maybe we'll get a better look at it later. He's about one crater diameter south of Theophilus, and it's about the size of the little crater in the northern end of Theophilus. And when I say dark, it's really just sort of a - of a little darker brown than the rest of the material. And it's in the middle of an area that's kind of wrinkled. Then there's another little crater just to the north and east of that that has three - a cluster of three craters around his northern rim. And he, too, has a dark halo, and his dark halo is about one and a half crater diameters, and the larger one to the south is about one and a half crater diameters. Okay. Let's go back and - you said something about - working on a P52, and then I deleted that, and I should have deleted a P00 that went with it?
120:12:33|C|Har|That's affirmative, Ken. We didn't catch that until after we called it up. It's the 125:06 there. We deleted a P52 and we should also delete the P00. Just keep the place ...
120:12:46|T|CMP|Okay. That's deleted. All right. And I'm going - to try to get a hack on the landing site as we come across it.
120:12:58|C|Har|Roger; and -
120:12:59|T|CMP|Were you able to copy reasonably on vox?
120:13:02|C|Har|Yes, sir. I'm reading you five by five.
120:13:09|T|CMP|Okay. I wasn't sure how much it might be clipping on you.
120:13:19|T|CMP|I've got the camera ready for our pictures of Alphonsus, and it appears to me I ought to be able to catch Alphonsus and the Davy Crater chain at the same time. They ought to both be in the Sun this time.
120:13:32|C|Har|Hey, that's real good, Ken.
120:13:39|T|CMP|Okay. We're stealing along here and I just passed Kant; and I tell you, these things aren't nearly as dramatic as they were down in that low pass. When you came over the Kant Plateau down low, it really looked like the ground was coming up. And I'm crossing the crater Descartes and that bright area; and, again, that surface of that bright area - it doesn't look nearly as distinct as it did in the low Sun. I have the landing site in the binoculars now. I can look down into South Ray, and it really is a jumbled thing. I can see one bright layer, then a dark layer, then a bright layer, and then a dark layer on the south - or on the west side. And on the south, it looks like some of the same. And I can't see into the shadows very well to the north. I'm looking over at the - Well, let's see here. I'm over - around the - I've got Double Spot in the binoculars; and let's see if I can see anything in that area.
120:14:40|C|Har|Can you see the LM?
120:14:48|T|CMP|Well, I was hoping I could say yes, but I don't think I do. Let us go back here and - It looks like there is one little ridge-lines around a - a - It'd be that first crater that they come up to. It's Flag or Spook. I'm upside down in my thinking that way, too. I've got the Cinco Craters and - Those terraces that we talked about that were over in - in Stone Mountain don't stand out very well from here. Looks to me like you've got a lot of the same lineations that we've seen in the other places - looks like some slumping further around than where they're going to be going up. I don't think they'll be able to recognize terraces as such.
120:15:46|C|Har|Roger.
120:15:49|T|CMP|The - the - the northwest - I mean northeast - correction - side of that extension of Stone Mountain has what I would have called slumping if it were on the inside of a crater.
120:18:02|C|Har|Okay, Ken, you got about a couple of minutes to go before the terminator photos.
120:18:09|T|CMP|Okay, I'm getting set up now, trying to get myself oriented to the best window. I tell you, I know it's not supposed to make any difference that if you're going backwards or not, but it sure does.
120:18:20|C|Har|Roger.
120:18:38|T|CMP|Okay. There's Albategnius, and he's got a nice Cayley floor and a whole bunch of the - like a concentric ring, but I can't - Yeah, by golly, there's a concentric ring in that thing just like there is in the mare. And - it goes most of the way around. Some places it's overlain with the - like the crater Klein hides it.
120:19:36|T|CMP|Okay. The - the floor of Alphonsus is still quite shadowed.
120:19:48|C|Har|Okay, Ken, and we're coming up on a site handover. We may lose comm for a second.
120:19:56|T|CMP|Okay.
120:20:21|T|CMP|Hank, are you still here?
120:20:22|C|Har|That's affirmative.
120:20:27|T|CMP|Okay, looking at Alphonsus, I'd say that there's this a - well, you can see this obvious little band that we talked about that runs north and south through there. And that's an entirely different texture than what you see on the material on either side of it. But it is the same on either side. Looking from north to south, I don't see anything that's - I can really call - I couldn't - that says there's any topographic relief going from south to north. There's no demarcation that's evident that's different at all. Although there is some of this material that's in the south that runs towards the crater center that does, indeed, look like it might - might be tapering down and thinning out. I'll come back to that in just a minute. Let me pick up Davy.
120:21:51|T|CMP|Well, I tell you. We aren't going to get Davy on this pass either.
120:21:55|C|Har|Still in the shadows?
120:22:01|T|CMP|Sure is. You can just see the shadows run - oh, gosh, I'd say a - [vox] er of a - a quarter of a crater diameter of the size of Ptolemaeus out. And it goes to just about where - Davy G isn't obvious. I think I've got Davy G, but that's not - not obvious that I can. And- and then the rest of it just disappears. Even the central peak in Albatrajious [sic] doesn't show.
120:22:51|C|Har|I wouldn't have expected that one.
120:22:57|T|CMP|No, no. Neither would I. Well, another day.
120:23:46|T|CMP|Hey, and, Henry, the frame number on magazine SS is now 25.
120:23:52|C|Har|Roger; copy 25.
120:24:03|T|CMP|Okay, I'll get a lil - canister change.
120:28:55|C|Har|Casper, Houston. The rate in your Flight Plan about not starting until 121:05 is still good.
120:29:04|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. Thank you, sir.
120:36:54|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Forgot to ask you. Did you see anything on that last back-side pass that's worthy of commenting on?
120:37:08|T|CMP|No, sir; I did not. I didn't even get my head out of the cockpit.
120:37:14|C|Har|Roger.
120:50:20|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We are about two minutes from LOS and everything is looking good. If you don't have anything else, we'll see you on the other side.
120:50:32|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. And, I'm all set up to take the Gum Nebula, and I've checked the star patterns, and they all work out just fine. So, I'll see you at AOS.
120:50:41|C|Har|Good show.
121:50:07|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Could you bring up the High Gain - according to the Flight Plan?
121:51:48|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
121:51:52|T|CMP|Hello there.
121:51:54|C|Har|Hello; how's things going?
121:51:55|T|CMP|I been trying, Hank ... I don't know. That - that acquisition there wasn't as smooth as I thought it might be. I tried to get you using manual to tweak it up a little bit and that didn't seem to help much. Maybe I'm not helping at all, maybe I'm hurting.
121:52:34|T|CMP|I saw one thing that was - that was new about the zodiacal-light world. You don't realize that that stuff is actually reasonably bright until - you get yourself well dark-adopted then you sit up there long enough to recognize it. But almost - almost immediately after - oh, I'd say within - certainly within five minutes and maybe a little sooner after LOS, there was enough zodiacal light or solar corona - whichever is the proper technical name - that you could see a distinct horizon. And it just got more distinct right up until sunrise. I never did see any prominences or anything like that. I kind of thought that maybe we would, but I guess those are too small a scale. But, just prior to sunrise, you see a lot of long streaks and that's - well, I say just prior - that's like just a few seconds before sunrise. All of a sudden, you get these very prominent rays coming out and then the Sun's right there. You don't want to be looking at that.
121:53:41|C|Har|Roger; copy -
121:53:42|T|CMP|But it is right - right pretty to watch that stuff at night.
121:53:51|C|Har|Sounds like a real pretty sight. INCO says that - that they saw you in Narrow when you were trying to bring the High Gain up and that you'd have a little better luck with Wide.
121:54:08|T|CMP|Okay, you're right. I looked down at the Flight Plan and saw a Reacq and Narrow. And then I went back to Manual. I - I may have had it in Narrow all along. Thank you.
121:54:37|C|Har|Ken, I got a - a - zodiacal-light, mapping camera photo PADs for you, and TEI-32 block data.
121:54:49|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by. I'm going to get my books.
121:54:55|C|Har|If you want to start with the photo PADs, the zodiacal light you copy at 123:12.
121:55:10|T|CMP|Okay, I got that and I also kind of got intrigued back along about - back along about King was the first chance I had to get all squared away again from the - the low-light-level stuff, so I didn't get a chance to look at as much back there as I had hoped, but - back around King, pretty interesting stuff again - was looking at a crater and some of the beds and things that are in it - apparent beds - and I'm convinced now that we're not seeing beds at all. Through the binoculars, it looks like those things are dark material and light material that slumped together, and why they formed shelves like that I don't have any idea, but you can't trace them through - if they are stratigraphy, then they are indeed - not only have you had horizontal stratigraphy but you've had a great deal of vertical fractures that's caused these things to slide in different proportions. Because there's no continuous horizontal strata and you don't realize that until you look at it in detail. Okay, I got my Updates Book out and I got my Flight Plan here, so you can take the photo PAD just if you like.
121:56:24|C|Har|Okay, the first one is - the zodiacal light at 123:12; T-start is 123 -
121:56:34|T|CMP|I got it.
121:56:38|C|Har|- 09:38
121:56:44|T|CMP|Okay, 123:09:38.
121:56:49|C|Har|Okay, the next one comes at 123:32. There's not a block there for that one because we added that in. But T-start for the mapping camera is 123:31:12; T-stop is 124:31:02.
121:57:16|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I just got 31:12 for the start time. I'm writing that in. I don't have a PAD and T-stop - tell me again please.
121:57:26|C|Har|T-stop: 124:31:02.
121:57:33|T|CMP|Okay.
121:57:37|C|Har|And the next map - mapping camera PAD is at 125:30.
121:57:49|T|CMP|125:30. Okay.
121:57:53|C|Har|T-start is 125:30:05; T-stop, 126:29:55.
121:58:08|T|CMP|Okay, 125:30:05, 126:29:55.
121:58:12|C|Har|Good readback.
121:58:14|T|CMP|Let me mark that before you give me any more.
121:58:44|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
121:58:46|C|Har|Are you ready for the TEI-32 block?
121:58:51|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
121:58:53|C|Har|Okay, TEI-32. SPS/G&amp;N; 38709; plus 0.72, plus 1.33; 137:12:07.88; Noun 81, plus 2922.0, plus 0699.7, minus 0120.2; 181, 110, 015; rest of the PAD's NA. The set stars, same as circ, two jets, 17 seconds. Other: lambda Moon at T<sub>IG</sub> - minus 161.32, and landing site REFSMMAT.
122:00:20|T|CMP|Okay, TEI-32: SPS/G&amp;N; 38709; plus 0.72, plus 1.33; 137;12:07.88; plus 2922.0, plus 0699.7, minus 0120.2; 181, 110, 015. Set stars same as circ; two jets, 17 seconds; lambda, minus 161.32; and this is the landing REFSMMAT.
122:00:53|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
122:02:31|T|CMP|Hank, can you give me any coordinates on the LM estimated position?
122:02:38|C|Har|I'll work on that, Ken. And did you take any earthshine photos?
122:02:45|T|CMP|No, sir. I - I tried to get them in last night and we decided they'd close up shop before I could get them in.
122:02:54|C|Har|Okay -
122:02:55|T|CMP|And, I tell you it's going down. It was much more dramatic the first night than it was last night and it's not as dramatic tonight on the night-side so, if you can find a place to put it, that is one thing I'd like to get. The sooner the better.
122:03:12|C|Har|Okay. FAO advises that if you didn't take any earthshines that magazine X-ray X-ray is - which is - I think already have on the Nikon is good for the zodiacal light rather than changing to Yankee Yankee. And on this next rev -
122:03:28|T|CMP|Yes, sir; I'd planned to do that.
122:03:31|C|Har|On next rev, you could - if you want to take some earthshine, they suggest Window 4 and take away.
122:03:44|T|CMP|Window 4.
122:03:53|T|CMP|Okay. I guess I'll have to check the attitude. Do they - if I take the zodiacal light on X-Ray X-Ray, you'd - do they have a recommended magazine?
122:04:03|C|Har|Stand by.
122:05:21|C|Har|Okay, Ken. I've got a film story for you. If you choose to do the earthshine, use mag XX and window 4 and the target should be about - You should see it about 122:42. If you don't do the earthshine, you can go ahead and use XX for 30 - the zodiacal. If you do the earthshine, of course, with the XX, you need the YY per Flight Plan for the zodiacal.
122:05:50|T|CMP|Okay. I don't think it'd be prudent for me to try and get the earthshine and the zodiacal light on the same rev.
122:05:58|C|Har|Okay. Copy. And the Surgeon is still anxious to see you sometime find a place to change out the sensors.
122:06:09|T|CMP|Roger. I understand that.
122:06:24|T|CMP|Hey, do you need them all changed, Hank, or can you send me to one so I don't have to waste time with all that stuff? You got to break out each one of those little things by itself and keep track of it. It - it takes a good 20 minutes if you change out the whole sensors.
122:06:36|C|Har|Stand by one.
122:07:11|C|Har|Ken, the surgeon says he can't tell which - which one of the sensors is dead, so before we take off here and do them all, why don't you try pressing down on them and let him - let him watch his data - maybe we can find out which one is the dead one. Press them one at a time.
122:07:27|T|CMP|Okay. Let me - okay. I'll start on the ground. I'm pressing the ground now.
122:07:45|C|Har|Okay. That didn't do it.
122:07:51|T|CMP|Okay. I'll go to the - the sternal.
122:08:11|C|Har|That seemed to make it worse, Ken.
122:08:16|T|CMP|That's making it worse?
122:08:18|C|Har|Yes. That's probably the culprit, but let's -
122:08:19|T|CMP|Well, maybe that's my problem.
122:08:20|C|Har|- try the third one while you're at it.
122:08:24|T|CMP|Okay.
122:08:44|C|Har|That makes the trace a lot better, Ken. I imagine it's the third one there.
122:08:52|T|CMP|Okay. I'll try changing those two out.
122:08:56|C|Har|Okay.
122:09:40|T|CMP|Boy, I'll tell you. That - that little Sun-angle change - old North and South Ray really stand out now. You couldn't miss those for anything.
122:10:00|C|Har|And, Ken, for your information, John and Charlie are almost through getting the ALSEP out.
122:10:10|T|CMP|Okay. Sounds good. Like an EVA should.
122:10:16|C|Har|Roger.
122:10:22|T|CMP|I know that's a bad one, but you know that's about all I can do for you today. That's probably safer than having you tell me jokes.
122:10:49|T|CMP|Okay. With the binocs on the area now, I'm looking down into North Ray Crater and South Ray and the interior structures of those two don't look quite the same. There's a lot more light and dark material in the South Ray; but that may be caused by the fact that it's just a- it really has been a fresher-appearing crater all around. The areas - trying to see if I can see any shadows or anything - There's a bright spot down there, but I think that's just a double spot itself. I don't see anything with the binocs that I could say I could see - I can't stabilize them quite that well. Coming down the traverse route from - where they're going across Survey Ridge - I don't think Survey is going to be easy to spot. And when you get down - there is one definite terrace - Looks like the - looks like Stone Mountain is formed with one, two, three terraces, but they are much larger than the kind of things that we were drawing on the map. The rest of that is very fine subtle lineations. The area around North Ray, particularly up along the area that they were going on the EVA - I can see it now, and it almost looks like that little pile of material that runs up to the south of their track and I'll give you some coordinates on that. I'm looking at my chart a - oh, let's see, 9 Charlie - yes, let's look at Chart 9 Charlie. And there's - this is a pretty lousy picture, but if you'll remember at a point about CY by 79, if you'll draw a line there and then draw a line down to about CU and 81, that's a - that represents a ridge, which shows up in the photographs. And looking down on it vertically, that looks like sort of a flow of material that runs up over the lip of North Ray and down into it. And it shows some craters on it, but it almost looks like a flow that runs up and down into North Ray rather than being some of the other kinds of things we've talked about. And I didn't have much time, I'll try to concentrate on that on the next rev.
122:13:31|C|Har|Roger. Good show, Ken.
122:13:55|C|Har|Ken, do you want the LM coordinates in lat-long or do you want it in coordinates on 9 Charlie?
122:14:03|T|CMP|Oh, I'd like to have it in 9 Charlie kind of coordinates. That's about the only thing I have to reference to.
122:14:08|C|Har|That's what I figured.
122:14:09|T|CMP|Let me see here if I can get - can get one last chance on our old friend that - Maybe and maybe see if he's decided to show his face this time. Don't let me forget the mapping camera, that comes about the same time.
122:14:57|C|Har|Casper, could you give us Auto on the High Gain?
122:15:04|T|CMP|Yes, sir. You have Auto.
122:15:58|T|CMP|I tell you, Hank, I think that the terminator got hung up here on a high mountain or something. It doesn't look like it's moving as much as it is everywhere else on the Moon.
122:16:09|C|Har|Roger. Is Davy still in the dark?
122:16:14|T|CMP|Well. I'm not to it yet, but it sure - I don't see anything beyond it. That's a - Hey, old Alphonsus and Arzachel show up nicely. And here comes the crater chain, by golly. Yes, but much to my amazement, but the peak in Albategnius is still - is in daylight.
122:18:04|T|CMP|Oh, I see what's happened now. There's a - there's a little hill that's shielding - I - I see where Davy Crater Chain is now. And it's right in the middle of a big long shadow that's being cast out there. And it's shielding that whole area because Davy and Davy Y show up nicely. And Davy G is easy to see. But the chain itself, I can just make out, and I'll take a picture - well, this is a skewed angle. I don't know if I can get it to show you, buy - they sure must not have much of a lip on them if they don't show. But, by the time we see them, they may be in a fairly high Sun.
121:19:00|C|Har|Roger; copy, Ken.
122:19:07|T|CMP|I'm taking a strip this time, anyhow, because it'll show all the area around Davy. And there are some craters in there - an awful lot of them that have absolutely no rims, which seems to me - it looks entirely different than what you see and what you think of. These things are all very subdued. They just drop in. And you see glows - in the low Sun, you see the - you see the far lip before you see the near lip of the crater. Although there are a few that have raised rims and they - they kind of are the exception here instead of the rule. Whereas most low-Sun-angle places we see are - I'll take a shot down just a little bit to the south there, and there the average is rimmed craters and very few rimless ones.
122:19:56|C|Har|Roger, Ken. And you're about 20 seconds from T-stop on the mapping camera.
122:20:02|T|CMP|Okay. Going to it. Thank you.
122:20:28|T|CMP|Okay; the Mapping Camera is Off. I'll wait 30 seconds.
122:20:20|T|CMP|And, Hank, this system is really good. I don't have to give a second thought to - to what's going on. And just by not having to watch that clock, it just frees your hands to go do everything else that you want to do. It really - on the back side, I get all bent out of shape with myself because I get - I get behind. I start - You just don't have a chance to do anything except those items which are timelined A, B, C and do them in exactly the sequence that they give you.
122:21:11|C|Har|Roger. The only hitch to this is I get interested in what you're saying and I might forget.
122:21:20|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well (laughter), just remember, they go on your card, the back side goes on mine.
122:21:31|C|Har|Actually, though, I got a bunch of guys backing me up.
122:21:38|T|CMP|Well, I tell you, this place is so fascinating that you just - you just don't dare let anything go by. It's - You know, I think you could stay here a lifetime, and never see it all. I guess that's - that's kind of a silly statement because it's true in almost anywhere you go. It sure is dramatic. At first glance, particularly the back side looks like an old gypsum plant. It just looks like someone's poured stuff all over it, and just made it - and just tried to hide it, camouflage things. The more you look at it, then you start to pick out subtle differences. Unfortunately, I'm not smart enough to know what these things mean, but I'm sure that we got some folks down there that certainly do. Maybe if we get enough data, why, they can piece it together.
122:22:39|C|Har|Are you in Standby now with that Mapping Camera, Ken?
122:22:45|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I went to Standby and took the Image Motion, Off.
122:22:48|C|Har|Okay, thank you.
122:22:50|T|CMP|Thank you. I forgot to tell you about it.
122:23:12|T|CMP|Paul, let me give you the reading on magazine SS before I forget it. I'm now at 35.
122:23:18|C|Har|Roger; 35.
122:23:21|T|CMP|And I guess we could - I guess we could sort of say we have filled the - the Davy square. I don't think we ought to keep trying that. Get a chance, why, we will, but I'm not going to keep trying after it.
122:23:59|T|CMP|And the zodiacal light I'll keep on - keep on XX.
122:24:05|C|Har|Roger; XX.
122:26:02|T|CMP|... for 20 seconds ... zodiacal light.
122:26:13|T|CMP|Oh, I'm sorry. I was playing my tape recorder back to myself.
122:28:09|C|Har|Ken, are you free right now?
122:28:17|T|CMP|Say again, Hank.
122:28:19|C|Har|Roger. Are you free right now? Are you doing something?
122:28:24|T|CMP|I'm setting up the camera for the zodiacal light. What do you need?
122:28:29|C|Har|Okay. I was just thinking. In case we lose comm, there is one little change. After we get LOS, where you have to configure the DSE, since we've added then this mapping camera pass - oblique, we want to get High Bit Rate instead of Low Bit Rate.
122:28:48|T|CMP|Okay. Let me write that down. Figuring it says Low, and you want me to go High. Okay; and if you'd remind me of that just before LOS.
122:29:05|C|Har|Roger; intend to - and - in regard to your comments about King, was there any other thing back - on the back side that you had of interest?
122:29:21|T|CMP|I - I found a couple of items back - mostly to the - I think almost all of the things that I had a chance to look at this time were to the - to the west of King. Between there and about AOS, I had a chance to look at the swirls, and to look at King - and a - and a crater - I first felt like I'd found - my first comment was that if there's ever a crater on the Moon that's got stratigraphy exposed, that's got to be it. And I hope that's wrong because there wasn't anywhere I was looking. And I took a picture of that one, and there was another little bright-rayed guy - a little splashed-out crater that looks like so many of the bright-rayed ones, except that it seems like he's built up on a mound. Got this - got this nice mound with this real bright crater in the center of it. And all the bright-rayed material is splashed around it. That too was - that was about south of Fleming, I think - somewhere in that neighborhood.
122:30:30|C|Har|Okay; we'll see if we can locate it.
122:37:08|T|CMP|Hey, Hank.
122:37:11|C|Har|Go ahead.
122:37:14|T|CMP|Would you tell me - confirm how many frames are on the magazine XX. Is it 70, total?
122:37:24|C|Har|Stand by.
122:38:21|C|Har|Ken, should be 48 total frames on the mag, and we show you 42 remaining.
122:38:36|T|CMP|Forty-eight total. Okay.
122:38:50|T|CMP|Okay; so I can take eight frames on this thing and still have plenty for the zodiacal light?
122:39:20|C|Har|That's correct, Ken.
122:39:24|T|CMP|Okay; there's one. This stuff isn't - just isn't as bright as it was even yesterday of - The first night it was really something.
122:39:46|T|CMP|There's number 2. And number 2 was not a part of a strip, but rather an interesting graben that runs through a crater. And I'm coming up on - I believe this is Grimaldi.
122:40:04|C|Har|Roger. We show you north of Grimaldi.
122:40:24|T|CMP|Why, that's where I recognized that - that double crater feature. Let's see -
122:40:41|T|CMP|You're right, I'm west. It's Riccioli.
122:40:49|C|Har|Can you see Riccioli C? That looks like in the map a double - a double-ring crater.
122:40:56|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That's the one I thought was north of Grimaldi, and that's what I'm looking at here. Okay; this is the area where - I don't know if I can get a photo of the things I saw last night that were really interesting. They had some - it's not as bright - not sure I can see it all. Yeah, there it is. I don't know if this is gonna.
122:41:31|T|CMP|Okay, my third one here in this sequence was taken off the - of the crossed grabens in Grimaldi. And, as I commented before, when you look out in the dark, you get a very dramatic terminator, just like you do from the earthshine, just like you do from the - ... shine. And there's a place - I'll try to get a picture of this, because it shows - there's this bright thing on the horizon, which is obviously a big mountain chain and I would - It sticks up quite a number of degrees above the horizon. Okay; I guess that's - that's all I'm gonna try to take in this sequence and I'll get back to the - I'll take one up to the north here. There's some more interesting things. We'll still be safe.
122:42:54|T|CMP|Okay; okay, I'm now on frame 13. So that was frames whatever we had before up through 13. And I'm going back now to the zodiacal light configuration.
122:44:51|T|CMP|Sure do get some interesting sensations when you try to float around in a dark cockpit here, and you run into a camera or something, and you try to figure out what it was that just tapped you on the back.
122:45:01|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger.
122:45:17|T|CMP|Okay; we're in configuration for zodiacal light.
122:45:33|T|CMP|Did you want me to do this at 123:05, on time? Is that correct?
122:45:40|C|Har|Ken, I guess you just don't start earlier than that.
122:45:47|T|CMP|I'm talking about the DSE now.
122:46:19|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Configure the DSE at 123:06.
122:46:26|T|CMP|123:06, okay.
122:46:37|C|Har|I guess you can do that, and then start your zodiacal light any time after that.
122:46:45|T|CMP|The zodiacal light has to start on this PAD time, I think.
122:46:51|C|Har|You're correct.
122:47:13|T|CMP|Heys Hank, if you run into Plenty [?] around there somewhere, you might tell him that - ask him to tell Stoner and Temple that all those hours they put in configuring the CMS so that it'd have the right stowage and all the little goodies'd be in place, has certainly paid off. Man, I can run around, and I can reach for things and get it all done without - without feeling like I'm pressed for time. And it's thanks to their keeping that thing in flight configuration.
122:47:42|C|Har|Okay. I'll relate that, Ken.
122:49:40|C|Har|Casper, Houston. You're looking good at LOS, and you got about a minute to go. Don't forget your DSE.
122:49:48|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much. See you in about 40.
122:49:51|C|Har|Roger.
123:38:56|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
123:39:02|T|CMP|Hello there.
123:39:03|C|Har|Hello. How'd it go on that rev?
123:39:10|T|CMP|Well, that's right interesting. On the zodiacal light, I got it done and took the last frame just as the Sun - I took the frame and it said stop the tape and the Sun came up. So, I guess that all worked out pretty good. In the process, I missed the settings for a quarter of a second and possibly one of them for a half because when I turned the filter, it came off. And I figured there wasn't any sense in taking it with the filter in other than its 90-degree positions. But the rest of the stuff - managed to get done on time and we rolled out at 31:09 and turned the Mapping Camera, On, at 31:09. So, you missed about six seconds.
123:40:00|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
123:40:03|T|CMP|I guess the - it was - maybe that was - maybe I made it. It was right close - yeah, 31:12 was when you wanted it. That was a tight maneuver.
123:40:34|C|Har|Ken, you have your 9 Charlie handy?
123:41:01|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Go ahead.
123:41:02|C|Har|Okay. Our best guess for the LM is at coordinates 80 and Charlie Alfa 0.7. That's about 200 meters northwest of Double Spot.
123:41:23|T|CMP|Okay. That's 80 and Charlie Alfa 0.7.
123:41:28|C|Har|That's affirmative.
123:41:36|T|CMP|Okay. We'll go take a look.
123:41:42|C|Har|And, I do have one other Flight Plan change for you.
123:41:45|T|CMP|Thank you very much.
123:41:53|C|Har|That occurs at 126:44.
123:41:54|T|CMP|All righty.
123:42:15|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
123:42:16|C|Har|Okay. You know we told you earlier we didn't really want to play around with that mass spec boom. So, we want to delete the "Mass spec retract to 8.4 feet.
123:42:29|T|CMP|Okay, that's deleted.
123:42:31|C|Har|And, at 1 - 128:29, since we didn't pull it back , we don't need to deploy it again. We can delete the "Mass spec deploy.
123:43:12|T|CMP|Hank, are you still there?
123:43:14|C|Har|Roger. Did you copy that last?
123:43:19|T|CMP|No, you just stopped talking it sounded like.
123:43:22|C|Har|Oh - okay -
123:43:23|T|CMP|You want me to delete the boom retraction.
123:43:27|C|Har|Okay, at 128:29, there - delete "Mass spec deploy.
123:43:42|T|CMP|Okay, that's because it is already out.
123:43:45|C|Har|That's affirmative.
123:43:50|C|Har|And, Ken, your biomed data looks good now and I guess that's about all I got for you at AOS. Did you see anything on this last back side that is worthy of comment?
123:44:03|T|CMP|Ah - yeah. Around Mandel'shtam, I was looking at some interesting flow features. And, again, I am using the flow feature - that's the kind of appearance it has - not that's what it is. And, right at AOS - oh, maybe 3 minutes after AOS - I mean IDS -
123:47:31|T|CMP|Hank, right now I am looking at - coming on across Smythii and I'm looking at some features there that - up on one of the - of the subdued filled-in craters that we see on the northern edge - I - well, it's out - out of where I can reach it now, what I - what I was looking at was a crater that's - all subdued and typical of those features in Smythii. It had an outer ring and I think probably the crater I was looking at is the one that's about -
123:48:25|C|Har|Hit Auto in the High Gain, Casper, when you get a chance.
123:48:31|T|CMP|Okay, you've got Auto. I guess the one I was looking at is the one that's on the map about 85 degrees - no, make that about 84 degrees east and about 2 degrees south - There's a large one there. And on the northeast side of it, there is a little bright-rayed crater that I - first caught my eye. And, then there's an arcuate pattern that goes with it that's concentric to this large crater. And this bright crater is right at the head of it. This concentric material is a very light color - and if it were in a straight line, you would say it was ray material. It's possible - it doesn't look like a raised rim like the other rims on the concentric crater on the big basin. However, it looks like this little bright-rayed crater is right at the head of it. And it is - the bright-rayed crater appears to be domed up in just a slight rise and then this bright crater in top of it. And then what looks like this other ring, which is concentric to the big crater. We ought to have that on pan stuff, so I won't worry about it. Because it is almost directly into the ground track.
123:50:07|C|Har|Roger. Can you see Neper from there?
123:50:13|T|CMP|Not now. I probably could have then.
123:50:26|C|Har|How far to the - either side of the ground track do you think you can adequately see?
123:50:35|T|CMP|Not very far. These windows really - You're really restricted. Let me see if I can give you a gouge here.
123:50:44|C|Har|I was just curious. We are going to be coming by La Perouse and Kapteyn here shortly and I just wondered if you could get a look at their central features.
123:50:52|T|CMP|Yeah. I know you can't see - Oh, I'm almost positive you can't see that far.
123:51:26|T|CMP|We're flying - what a - north - south of Blagg right now, right? So, that means my window number 3 is straight down.
123:51:37|C|Har|That's affirmative.
123:52:15|T|CMP|Okay, I've got - ol' La Perouse and Ansgarius.
123:52:29|T|CMP|Well, wait a minute - maybe not.
123:52:42|T|CMP|Okay, I can see La Perouse. I missed him. I got out here a little bit too late.
123:42:58|T|CMP|I should be looking at the two I was always getting confused here. And, that - must be getting pretty close to a subsolar point, because the terrain features are really hard to distinguish. I do see Kapteyn and Langrenus A. And the central feature in Langrenus A is more obvious than the one in Kapteyn from the Sun angle.
123:53:41|C|Har|You just passed the subsolar point, Ken, about three or four minutes ago.
123:53:48|T|CMP|Yeah, it's pretty hard to see things, although I guess I'm equally impressed with how much you can see in - certainly see a lot more than these photographs have shown us.
123:54:05|C|Har|You are over the Maclaurin series now.
123:54:16|T|CMP|Yeah, I have trouble with them up here just like I did in school.
123:55:32|T|CMP|Okay, I am looking at the central peaks in Langrenus and you can see blocks with the telescope here.
123:55:51|T|CMP|There's actually some fairly large ones on the - on the western slopes of the eastern part of the horseshoe. And there appear to be an awful lot of them in the little alluvium fan that appears to be out to the south.
123:56:43|T|CMP|And, I am trying to look at some of those dark patches that are in the southern walls. They look like flat dark blobs of material that are in - along the terraced material. And I really can't make out a great deal. Terraces in this area are - are extremely wide and fairly steep . And the walls here look relatively steep compared to the other walls around the Moon.
123:58:11|T|CMP|This is really a nice attitude for viewing things. I can see Petavius and it stacks up - great big central peak - I think that's Petavius because Petavius B is down there.
124:00:37|T|CMP|Okay, I am looking at Messier and Messier A and they're - around the elongate of the two, there doesn't appear to be anything you can pick up with binoculars except it looks kind of mottled. The interiors slope like all the rest. The interior didn't look particularly different - on - the rounded one, it looks like there is a resistant - several resistant layers in the sides, and I'll get a picture of those. In fact. they're standing out. And, it does look like there is a connection between the two craters. Some subtle thing that comes out in the direction of the tails and, then as you come out to the west, there's some darker material that runs out and looks smooth and stands out and comes out into the mare and it - almost looks like dark material might be - might be - might be a result of the crater although I'm sure that the white - the light streaks on the - are the things that are supposed to be coming out -
124:02:13|T|CMP|It does appear to be, though, that when I look at the - I've got a place now where I can see the light tail and the - and the regular mare together and I got a picture of that. That's frame number 14 [AS16-120-19196] on magazine Victor. And that - It looks to me like there is a higher crater count of large craters in the light-rayed material than there is in the darker material.
124:02:47|C|Har|Say that again, Ken, about the crater count.
122:02:52|T|CMP|It looks like it's higher in the light-rayed material than it is in the darker stuff, which is, I guess, what you would anticipate.
124:03:21|T|CMP|If you are a fan of bright-rayed craters, frame number 15 [AS16-120-19197] is one of those, just coming up on - oh, lost my place.
124:03:55|T|CMP|Yeah, it's about halfway between - oh, the beginning of the highlands - Gutenberg Highlands, and - where Censorinus is.
124:04:13|C|Har|Roger.
124:05:01|T|CMP|And, Hank, at this higher Sun angle now when we get down here and we look at this place where the - where we're talking about the bright rays that seem to take a Funny shape between Midler and a little crater out to the east of him. It's not real obvious now that there is anything more than some bright material in between it.
124:05:25|C|Har|Roger.
124:05:43|T|CMP|I'll tell you, these Sun angles really can play tricks on you, and I'm looking at Midler now, and I got a real good view of him. And we discussed the possibility of having material come in from the north and run down inside of him. And it's not that obvious when you look down on him from here. There's material that runs over - you see a little high. As you look down inside, you see light and dark material, the same kind of combination you see in other craters. With the naked eye, it looks very much like - there's an expression that says that this ridge to the north ran down inside there and formed that little tongue. But when you look at it in blown-up detail, you see some vertical - well, now I can see places where I can see a flow pattern that's run down in. And, as a matter of fact, I'll get a picture real fast [AS16-120-19198]. Hope that gets it.
124:06:42|C|Har|Do you think that - just looking at a map here - do you think that what you're seeing could be an expression of the rim of Nectaris?
124:06:52|T|CMP|No. No, I sure don't because this has a nice margin, and it curves down in and rolls down as though it had - it starts where there's a little terrace - a little - looks like part of a cratered terrace. And it runs down inside and it runs out and forms that central feature, and it runs down on the floor. And it certainly appears that it came and rolled down on there after the crater and all its slump features were already there. We'll have to come back to the question of its relation to Theophilus.
124:07:26|C|Har|Roger.
124:09:20|C|Har|Ken, for your information, John and Charlie are at Flag now.
124:09:29|T|CMP|Okay, I'll wave to them. I'll tell you, NASA needs to recruit some octopuses. I could really use a couple of more hands.
124:09:45|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger.
124:10:13|T|CMP|Okay, I'm going to concentrate on North Ray as I distinctly believe that the - area that the traverse drawn on that goes up on the North Ray comes up on a - material that looks like it has flowed around and is part of the basic furrowed Descartes unit that's mapped back further to the east. And it looks to me like it runs down around the crater and - and straight into it.
124:11:04|T|CMP|I can see evidence of stratigraphy in North Ray, and lots of it in South Ray. And as we come across at - boy, I'll tell you, the - the general topography down there looks about the same all the way across the board.
124:13:57|T|CMP|And just at a cursory glance, we're coming up on Albategnius now and that material that's over to the east of it - that kind of hummocky and undulating material and it's furrowed. And it looks very much like the material around Descartes. I said it did in a very low Sun, and it has the appearance of having many of those same characteristics.
124:14:55|C|Har|Have you got pretty good shadows in this area now, Ken?
124:15:01|T|CMP|The shadows are right here coming across Albategnius. They're pretty well cleared out. You just get the shadows from the very big peaks. At Ptolemaeus, it's almost completely clear of shadows. Alphonsus still has some. I can pick out the crater chain now. It's just now getting out of the shadow, and, sure enough, there is a great big little ridge that lays across the front of it that's been masking it all this time. The floor of Ptolemaeus looks to be like all the rest of the Cayley material. It's got a great deal of craters as you can see from the pictures. I would say the preponderance of them are rimless. As they get a little larger, they start to form with a - very - a very subtle rim, so I guess I can't say that they're all rimless. There is one, looks like a fracture, about in the middle, and it may be a scarp that's caused by a fracture, or it may be a flow pattern.
124:16:51|T|CMP|And as we come upon Davy chain, it appears that they do have - they don't each have an individual rim. There is mottled material in this area, and I'm going to try and get that magazine. I think you need to see this. Can you give me the settings for the - so we can take a picture of this real fast.
124:17:18|C|Har|Stand by.
124:17:33|T|CMP|Using VHBW.
124:17:42|C|Har|Okay. I'll - we see if we can get them, Ken.
124:17:47|T|CMP|Okay. I'm going to take one here now at - that was 5.6 and t/125 I'll take a 250th. Second one's a 250th. And that ought to bracket it, I hope. And that's of the crater chain itself. And it just - it appears that they're essentially rimless, but the whole area down there is kind of mottled.
124:18:16|C|Har|Roger. Did you use the EL for that?
124:18:17|T|CMP|It's a very pretty scarp. No, I used VHBW.
124:18:51|C|Har|Casper, Houston. You're coming up in about 20 seconds to a T-stop.
124:18:53|T|CMP|I sure am. Okay. Thank you. Give me a call at T-stop.
124:19:12|C|Har|Mark it; T-stop.
124:19:17|T|CMP|Okay. We're at T-stop. Thank you.
124:19:32|T|CMP|Okay, that's - We're now in frame 36 on magazine SS.
124:19:50|C|Har|Okay. You can go - Standby on a Mapping Camera and Image Motion, Off.
124:20:00|T|CMP|Okay. Standby and Image Motion, Off. Barber pole - gray.
124:20:21|T|CMP|It's very interesting, Hank. I've got a little stranger back here that's trailing me. Must be one of Casper's friends.
124:20:29|C|Har|All righty. We'll -
124:20:30|T|CMP|Got a little light's just sitting out there. I guess he's - I have no idea how far away it is, you know, though - I have the impression it's like ten feet, but it could be 100 feet or 1000 feet. But it's apparently some little particle that's in orbit with me, and it's - it's probably rotating, because it's winking. I first saw these last night, and I thought I'd seen something on the ground. Then I realized I'd - it was moving at the same rate I was and every now and then I look out and I see these particles that are reflecting around me.
124:21:07|C|Har|If you see a blue one winking, you'd better pull over.
124:21:10|T|CMP|Mass spec guys might be interested. (Laughter) Yeah, if I hear someone say, "Beep, beep," I'll wake the SPS or something.
124:21:28|T|CMP|The mass spec guys might be interested in that though.
124:21:32|C|Har|Okay. They're listening.
124:23:48|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
124:23:53|T|CMP|Go ahead.
124:23:54|C|Har|Roger. To make up some of the SIM Bay data we lost here, we'd like to make a real-time change here, since we've got to maneuver over to the north oblique here in about 40 minutes or so. We'd just like to now make a maneuver to plus-X SIM Bay, and we'll take SIM Bay data until you have to roll on over to the north oblique.
124:24:21|T|CMP|I understand you'd like for me to go to plus-X forward SIM Bay attitude now.
124:24:26|C|Har|That's affirmative.
124:24:32|T|CMP|Okay. I can do that and eat at the same time.
124:25:36|T|CMP|Henry, I understand you want me to go to the north oblique photo attitude.
124:25:40|C|Har|Negative. Now we just want you to go to the plus-X SIM Bay.
124:25:43|T|CMP|Or just to the - Okay, fine.
124:29:10|C|Har|You playing music, Ken?
124:29:14|T|CMP|Yes, sir. How do you like Mahler from space?
124:29:19|C|Har|Sounds all right.
124:29:21|T|CMP|I know you don't like him even - you don't even like him at home. I'll tell you, this has got to be absolutely sinful - too much fun to be ...
124:30:09|C|Har|Okay. I see you're at attitude.
124:30:18|T|CMP|Hey, thank you. Good call. That'll keep me from having to do it again.
124:30:27|C|Har|And, Ken, to fill you in, what we're after is to get as much of the SIM Bay data as we can, since we missed some of it. The alpha part[icle] especially needs a lot of it, and - if you've got you Flight Plan in front of you, at - at 125:15, we are supposed to now - then move over to the 40 degrees north oblique. FAO says that maneuver takes a maximum of three minutes. So if you could delay starting that until whatever you figure is a reasonable time before the mapping camera T-start, then we can - we can get a pretty good slug of data in there.
124:31:08|T|CMP|Okay. Be glad to do that. How's our little laser coming along? Is it doing any better or any worse? I guess we haven't had it on since you gave me your report, though.
124:31:38|C|Har|It's still toddling, Ken. I guess when we get it back running again, we'll be getting about 80 percent with it.
124:31:49|T|CMP|Okay. Is that latter [laser?] network working, or has it got a different problem?
124:31:54|C|Har|It's working okay, Ken.
124:33:03|T|CMP|Hank, can I give you some comments that are not really pertinent to anything we're doing, but little observations that I had a chance to make, and I'm afraid I'll forget them. I got too many things stored up in my head now.
124:33:18|C|Har|Okay. Go ahead.
124:33:19|T|CMP|But - one of - one of the things, I was just sitting here looking at the equipment and some of the things that have caused more interest than others in what we were doing. And - one of the things that is at the heart of a lot of your time in this spacecraft is fixing something to eat. Now, I'm - without discussing whether or not you need to eat this much, just the idea that if you try to eat part of it, it takes an awful long time to fix each of these things. And one of the big hang-ups is we all get clustered around the water gun. We've talked about gas coming out of the water gun, and this is not the drink port, but the food-preparation station. And the - if you - one of the ways we found we could induce gas bubbles into the waker was by depressing the plunger before it had had a chance to complete its stroke. If you let it complete its stroke, it seems to give you a nice, relatively gas-free shot of water. And it looks like the hot water gives you more for an ounce than the cold water does. But if you're very meticulous about waiting until you're sure that the plunger has made its full travel, and then count to ten or something before you push it again, the cold water isn't quite as short as it looks like it is. And I don't really know how to explain why we have gas bubbles sometimes and why we don't. It's almost as though the gas separator may not affect the problem. We started out and the first couple of days we didn't have any gas. I guess about two days. Then on the third day, we started getting gas in the hot water and we were getting like 50 percent gas. We tried the cigar gas separator, and that - that - after we got it flushed out the first time, seemed to work pretty well. And then it started getting gas, so we decided to try the prototype model. Then when we put it on the feed station - why, as soon as we put it on, why, we made a squirt and nothing came out, and we decided to try it again. And by then, it was obvious that it was building up pressure inside, and the food station was putting out water, and it wasn't coming out the other end. And we never did get water to come out the - the outlet side of the new gas separator. And it looks like it has a crack in the top on the inlet side, and the gas - the water was bubbling out of that. It was coming out under pressure. When we took the thing off, why, you could tell that the check valve or something, had never been opened. So we really don't know whether that thing has an effective use or not. And it - it seems like the more water you use, the more gas you get. I don't - I'm not sure I completely understand that. You get more gas in the hot water than you do in the cold water. But the water I've been getting out today and yesterday has been almost gas-free spin it up here, and I won't get - I get a zone of less than ten percent gas. And that's ten percent of a seven-ounce food - juice bag. The other day we were getting 50 percent. And I really can't psych out exactly all the causes for it. The cigar food - cigar dispenser there has some problems of its own. And every time you get through with it, it dribbles. And it will dribble for quite a while. But I found out if you put the little cap on it right away, then it quits dribbling. And it's only that initial dribble, and the rest of it from there on is easy. I really don't expect anything to be done with these comments. I just want to - we're supposed to evaluate these things, Hank. And rather than write them down - it's a lot easier to put here, and I'll get it off the tape after the flight.
124:37:56|C|Har|Okay. I took notes there on most of that.
124:38:01|T|CMP|Okay. I'm sorry. I should have told you first. I really wasn't anticipating you having to copy all that. I'm kind of rambling and being verbose. But I can see that I'm not going to get everything I see written down and probably ought to go ahead and get it jotted down some way.
124:39:37|C|Har|Ken, it looks like the next action in the Flight Plan for you is around 125:13 where it says "GDC align." I think we've scratched out everything ahead of that.
124:40:01|T|CMP|Okay. I'm taking advantage of that to get a little eating done, and maybe we can have a chance to look at the backside this time.
124:40:08|C|Har|Okay.
124:44:24|T|CMP|Hank, there's one other thing I'd like to comment on before I forget it.
124:44:29|C|Har|Go ahead.
124:44:33|T|CMP|That's the cockpit temperature. I've been noticing a little gauge, and it (laughter) - it doesn't ever move. I think it's got a - I think it's plugged into a dummy load somewhere. But the cockpit temperature does, in fact, change quite a bit. And on the way out, in PTC with the three of us in here, it never really got cool enough even for people as warmblooded as Charlie and I. And we were wondering, you know, gee, if it was like that in PTC, what was it going to he like when we got in orbit. And the first day in orbit there, it was - it really was kind of hot and stuffy. And I don't know when it got cool, but last night it was nice and cool. And, in fact, I woke up this morning because I was cold. That was the reason I woke up. And in the past, I've had a hard time sleeping sometimes, because it was warm. I don't know whether that's a - that's caused by going to the 60-circular orbit, or whether that's caused by having only one body to take care of in here, instead of three. But it was very obvious. Unfortunately, we'd get a chance to - I couldn't tell you yesterday. I was wearing a suit, and so it was never really comfortable most of the day. Maybe when John and Charlie get back, we'll notice again, and see if it gets hot again.
124:49:29|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS, and everything's looking good from this end.
124:49:41|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. You're cutting out; I understand.
125:42:22|T|CMP|Hello, Houston. Are you there today?
125:42:25|C|Har|Hello, Casper. How did it go?
125:42:30|T|CMP|Just fine. Having a ball. Got all kinds of neat little things seen on the - this last rev. Had a chance to start watching right of the terminator and just kind of watched the scenery as it came by in AOS. And I think I did wonders for the magnification of these binoculars by cleaning the lens. I had about given up on them, decided that they weren't as good as I thought they were. Until I found out that one side had somebody's big greasy thumbprint on it. Somebody probably being me.
125:43:07|C|Har|Roger.
125:43:15|T|CMP|And, right now, on magazine Victor, I am up to frame 37.
125:43:28|C|Har|Roger. Victor, frame 37. And, Ken, I've got some pads for you.
125:43:35|T|CMP|Okay. Let me get my pencil and paper.
125:43:40|C|Har|First one's at 126:20, UV Photo Pad.
125:43:48|T|CMP|Okay, hang on a second. Let me get everything velcroed down.
125:44:01|T|CMP|Okay. Say again the time, please, Hank.
125:44:04|C|Har|126:20.
125:44:12|T|CMP|Okay. 126:20. All righty.
125:44:19|C|Har|Okay. T-start is 126:19:26.
125:44:29|T|CMP|Okay. 126:19:26.
125:44:33|C|Har|And just for info. Somewhere around 126:35, we're going to get you a state vector update. The next pad time is at 127:18.
125:44:46|T|CMP|Okay, 127:18; go ahead.
125:44:49|C|Har|Your Gamma Ray deploy time to 15 inches is 14 seconds.
125:44:57|T|CMP|Okay, that will be 14 seconds.
125:45:00|C|Har|And your T-start for your Pan - Mapping Camera Pad right there is 127:27:58; T-stop, 130:28:19.
125:45:18|T|CMP|Okay, 127:27:58, 130:28:19.
125:45:23|C|Har|Okay, and the Pan Camera Pad at 128:13.
125:45:31|T|CMP|Okay, stand by a second.
125:46:20|T|CMP|Okay. What's the next one now - at 128:10, you say?
125:46:24|C|Har|Well - Roger. 128:13 there, the Pan Camera Photo Pad.
125:46:32|T|CMP|Go ahead.
125:46:33|C|Har|T-start is 128:19:09, 128:20:47.
125:46:48|T|CMP|Okay, 128:19:09, 128:20:47.
125:46:56|C|Har|Okay, that's about all the pads. You say you saw some interesting things on the back side, huh?
125:47:07|T|CMP|Yeah, the real Moon is just like photos - the more you look, the more you see. You'll be happy to know, though, that, until you get used to it, the craters on the real Moon can turn inside out just like they do on (laughter) on the photographs.
125:47:24|C|Har|Really?
125:47:25|T|CMP|It's very frustrating.
125:47:34|T|CMP|And it's not always clear which way to turn to - to turn them over.
125:47:40|C|Har|Roger; I understand. Hey, I got a little poop on - some of the gamma ray results, if you're interested - in case you're interested in doing some sort of global observations relative to the color or character of large areas on the Moon. The early gamma ray stuff shows that the highest readings occur in the maria areas in the west, including Nubium, Cognitum, and Procellarum. The next highest are in the central highlands from -
125:48:08|T|CMP|Okay, just a second now. The highest stuff is in the mares [sic] - to best -
125:48:18|C|Har|Roger. In the west -
125:48:20|T|CMP|- Cognitum, Nubium, and so on.
125:48:23|C|Har|Right. And the next highest - is in the central highlands from Midler to Alphonsus.
125:48:36|T|CMP|Okay, the - you say the highest readings - highest of - of what? Just - just the highest counts?
125:48:43|C|Har|I guess just the highest - highest counting rates in the Gamma Spectrometer.
125:48:53|T|CMP|Okay.
125:48:54|C|Har|Third highest is Mare Fecunditatis area. And the lowest readings occur in - on the far-side highlands.
125:49:14|T|CMP|Well, I can't - I can tell you they sure look different. They're all black over there. That's always intriguing, when you can't see something.
125:51:02|C|Har|And, Ken, these light-colored markings you reported near King Crater - the west of King? Farouk says those are near the crater Abul Wafa. And these may be similar to the swirls of Ibn Yunus, but they are not identical. And for your information, the markings of Abul Wafa are - he uses the term antipodal or opposite to Riccioli, on the western part of your track.
125:51:32|T|CMP|(Laughter)
125:51:34|C|Har|That means it's 180 degrees from there.
125:51:36|T|CMP|Tell him that it - it's awfully - Roger; Roger. Tell him it's awful hard to find a place where there - 180 degrees away - there won't be a crater on the Moon.
125:51:45|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger.
125:51:48|T|CMP|He'll understand.
125:51:54|C|Har|Casper, High Gain on the Auto - Auto on the High Gain.
125:52:00|T|CMP|Sure can.
125:52:21|T|CMP|I got one that's better for him this time, though. I'm not at all sure that those swirls that I saw north of - northwest of King are - are really - like the others or not. I - I tried to get a look at Ibn Yunus this time, and it's still a little too far to the north.
125:55:19|T|CMP|You know, Henry, one of the things that impresses me is that when you look at the mare surface in very high Sun, like I'm doing now, a lot of the very shallow craters that have just very subtle, sweeping walls and are together maybe in a chain or in groups - when you see this at high Sun, it looks exactly like a swirl pattern. If you didn't know that's what it was, you'd - you probably would wonder about it also.
125:55:49|C|Har|Roger.
125:57:06|T|CMP|And, Hank, would you give me a warning about 126:18 ?
125:57:11|C|Har|Will do.
125:58:27|T|CMP|Hank, looking in the bottom floor of Messier - I think it's the original Messier, the elongate one - the bottom dark material has a little ropey white material that runs down the length of the crater. And at one end, it looks like - sort of like a high-water mark. On the northern - northern and western end of that, it looks like there had been a high-water mark and then maybe this stuff had dropped down. And you see little blocks of that stuff, kind of like the whole thing had just been floating and it had just sunk a little bit.
125:59:28|T|CMP|When I look in the wall of the other one - the round one - it appears that there's a depression in the northwest side where it's kind of pushed in and things may have run down in there. I have the distinct impression that there was an original crater that is not part of the bright one that we see now that's over on the western side.
126:00:29|T|CMP|Yes, as a matter of fact, Messier A does show a secondary crater. And I have the impression that that was an old crater that kind of smoothed and darkened and looked like the rest of these older craters, and that it - Messier A then was penetrated on top of that, or at least formed subsequent to that, and it kind of broke into that wall.
126:00:42|C|Har|Roger. The map shows an indication maybe there might be a secondary there.
126:00:48|T|CMP|Yeah, it - I had thought maybe that was a - a terrace - kind of like a slump feature, but apparently that's not the case.
126:01:31|T|CMP|I wish we had some low-Sun pictures of this crater that had the bright splash rays that I took a picture of before, that's about halfway between Messier and Censorinus. I'd swear it's on the top of a - a very shallow rise. And it - appears to me that there is a very slightly darker albedo to the material underneath it - That goes out about the same diameter as the bright rays. Now, it may be that the bright rays are giving it that characteristic just because they're - they may be tenuous enough that they don't show up by themselves, but they may be there.
126:02:32|T|CMP|There's another one a little smaller that's about halfway between the one I just described and Censorinus. And if there's one that I'd agree with Stu has black things that drape down inside it - like that might, but maybe when I get closer, it'll look like shadows. It's kind of hard to tell from here. There are an awful lot of blocks around it, it appears.
126:03:22|T|CMP|I'm looking now at this bright, depressed crater that's next to it, and I'm going to try to get a picture of that next time I get the camera available because this white stuff runs down the side of a very smooth brown crater. And there's places where you can see it's run out on the floor on the bottom, and it has a very strange appearance. It - it - The white stuff looks like it ran out and then just stopped abruptly. There's no - no toe on it or anything.
126:06:36|C|Har|Casper, Houston. About a minute to go for your UV.
126:06:42|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, sir.
126:07:29|C|Har|And, Ken, you don't have to acknowledge, but John and Charlie just got back into the LM, and they're just repressurized.
126:07:44|T|CMP|Okay. I show that we're at the time to do this; however, it looks like we're not up to Descartes yet, and the camera's pointing - along towards Kant.
126:07:59|C|Har|Okay. The Flight Plan calls for leading it about two minutes, Ken.
126:07:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 126 hours 21 minutes [plan GET, 126:10 actual GET], and we've just had a report - a further report on Ken Mattingly and Casper. Everything continues to go very well. Flight Director Donald Puddy, who is following the actions of the Command and Service Module, said that they have not missed a thing in the Flight Plan. Everything is going very well.

126:10:15|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I got it done, but I guess I made one mistake there. I didn't get the engines off. I didn't hear any firings during the time that I was taking the pictures, but I didn't get to Free.
126:10:27|C|Har|Roger.
126:10:38|C|Har|And, Ken, the guys are back inside. I don't know whether you heard me a while ago or not, but EVA-1 was a total success. They had a seven hour and 11 minute EVA.
126:10:49|T|CMP|Outstanding. Did they have anything particularly significant to say or -
126:11:01|C|Har|I didn't catch all of it, let me ask -
126:11:02|T|CMP|Did they have any surprises in the things they saw or that they didn't expect?
126:11:30|C|Har|I guess the big thing, Ken, was they found all breccia. They found only one rock that possibly might be igneous.
126:11:40|T|CMP|Is that right? (Laughter)
126:11:45|C|Har|Yeah. I guess the guys are a little bit surprised by that.
126:11:46|T|CMP|Well, that ought to- that ought to call for a session with the - (laughter) yeah, yeah (laughter). Well, it's back to the drawing boards or wherever geologists go.
126:12:13|C|Har|Hey, Ken. Ron's asking what you were wearing last night when you got cold.
126:12:23|T|CMP|I was just sleeping in my sleeping bag. I mean - All I had to do was get up and put on my - my jacket and trousers. Up to then, just getting in the sleeping bag was almost too hot.
126:12:40|C|Har|Roger.
126:12:49|T|CMP|Okay, we're at frame 60 on magazine OO.
126:16:50|T|CMP|Okay. I've got a real good look at the Davy chain now, and they are definitely all rimless. There are some - they run kind of northeast - southwest, and there are a couple of very subtle constructional features that just look like little - little bubbles of material that run north and south. They cross the ch - crater chain, but in fact, when they cross it, it kind of breaks it up. But the - the craters in the chain themselves don't look like they have any rims at all.
126:17:48|C|Har|And, Casper; Houston. You're coming up on about 15 seconds to T-stop for the mapping camera.
126:17:57|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
126:17:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 126 hours 28 minutes [plan GET, 126:17 actual GET].

126:18:11|T|CMP|And the Mapping Camera is Off.
126:19:13|C|Har|And, Ken, have you done the rest of the things there?
126:19:19|T|CMP|I'm coming up to it now. Thank you. Going to Standby, and Image Motion, Off, and it's barber pole - and gray. And here comes the gamma ray shield. Shield is Off now.
126:19:55|C|Har|And if you'll give us Accept, we'll up-link a state vector.
126:20:02|T|CMP|Okay, you've got her.
126:21:59|C|Har|Casper, the computer's yours.
126:22:04|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
126:22:48|T|CMP|Okay, and I'm taking magazine XX out of the 35, and I'm going after magazine ZZ.
126:22:58|C|Har|Okay.
126:30:18|T|CMP|Hank, you know I mentioned to you yesterday that old GDC was really hanging in there, and I think it's drifted less today than it has before.
126:30:32|C|Har|Hey, that's just fantastic. I never saw one in the simulator like that.
126:30:40|T|CMP|Oh, we - we asked them to put in big drifts so we wouldn't get in the habit of trusting it, you know, without keeping in mind you got to keep dressing it up. And, so help me, this thing - I'm gonna run you a drift check here, when I get through with this maneuver. But I'll bet you that it's, you know, one degree an hour in roll is about it.
126:31:57|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Can you terminate the Bat B charge ?
126:32:03|T|CMP|Sure can. And it's off.
126:32:08|C|Har|Okay, and we want to get Gamma Ray shield, on.
126:32:16|T|CMP|Okay, the Gamma Ray shield is coming on, now.
126:39:32|C|Har|Casper, Omni Delta.
126:39:38|T|CMP|Oh, you're already on Omni Delta.
126:39:40|C|Har|Boy, it sure sounds bad.
126:39:45|T|CMP|Yeah, it does. Anything else go with that, Hank?
126:39:54|C|Har|Say again.
126:39:58|T|CMP|Does anything else go with that?
126:40:47|T|CMP|Hank, do you read me at all?
126:40:48|C|Har|Roger, Ken; I'm reading you.
126:40:54|T|CMP|Oh, okay. I just wondered. I got a lot of noise, but I hear you loud and clear whenever you talk.
126:40:58|C|Har|Roger. Same here.
126:41:14|T|CMP|Any word on how the LM consumables are looking, or is it too soon to tell?
126:41:21|C|Har|I haven't heard anything yet, Ken.
126:41:29|T|CMP|Have they said anything about which - if they only run one more EVA, which one they'll run?
126:41:38|C|Har|Stand by.
126:42:14|C|Har|Ken, they're still looking at whether we've got enough consumables or not. However, tomorrow they're going to proceed with EVA-2.
126:42:25|T|CMP|Okay.
126:44:20|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We've got just a few minutes here to LOS, and everything looks good from this end. We'll probably do a shift change in here while - during LOS. Stu will come on, and I'll see you in the morning. A last reminder to configure your DSE at 127:01.
126:44:43|T|CMP|Okay. At 127:01, I get a High Bit Rate and Command Reset. Okay, thanks a lot, Hank, you've been a big help today. See you in the morning.

127:36:45|C|Roo|Casper, Houston; standing by.
127:36:54|T|CMP|Roger, Stu. Be with you in just a minute, soon as I find out where I am here. I just took a picture; now I don't know how to tell you where I am. It's really bad when you switch from window to window, trying to figure out where some of these things go to.
127:37:54|T|CMP|Okay. Stu, I'm - I don't - I don't think we've got any - any open items.
127:38:06|C|Roo|No, we're - we're pretty clean here. I've got a correction for you as you look at the landing site again, but that can wait until after you finish with Kapteyn here and so forth.
127:38:20|T|CMP|Okay. That's probably a good idea. I've got a pretty low saturation level.- I've - I got a good look at the - both the Saxd [?] and at your bright ray on Chaplygin on this last pass. And I really don't know what to make of all that. That - you're right about the location of that bright ray on Chaplygin. So I guess you win on that one. The thing that I thought was rather intriguing about that was that there are all kinds of big blocks all around the outside of it, and all around on the inside too. And yet it looks like a great big mud pie. I really don't - don't know how to put it all together. It certainly doesn't have the characteristics of - any kind of a violently explosive thing. And I get to looking around at some of these other craters, and I was speculating on whether or not they're - the fact that everything is soft back here on the back side and how that compares to the front side. You know I guess one of the things that strikes me is that everything back here really isn't that soft. It - It's soft in that the colors are - are very uniform and the -
127:39:44|C|Roo|Could I interrupt you, Ken?
127:39:47|T|CMP|- and the - you don't have deep crevices. Go ahead.
127:39:50|C|Roo|Okay. You're probably just about in the area here for - to look at Kapteyn, you're V6.
127:39:59|T|CMP|Oh, thank you.
127:40:25|T|CMP|Looks to me like I ought to be quite a ways from Kapteyn.
127:40:28|C|Roo|Okay. You are, it's just -
127:40:30|T|CMP|I'm just now coming up -
127:40:31|C|Roo|- this is.
127:40:32|T|CMP|- on Smythii.
127:40:33|C|Roo|Roger. I - I agree with that. This - this is the time you've got listed as to start your preparation and, yeah, you've -
127:40:40|T|CMP|Okay.
127:40:41|C|Roo|You've probably got -
127:40:42|T|CMP|Thank you.
127:40:43|C|Roo|- about five or six minutes.
127:40:47|T|CMP|Yeah, I tell you. All those hours we spent looking over these things so you can recognize them without the map have sure been a big help. You can just look out there and generally know about where you are. Except there's places here on the back side where I still have to get my map out in order to sort out what I'm looking at. It does look an awful lot alike in places, yet you look down in it and I think the only reason that everything here looks alike is it's just like everything back here has been dusted with something.
127:41:20|C|Roo|Yeah, I -
127:41:21|T|CMP|Because there's still these; there are sharp features. You know there's rims of craters that are sharp and there are steep sides. And there's all kinds of things that don't go along with the concept of being weathered down and old. And with the binoculars - they really bring in an awful lot of things, and you see that there are - there's an absence of little tiny craters. And all - there's overabundance it seems like of the great big guys. On the small scale, you don't see nearly as much. It's just like everything back here had been dusted over not so long ago on a geologic scale. You do see flow fronts and all kinds of things back in there just like you do in the maria surfaces and you see little - haven't seen any ridges to speak of. But I've seen an awful lot of fro - flow fronts that run up and down things. And I don't see an awful lot of the elongate kind of terrain that we've characterized with Descartes. Except way back near the 180 point, and the rest of it is almost unique to the backside, I think.
127:42:40|C|Roo|Okay. That sounds real great, Ken. Hey, that bright ray on Chaplygin, what did you make of that dark stuff. Does that really drape over the side?
127:42:52|T|CMP|Well, I haven't been to the place where I could see that and look down on it. But during our first rev - after DO - no - yeah. The first rev after DOI, we passed right abeam of that guy and I got you a nice oblique shot of it from what looked like it was right next door. And it's got very sharp rims on it. It's - it 's got dark material around it, on the inside and the outside, and I guess it's draped. But it looked to me like it was a, you know, a very sharp feature. It had all the appearances of a - what you would think of as a fresh strata volcano would look like as a little bitty guy. And the white stuff looks like snow on it.
127:43:38|C|Roo|Very good, and thanks for taking my picture.
127:43:45|T|CMP|That was pretty spectacular, because we were about, only about 30 miles high at the time, and that makes - really did make it look like it was right next door.
127:44:14|T|CMP|I did find one place up in, I think it's in Guyot where I'd swear there's a hole in the side of the crater wall and stuff is running out of it - dark material. And maybe I'm all out to lunch on that, I - but it sure looks that way. And I got some pictures of that. But that whole area to the north and west of King has really got a lot of stuff in it that I'd never seen before, and I suspect that's because King's been so interesting, we hadn't looked at the pictures around it. And I - I've remarked several times about the swirls and things that I see back there and that they had some topographic relief yesterday, Today, I really can't tell whether they do or not, and I think that's due to the changing Sun angles. And Farouk made some comment about that being near Abul Wafa, and I'm really talking about an area that's north of Abul Wafa by about five degrees. It's about - about if you draw a line between Firsov and King, Abul Wafa's about as far south of that line as the area I'm talking about is north of it.
127:45:30|C|Roo|Okay.
127:45:49|T|CMP|And we're coming up now on old Kastner.
127:46:11|C|Roo|Casper over Kastner; that almost sounds poetic, Ken.
127:46:17|T|CMP|(Laughter) Right. I'd sing to you, too; but, well, that might be better than my music, you never know.
127:46:27|C|Roo|No, if you can't play me "Riding Old Paint," why, I don't want you singing either.
127:46:36|T|CMP|Okay. Well, have it your own way. You don't know what you're missing.
127:46:36|||<p class="tech"><b>127 47 Oh Mattingly:</b> Boy, we sure picked a lousy attitude for this observation. (Laughter) -
127:47:10|C|Roo|... Ken.
127:47:11|T|CMP|I don't care what they say, hanging upside down - I don't - I don't do so well. And we're sitting here at an awfully high Sun angle, which makes the features very difficult to identify. But I have Ansgarius located, and there's La Perouse. And old La Perouse looks like a - looks like an old Langrenus with a big star in the center of it.
127:50:04|T|CMP|Boy, I'll tell you, you can hardly make out much of anything about Kapteyn, due to this high Sun.
127:51:29|T|CMP|No, I'm afraid I won't be able to say anything about Kapteyn. We're past it now and at this high Sun, you can't make out much of anything. He's a little too far from the ground track in this attitude to comfortably do when you're scrunched up in the corner of the window. And I guess I'm looking almost straight south now. Boy, there's one set of peaks that stick up down there that are really huge. Stick up over the horizon, make it look like the Andes.
127:52:08|C|Roo|Okay. We copy that, Ken.
127:52:54|C|Roo|Go, Flight [?]
127:52:58|T|CMP|Say again, please.
127:57:13|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, this is just sort of a general question about the terraces in Stone Mountain and if you get a chance, why, look down around the south end of that EVA-2 traverse, down around Station 5, and just might look in the area and see if you can give any hints on how definite those terraces are. They're going to try to establish at Station 5 on the first terrace. And if you think it looks definite enough, why, that's a no-sweat operation or how easy it looks to determine between first, second terrace, and so forth.
127:57:58|T|CMP|Okay. I kind of looked for that and - I - let me take another look specifically at that. It appeared to me that - probably on the ground you wouldn't know you're on the first terrace. But let me take another look at that - I'll check it out this time. And again - we're only guessing what - you know, trying to guess what it would look like if you indeed were that far down.
127:58:28|C|Roo|Roger. And this is sort of a no-sweat type question, Ken, so don't - don't worry too much about it, we just like to have you lamp that area again.
127:58:41|T|CMP|Okay.
127:58:50|T|CMP|Did they get a chance to drive the Rover around very much?
127:58:58|C|Roo|Ah - yeah. The Rover went real well. I think they had - got pretty much everything in on the first EVA that they'd planned on.
127:59:12|T|CMP|I'll bet those are two tired guys by now, then.
127:59:21|C|Roo|Yes. I expect they are, Ken. They got in 56 pounds of rocks today.
127:59:28|T|CMP|(Laughter) Oh - very good. We've got a place for them.
128:00:21|T|CMP|Did Hank tell you we got a couple of little Casperellos flying along with us?
128:00:28|C|Roo|No. No, I guess I don't get that one, Ken.
128:00:34|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well, the first time I noticed it was - I guess it was yesterday evening. I think maybe you were on when I saw the little particles flying along with me - right after - after the ground goes into darkness and you're still in daylight, then you can see all these things against the ground. And they all flicker and speckle and they come tumbling along. And this morning we came out, and I guess we were going minus-X, and I looked out the center hatch and here was this little thing just flying formation on me and I - in the dark, I couldn't tell how far back it was, but it was just sitting there and apparently it was tumbling because it was giving off little flashes in and out. And it didn't look like it was opening or closing or anything else, it was just sort of sitting there.
128:01:27|C|Roo|Well, that sounds like a real live Casper to me, Ken.
128:01:35|T|CMP|Well, it's so small it's probably a Casperello.
128:01:38|C|Roo|(Laughter) All right.
128:04:43|T|CMP|I'm looking at the - down at the central peak at Theophilus. And it has all of that same crosshatched appearance on the shadowed side that we saw on Silver Spur and Hadley.
128:05:01|C|Roo|Okay.
128:05:48|T|CMP|Okay. I put Power on the Pan Camera and the barber pole's back to gray.
128:05:57|C|Roo|Okay. I copy that. Standby, Stereo, and Power, and you're a minute and 20 seconds from T-start.
128:06:07|T|CMP|Okay. Passing over Kant.
128:06:14|T|CMP|I'll tell you, the old landing site stands out now. You couldn't miss that for anything. And it wasn't that obvious at the lower Sun. Unfortunately, I'm a little too far south to be able to give you a good answer on those terraces, but I'll give a hack at it.
128:06:34|C|Roo|Okay. Copy that. And you're 45 seconds from T-start.
128:06:41|T|CMP|Okay. And I'm just over here standing by.
128:07:12|C|Roo|You're ten seconds from T-start.
128:07:23|C|Roo|And she ought to be -
128:07:24|T|CMP|Operate.
128:07:25|C|Roo|Okay.
128:07:26|T|CMP|I have a barber pole with gray.
128:07:32|C|Roo|Okay. And you've got an Image Motion. You want barber pole.
128:07:40|T|CMP|Beg your pardon?
128:07:42|C|Roo|Okay, You want to take your Image Motion to barber pole.
128:07:44|T|CMP|Do you want me to go back to the observation?
128:07:46|C|Roo|Okay.
128:07:48|T|CMP|Does that take priority over the observation?
128:07:50|C|Roo|No.
128:07:51|T|CMP|Yes or no.
128:07:53|C|Roo|No.
128:08:04|T|CMP|Yes. I think that they will be able to recognize that they're on the first terrace.
128:08:15|T|CMP|Oh, I don't know, over by Cinco they're not that obvious. They are further around to the west, but I'm not sure that recognize the first terrace. They might recognize Cinco.
128:08:30|C|Roo|Okay.
128:08:46|T|CMP|Okay. I'll get the Image Motion now.
128:08:50|C|Roo|Okay. You're ten seconds to a - T-stop.
128:08:53|T|CMP|Stand by.
128:08:57|T|CMP|Roger. Standing by for T-stop.
128:09:03|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by. And we're barber pole on the Image Motion.
128:09:15|C|Roo|Okay.
128:09:21|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
128:09:23|C|Roo|Roger.
128:09:31|C|Roo|Okay. And the lens is stowed; you can go PC off, Ken.
128:09:39|T|CMP|Okay. Pan Camera power is off.
128:09:44|C|Roo|Got you.
128:09:48|T|CMP|Boy, these - these -
128:09:49|C|Roo|And we'd like High Gain, Auto, Ken.
128:09:51|T|CMP|You'd swear that - Sure thing. You'd swear that you ought to be able to see the LM with these binoculars. I think if you knew where to look - exactly, you might be able to see it. But you couldn't hold anything in your hand any more sensitive. I'll tell you, the Cinco craters stand out very nicely and the Crest crater is very obvious from up here. But it looks like the path you've drawn that goes from Station 5 to 6 and 4 - that path looks to me like it runs down sort of a tongue of material. That you can drive up it - and that those white lines we've got drawn on Chart 9 Charlie - really aren't obvious at all. When you get over around more in the South Ray side you start to see these things, but it's just not at all obvious that they're going to see anything - down that path.
128:10:49|C|Roo|Okay.
128:10:50|T|CMP|They got a good system; they should be able to find Cinco.
128:11:10|C|Roo|Okay. Now I heard earlier that you could see Double Spot with binocs. Does that sound right, Ken?
128:11:18|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
128:11:20|C|Roo|Okay.
128:11:21|T|CMP|I'll tell you, it's - they're really neat.
128:11:27|C|Roo|Okay. And I'm sure that they passed on to you that the LM should be 200 meters northwest of Double Spot.
128:11:35|T|CMP|Yeah. I just - Every time I've gone over, I've been looking for something that I thought was probably more worthwhile than just the gee whiz of my saying I saw the LM.
128:11:44|C|Roo|Yeah. I agree with that priority.
128:11:52|T|CMP|I wish they - I really wish we'd gotten into North Ray - maybe they'll still get a chance, because it looks to me like a - that's a pretty interesting path up there. Interesting from the fact that it looks like it's constructional - the ridge that runs up to North Ray crater.
128:12:45|T|CMP|You know that central peak that we've all been looking at in Albategnius and thinking it was so big? It can't be so terribly big because - at least, it can't be terribly tall because it is just now sticking its nose up in the daylight. And the terminator passed here a long time ago.
128:13:08|C|Roo|Okay. Good observation, Ken.
128:13:23|T|CMP|Boy, that straight wall really shows up from here. Just so they know that's a pretty interesting thing. It's interesting enough to rate number 36.
128:13:45|C|Roo|Okay. And I guess you're rocking on, ready for your terminator photos here of Guericke.
128:13:52|T|CMP|Yes. I'm sitting waiting to get a little closer to them. I got Lassell, Albategnius B all lined up and boresighted.
128:14:02|C|Roo|Golly.
128:14:08|T|CMP|There's a lot more of these sharp depressions. I don't know whether to call them grabens or what, but these - these little sharp lines that run across - there's a lot more of them than I'd guessed you'd find.
128:14:30|C|Roo|I suspect that they are showing -
128:14:32|T|CMP|And there's Lassell C.
128:14:33|C|Roo|- up now in the low Sun angle?
128:14:37|T|CMP|Yes They really stand out in low Sun. One of the things - I'm looking at one right here that's next to Lassell C. I'm going to start my strip and talk a little while I'm doing it. And that's at a - one that's just to the north of Lassell C in that highlands clump that's next to it there. And - it looks like in the low Sun, on the outside of it, you see all kinds of craters. You know, the typical low Sun angle pictures of crater patterns. Oh, down in the floor of this thing it's just as smooth as a whistle. Like someone had drug a - something heavy through there and just made a deep impression.
128:15:31|C|Roo|Okay. Got you.
128:17:01|T|CMP|You know it's not real obvious whether I see the end point of that strip. The thing we've drawn I think I see - but it looks like an awful lot of other craters in this low Sun. We'll have to wait until a higher Sun to see if it really is different.
128:17:18|C|Roo|Okay.
128:17:29|T|CMP|Okay. Magazine SS is now reading 47.
128:17:37|C|Roo|Forty-seven on SS.
128:18:33|T|CMP|Okay. It's time for a little Gamma Ray Deploy.
128:18:38|C|Roo|Roger.
128:18:42|T|CMP|Mark. It's coming out.
128:18:45|C|Roo|Okay. We got your Mark.
128:18:54|T|CMP|Okay. I'm - I'll turn it off. Well - it looked to me like in 12 seconds and I still had a barber pole. Let's say I retract it and try again.
128:19:10|T|CMP|Oh, wait a minute. That thing was already 15 inches out. That's what it is. Okay.
128:19:18|C|Roo|All right.
128:19:19|T|CMP|Am I correct?
128:19:20|C|Roo|That's correct, Ken.
128:19:23|T|CMP|Okay. I just - my tape in this dim light, I had the lights turned down, I didn't see the tape until it was already out.
128:19:39|T|CMP|That sort of makes it Sim Bay 5 - Casper 0.
128:20:07|C|Roo|And, Ken. Before you put your Flight Plan away there to exercise, I'd like to remind you of something here.
128:20:17|T|CMP|All righty. Go ahead.
128:20:18|C|Roo|Okay. If you want to turn over to 129:25, there abouts.
128:20:30|T|CMP|Got it.
128:20:31|C|Roo|Okay. You'll see the - the write-in change there that may look funny to you, but we really want those steps done. And what we're doing is turning the Image Motion Off for that pass and that's why it's a little out of the ordinary.
128:20:51|T|CMP|Roger. I understand. This is - the purpose of this was so that they can get a calibration on just how much motion comes with that. They can tell where the zero point and smear comes on the film. Is that correct? That's just a gee-whiz thing.
128:21:07|C|Roo|Okay, Ken.
128:21:11|T|CMP|The information is gee whiz to me; I guess it's important to the people who have to make maps out of the stuff.
128:21:18|C|Roo|Roger.
128:21:28|T|CMP|Okay. And anything else before I do myself in?
128:21:33|C|Roo|No. About the only other thing I've got, Ken, is your - your temperature for the sleep period. I guess there are a couple of things we could do, like we could leave some power on to increase the load, or we could try to move the Temp In valve or we could - I guess you don't have any -
128:21:57|T|CMP|I'm sorry. I wasn't meaning to be complaining. I was merely wanting to record a remark that there was a significant change in the cabin. Sometime starting yesterday, sometime, and I don't know when - compared to what we had had. And that was not something that I was asking for relief on. It's very comfortable.
128:22:23|C|Roo|Okay. Very good.
128:22:24|T|CMP|Sorry if somebody put any time on it.
128:22:27|C|Roo|No. It's no problem and -
128:22:28|T|CMP|No, I just -
128:22:29|C|Roo|- was just glad you're happy.
128:22:30|T|CMP|I thought it was kind of interesting. Yeah, I thought it was kind of interesting and I don't know whether it's because I'm in a 60-mile orbit or whether it's because there is only one guy in here adding heat to the atmosphere. I guess we'll decide that when John and Charlie climb in.
128:22:53|C|Roo|One explanation is that you lost two roommates; but, also, my cabin ran what I thought a little chilly, and do you notice it getting a - gets a little clammy going through dark pass?
128:23:10|T|CMP|Well, it's not doing so bad today. Yesterday, in the dark passes, all the windows were fogging up and every time I'd breath I had to go wipe the window off. Looked like I was standing in front of a pet store. And I haven't had that trouble - today at all. And it looks like it's slowly drying itself out. We had an awful lot of condensation in here - showed up during - after LOI. All down in the suit bay was a great big puddle of water, and we had not been aware of any collection of water anywhere before that. But it had obviously been there. It didn't come out of the tunnel, but it just sort of finally all condensed. And any time you go in to clean out the suit circuit return screen, why, down in the bottom of that compartment you can see that there's a - there's condensation on some of the lines and there's a little moisture in the bottom of the compartment.
128:24:14|C|Roo|Okay. We got those. And I'll not talk to you for a while here. You can have at it.
128:24:24|T|CMP|Okay. As a courtesy, I'll turn Vox off too.
128:24:28|C|Roo|Okay.
128:27:28|T|CMP|Hey, Stu.
128:27:30|C|Roo|Go ahead.
128:27:35|T|CMP|Do you folks have any - if you don't have anything more to pass up on this pass, I'll set my alarm clock here to remind me just before LOS, but I'd kind of like to take my comm carrier off during the exercise period if that wouldn't bother anybody.
128:27:55|C|Roo|No. That's - that's fine with us.
128:28:05|T|CMP|Okay. I've got my tone booster hooked up. And if you want me, send a crew alert and I'll come talk to you.
128:28:10|C|Roo|Okay. We can handle that. And looks like we have nothing else. And if you come up before LOS, fine; if not, we'll see you around.
128:28:22|T|CMP|Okay. See you in a little bit.
128:28:23|C|Roo|Okay. And if I miss you at LOS, I do want to remind you about - you've got to configure the DSE on this pass.
128:28:36|T|CMP|Roger. I've got my kitchen clock set for that.
128:28:38|C|Roo|Okay.
129:33:05|C|Roo|Casper, Houston. Standing by.
129:35:49|C|Roo|Okay, Casper; Houston. Standing by.
129:35:57|T|CMP|Hello there.
129:36:00|C|Roo|Greetings. You're loud and clear.
129:36:05|T|CMP|Yeah, so are you. Looks like we had a little extra trouble locking up that time.
129:36:21|C|Roo|That was - we reacquired with a ground station here. It was a - a switch here, Ken. And there's nothing wrong with the good ship Casper.
129:36:34|T|CMP|Oh, yeah. I was going to chastise you guys for that. I just happened to notice. I was looking out and I noticed that the Earth was quite a ways above the horizon, and I looked down and there wasn't any signal strength. I was - I got to wondering about it. I don't think you guys are sanforized; you're getting smaller.
129:36:59|C|Roo|Hey, if you've got a couple of minutes, at your convenience, I'll give you a - a tentative master plan.
129:37:09|T|CMP|Okay. Let me put some of my toys in a nice resting place, and I'll be with you.
129:37:14|C|Roo|Okay. This is not a Flight Plan update, Ken. This is just going to be a general summary of what we 're looking at.
129:37:25|T|CMP|Roger.
129:37:40|T|CMP|Let me get this thing set up for the photo pass, and then I'll - I'll be ahead, and then we'll go into that.
129:37:46|C|Roo|Roger. It's at your convenience.
129:37:48|T|CMP|Got to switch mags here.
129:39:21|T|CMP|Hey, Stu, I notice that this thing keys an awful lot at any sharp sound in the cockpit. If this is getting annoying, I'll turn the Vox level down.
129:39:30|C|Roo|Haven't been hearing a thing right then, Ken.
129:39:35|T|CMP|Okay. Fine.
129:41:50|T|CMP|Okay. All set.
129:41:56|C|Roo|Okay. I'll have a few - about three Flight Plan updates for you, and when we get through, when you get a chance. But here's the way it - the Plan is looking. We'll have no PC-2 or shaping burn. We'll do PC-1 about three revs prior to LM lift-off, which according to - which will be about four hours later than the Flight Plan shows. We're showing lift-off of the LM for about 175:44. And in the place of the nominal PC-1 time, we'll be doing the bistatic radar. The - they will have the third EVA. It'll be - they're shooting for about five hours on it. And, of course, the prime objective is - is North Ray. EVA-3 and the rendezvous will be done on the same day, and to hold down the crew time, it'll - that'll make it about an 18-hour day. We'll hold onto the LM through the rest period and jettison the LM the next day. From your standpoint, everything will be fairly nominal, up until about lift-off minus six hours. It'll be pretty close to about what we're showing in the Flight Plan now. Of course, we'll have some updates as they - they work the - the scientific standpoint of it. Oh, and TEI will be approximately a day early.
129:43:46|T|CMP|A day early?
129:43:50|C|Roo|That's affirmative.
129:43:54|T|CMP|All right. Any particular reason? I mean - I would - I would have guessed some of the other things, but not that.
129:44:05|C|Roo|Ken, well, I guess it's - it goes down into the bit with we've skipped the PC-2. Why, considering the SIM Bay and the objectives left, everything - everybody's going to be happy and decide to ship you out a - around a day early.
129:44:33|T|CMP|Okay. Where's - we're going to launch the satellite from the orbit we're in? Is that the idea?
129:44:45|C|Roo|Yeah, it'll - it'll be the orbit after PC-1, and there's no sweat on the lifetime, Ken. They - they're guaranteeing a lifetime of at least a year and looking to have a fairly reasonable perigee after - even after a year, from - from the orbit after PC-1.
129:45:10|T|CMP|Okay.
129:45:30|C|Roo|And that's - that's about it. Of course, all the specifics will be coming up to you, and I have three Flight Plan updates just any time you're ready. No sweat.
129:45:46|T|CMP|Okay. I'll go ahead and copy.
129:45:51|C|Roo|Okay. The first one will be at 130 hours 31 minutes.
129:45:59|T|CMP|Go ahead.
129:46:03|C|Roo|Okay. We want to delete the "Mapping Camera, Retract." And at 130:34 delete the "Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Close.
129:46:19|T|CMP|Okay. Delete the "Mapping Camera Retract," and the "Cover Close.
129:46:24|C|Roo|Okay. And at 131:19.
129:46:31|T|CMP|All right.
129:46:33|C|Roo|Okay. Your speed on your camera is changed to 1/250.
129:46:47|T|CMP|Okay. That's 1/250.
129:46:50|C|Roo|Okay. And just to ease your mind on that other note - Flight Plan note - we're gonna - The mapping camera will be left out during your dump and the sleep period.
129:47:07|T|CMP|Okay.
129:47:12|C|Roo|Okay. And 132 hours.
129:47:58|C|Roo|And, Ken, I've got one more at 132.
129:48:02|T|CMP|Okay. You - you dropped out there. I didn't get anything in. You just went silent. I didn't hear anything after - Oh, let's see, where's the last thing I got from you? I got the configuration change in the camera and the understanding that the mapping camera was going to be left out all night. And that's all I heard.
129:48:24|C|Roo|Oh, okay. It'll also be out during your dump. I just wanted to -
129:48:30|T|CMP|Yeah.
129:48:31|C|Roo|- verify with you that that was true. Okay and -
129:48:32|T|CMP|Yeah, I got that.
129:48:33|C|Roo|All righty. And you -
129:48:34|T|CMP|Roger.
129:48:35|C|Roo|- got the shutter speed change at 131:19. And my next change is at 132:00 when you're -
129:48:40|T|CMP|Yes sir.
129:48:41|C|Roo|- when you're ready to copy.
129:48:44|T|CMP|Okay. I'm ready.
129:48:46|C|Roo|Okay. We want to add H<sub>2</sub> Tanks 1 and 2 Heaters, Auto. H<sub>2</sub> Fans 1, 2, 3, Off.
129:49:05|T|CMP|Okay. H<sub>2</sub> Tank 1 and 2, Auto, and all three Fans Off at 132 hours.
129:49:11|C|Roo|Okay. That's the end of the update.
129:49:42|C|Roo|And, Ken, I've got a few questions about the flow of Mandel'shtam when you've a chance you want to talk about it.
129:49:59|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see. I got a few minutes. Why don't we talk right now?
129:50:05|C|Roo|Okay. I'll just run through - There are four questions. Why don't I just give them all to you, and then I can go back over them, but we'd like to know in what part of the floor is the flow. We'd like to know how large it is. We'd like to know the direction of flow. All on-the-spot observation of whether or not you think it's a landslide or a lava flow.
129:50:37|T|CMP|Okay. I covered some of that again on this last pass, I guess. Let me - Say those questions again.
129:50:45|C|Roo|Okay. In what part -
129:50:46|T|CMP|You ... want me to write a few key words down.
129:50:48|C|Roo|Okay. In what of the floor is the flow?
129:51:02|T|CMP|Okay.
129:51:04|C|Roo|Want to know how large it is.
129:51:21|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
129:51:22|C|Roo|Okay'. And what is the direction of flow?
129:51:38|T|CMP|Okay. And your last question was origin?
129:51:41|C|Roo|Roger.
129:51:46|T|CMP|Okay. Let me see if I can get - get a map here that I can give you some reference on. The kind of flow that I'm talking about back there is - is sort of like the kind of flow from - that your - that you - see in the mare materials. It's - it's not a big thing ... that you can trace back like you can some of these other things we've seen. it's just sort of appears as a flow front. It's not sure where it comes from, and you can see it run down in the craters and around them. And, from that - I made a little more objective analysis of this stuff that you see on this back - this last pass when we came across on what we call the - the Far Side Highlands. And it's my general impression that these - these flows - maybe that - maybe I'm using the wrong term - they look like flows. They have all the characteristics of a flow front, and yet there's places where they go along, and you'll see it with the scarp going down to the east, and then all of a sudden it'll get a little confused and then the scarp will be showing up going to the west. And then you'll see places where - there's one place in Mandel'shtam - I think we have a picture of it - where this - this scarp, that looks like a flow front, curves in an arc to the right, and it's got material that comes from behind it. Then all of a sudden it sort of turns back in underneath itself and then just disappears. And there's - there's no flow front where it disappears underneath. It's - it's just a - it's a very strange thing. We've seen that in several other places. Some were appearances in the photograph that Farouk and I were looking at of Baldenburger [sic]. Now, that's on a much larger scale of course. But it's the same kind of problem, where you see a unit which is obviously overlaying another. And yet it's overlaying itself by one that the original unit happens to overlay. It's like a - a chain where each - each ring overlaps the other one in a closed circle. And it is very confusing from that point. And let me look at my map here and see if I can give you some - some better handles. I think I took some pictures back there to mark it.
129:55:53|T|CMP|Okay, Stu. Looks like the map is no help, and the - the only picture we have onboard that I can talk about - is on - in the visual photo book. It's V1A. And if you look at the ren - you don't - remember Mandel'shtam has the - the big central crater and then two little craters, or it kind of looks like concentric craters with a bull's-eye, and the flows that I was looking at were almost on the - I guess-you can say they're on the northern side of the big crater. And they run down into several of the smaller craters up there. And the general direction was with the flow scarp as I'm calling it. Facing the - facing to the west, it runs into the crater on the northern side. That's - after looking at more and more of this highlands back here, I'm beginning to believe that these are not actually flow fronts at all; they just happen to look like that if you look at them in short sections, but I think there must be some other process that's affecting all this.
129:57:14|C|Roo|Okay.
129:57:15|T|CMP|I'm afraid that - that on the specific kind of questions you asked, in this case, I'm - I'm really kind of out to lunch. I - I can't make specific things when you say how large. There - the length of these things that I can trace are the same size as - as the crater that I was - looking at. And I guess that must not be that central one, but one of the adjacent ones - one of the ones on the north. But they're - they're quite long, and they're all over the area. They're in craters; they're outside of them; they're on the floors. You see these things just about everywhere you look back there. They're large, and they're just - it sort of defies my imagination. I see nothing that looks like sources anywhere.
129:58:07|C|Roo|Okay. We got that.
129:58:10|T|CMP|I guess that's a - I guess that's a brief summary to say that I really am not as smart as I wish I was.
129:58:18|C|Roo|That sounded pretty good to me, Ken. And we'd like High Gain to Auto.
129:58:32|T|CMP|Okay. There's Auto. Now. Gamma Ray, Shield Off. Ah ha. And it's Off.
129:58:52|C|Roo|Okay.
129:58:59|T|CMP|And I'm gonna start in on my strip here.
129:59:34|T|CMP|And just for planning purposes, in the future, I - I know we got those templates out, and when we looked at all those templates on the charts, we said, gosh, you know, you must be able to see a lot more from the window. But, photo targets like this one are in the extreme of what you can reach from our windows. I guess they really didn't - they didn't exaggerate those things too much at all. You can see more if you put your face right against it, but by the time you get a camera in there, your field of view that you can control the camera in is greatly reduced.
130:00:15|C|Roo|Okay. Is it true of the - of the hatch window also, Ken? You know that's the one we talked about that looks like - you're bound to be able to see more than -
130:00:23|T|CMP|Yeah. It's not as true there, because you have - yeah, you can - you can certainly see more, and you can - you can get around there with a camera a lot better than you can at these sides. You - you run into - You bang your head against R-12, then you push it into the Comm panel, and - there's always something where you want to put your head.
130:00:42|C|Roo|Hey. I agree to that. I've been in that same corner with the 500[mm].
130:00:48|T|CMP|(Laughter) Yeah, well one of those folded guys would be very nice.
130:00:48|||<p class="tech">But even that, I - I - in looking at it, I'm just holding my 250 against the window here, and with the increased diameter, you'd buy a little bit with that folding one, but not a terrible amount because the darn [lens] diameter's gonna bite you. When you look at anything other than perpendicular to this side hatch window, the two window panes are so thick that you can't look very skewed.
130:01:24|C|Roo|Okay.
130:02:39|T|CMP|Okay. We've started our photo strip.
130:02:46|C|Roo|Okay.
130:07:14|T|CMP|Okay. That's a good place to quit. And that's frame 61 of magazine Bopa Bopa.
130:07:26|C|Roo|Okay. Frame 61.
130:07:31|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
130:08:26|T|CMP|And the Image Motion is stepped up the barber pole and back to Off.
130:08:31|C|Roo|Okay.
130:10:23|T|CMP|And the Gamma Ray Shield is back on.
130:10:26|C|Roo|Okay.

130:11:30|T|CMP|I tell you, Stu, that Straight Wall really is a hummer out there.
130:11:37|C|Roo|Sounds awful beautiful, Ken.
130:11:46|T|CMP|Yeah, with all the things that are on the front side, I'll have to admit that in many respects -- it 's - it 's more interesting. I'm not sure there's any more to be seen or learned here, but it's - there's enough extra variety that it's easy to - to recognize something that's different. You don't have to look so hard to see what's the same. When I look down at the - at the individual sections of material, I look at this Cayley down here, - oh, what am I looking at - Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus, the floors that - that Cayley fill. It looks just on the detail scale as the stuff on the back side does. And the - the rims around the craters like Alphonsus - that material looks just like the stuff on the back side. When you get down to the detail level, it all has the same features. The only thing that I see that's - that's quite a bit different is I don't see any of these rille systems on the back side anywhere.
130:12:58|C|Roo|Okay. Maybe we can talk to FIDO and work in something where you can just orbit the front side.
130:13:12|T|CMP|(Laughter) Yeah, I'll get in one of those synchronous kinds.
130:13:44|T|CMP|I'm looking out here now at the area just to west of the south of Lassell E on a little highlands there. And if you go straight south from Lassell, there's a little tip of highlands material that runs out to the west. Then it stops, and if you take from there and draw a line, I would guess it's almost due west. It looks like there's two entirely different materials there. Like you built it out of two fabrics and then put it down. The one to the north is darker than the one to the south. It's - it's split by a very straight line, and there's a - a very distinct difference in the - in the albedo or the shade of gray that the mare has.
130:14:32|C|Roo|Okay. - ...
130:15:40|C|Roo|And, Ken, you're under one minute to Mapping Camera, Off. You got about 45 seconds.

130:21:43|C|Roo|Okay.
130:30:36|C|Roo|Okay. We've got -
130:30:37|T|CMP|Okay, I guess I'll - I'll torque these, although it seems like a shame.
130:30:41|C|Roo|Yeah. We - we see them, and - go ahead and torque them. Boy, that beauty's nice.
130:30:48|T|CMP|Yeah, it really is.
130:31:19|T|CMP|Hey, Stu. No one ever said anything about the - the P23s. Anyone in the back room know how the ... came out? What kind of an altitude we ended up with?
130:31:32|C|Roo|Yeah, Ken, I've - we've got that. I'd looked at it there a couple of days ago. A little blurb there I'd written in. It said the mark data was real consistent, and I think it was something like 33 kilometers, but I'm - let - let me check that out for you.
130:31:54|T|CMP|Okay, I was just curious. I - I didn't feel like I had as much trouble with that horizon as I anticipated. As far as knowing where I ought to be, my problem was getting the spacecraft there.
130:34:15|C|Roo|Ken, I remember your comment here yesterday about the sextant and the telescope really looking swinging. Have you had any change in that at all, and in particular, the - how about the reticule on your - on your sextant? How does that look to you, and how did the lunar surface look through the sextant? These are just all my own personal questions, so don't - don't take much time on them.
130:34:39|T|CMP|All right, Jay. Yes, I - no, as a matter of fact, at one time I looked in there and saw the sextant was really blurred and I thought, "Oh, here we go. just what you'd said." And I got to looking around, and I found that these eyepieces vibrate on there quite badly. And I guess I shouldn't use the word vibrate, then, but they unscrew, and I've got a lot of tape wrapped around them now to keep them on. And they change focus. And I had to refocus the thing. And once I got it focused, it's - if I turn the reticule lights up to full intensity, why, I get a little bit of a smear. But not much at all, and when I look at the images on the ground like in the - tracking - I took a look during the practice tracking period - and, boy, I tell you, that was just as nice. The only problem was, when you're down low and looking through that 28th power, your field of view is so small you wouldn't recognize your own house if you flew over it.
130:35:56|C|Roo|Roger. Copy.
130:35:58|T|CMP|I still - I'm still not having as much success - with the telescope as I - as I ought to, and I'm - I'm trying to psych it out. I was going to take a look here a couple of times. I'm not aware of any light in the telescope right now, but you just can't see any stars in there. And I'm wondering if the Earth is enough still that it - it might blank them out. Because they are obviously there when I look out the window. But they become a great deal more obvious once I get on the back side, or in that double umbra. And I thought I'd try to make a note to check that in the telescope on this pass. I know when the LM was on the nose, that really made a big difference, because all I could see was LM.
130:36:49|C|Roo|Okay. I -
130:36:50|T|CMP|... reflection off the LM.
130:36:51|C|Roo|Okay, I graded that. You get a very good picture of the LM quad.
130:36:57|T|CMP|Yeah, I can see the quad in [sic - and?] the radar. I can tell you all about them.
130:37:03|C|Roo|Roger.
130:37:05|T|CMP|But even in earthshine it was - it was - you could - you could pick out all the features in earthshine. It was really amazing. And was just - just - just beautiful. And last night or whenever it was when we were playing around there, why, if I had had a little more confidence in the depth perception, we could have done our station-keeping without any lights and earthshine. You get - once you leave earthshine, though, you really need that old docking light. And the docking light, much to my surprise, isn't - isn't good for much outside of 500 feet. And, at 500 feet, if you ever lost sight of the target, you probably wouldn't pick it up again. When you get into 300 feet, then - then it holds the target - with sufficient illumination to see things and tell relative motion. I didn't turn all the cockpit lights down too dim, because the LM strobe is such a beauty. And finally we turned the strobe off just to save power and time on it. And we had no problem at all, but the - I had to help the LM guys how bright that thing was in their face, but I had the impression it wasn't so terribly bright.
130:38:31|C|Roo|Okay. Thank you.
130:38:36|T|CMP|Got another little piece of amazement here that you'll - you might appreciate. It took me by surprise. I did a - I started out and I checked the GDC drifts when - right after we got on our way. And they were running pretty high; and they were about seven degrees an hour if I remember right. I've got them written down somewhere. I won't look for them now. Maybe it was like six degrees, but they were pretty healthy drifts. And this was some time after I got - I checked one set of BMAGS before TLI and one after. And I did a GDC align at 127 hours. I just did another one; this is 100 and - 130:45. So that's three hours and 45 minutes, and the two are off by two degrees in roll, one degree in pitch, three degrees in yaw. And that's the way this thing's been operating for the last couple of days. And I - I don't know what finally got it to square itself away. At the time the platform went belly-up there, why, they were about 12 degrees apart, and they had been aligned probably no more than a couple of hours before that. And I noticed the following day - I started watching the GDC, and I noticed I didn't have to align it very often. And it just seems like the more it runs, the better it gets.
130:40:05|C|Roo|Hey, that sounds jolly good, Ken. I - I had suspected that you've been keeping a rather close eye on the GDC.
130:40:15|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well, I tell you, every time I zero in on the optics, I make about 50 checks of all the switches in here.
130:40:24|C|Roo|Roger.
130:40:25|T|CMP|That'll keep your attention.
130:40:26|C|Roo|Roger. I suspect that the GDC stays pretty well-aligned, too.
130:40:33|T|CMP|Maybe it knows something that I don't.
130:40:37|C|Roo|Roger.
130:40:45|T|CMP|Something else that surprised me, Stu. Maybe you remember. I can see a - a definite horizon for the Moon within a minute or so of AO - LOS. And I - I guess that's the zodiacal light and the solar corona showing up there, but I really didn't anticipate seeing that nice dark disk. And there's a - it's just like seeing the Earth horizon on a dark night. It 's really there.
130:41:29|C|Roo|Okay. Thanks, Ken. We got that.
130:41:34|T|CMP|Do you remember seeing that much horizon?
130:41:41|C|Roo|No, sure didn't, Ken. But I had - I had very few passes where the orientation was where I could - could see that.
130:41:59|T|CMP|Yeah , I understand.
130:43:54|C|Roo|And, Ken, we - re in about a minute and a half to LOS.
130:44:00|T|CMP|Okay.
130:44:02|C|Roo|And I want to - to remind you to configure the DSE here on - on this.
130:44:12|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much.
130:44:16|C|Roo|Jolly good. We'll see you in a little bit.
130:44:21|T|CMP|All righty. Have an extra cup of coffee. And, if you don't drink the stuff, I need some.
130:44:29|C|Roo|Okay. I'm not sure I can even drink coffee for you, Ken. How about a cup of chocolate?
130:44:35|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well, we probably both want the same thing right about now.
130:44:43|C|Roo|Roger.

131:32:58|T|CMP|Hello there, Stuart.
131:33:00|C|Roo|Oh, greetings, Casper.
131:33:16|T|CMP|I just took a - another look at our old friend, King, looking at him this time from the north looking south and west. And, there's no question in my mind now that there's - there definitely some dark material that's on the top of the central peaks, that's on that western side. Before, I couldn't really tell if there was or not. It looked like there was some blocks that might be casting shadows. But, looking back at it, there's something on there that at least changes the albedo and nothing else. And it's not shadow. And I got a picture here on frame Victor that ought to - hopefully will substantiate that.
131:34:02|C|Roo|Hey, that sounds -
131:34:03|T|CMP|That white valley -
131:34:04|C|Roo|- jolly good.
131:34:06|T|CMP|... Mandel'shtam, I took another - took another look at the craters we'd talked about. And, there are two places on there where I think I see these flow scarps that I was talking about. And, one of them is at - let's call it 163 degrees east and about 2&frac12; degrees south. And, you see a little blob that the artist has drawn in there, and that looks like that is part of - of what I'm looking at - that appears to me to be a - kind of like a flow field.
131:34:46|C|Roo|Okay. Got that.
131:35:35|C|Roo|And, Ken, I notice here this is supposed to be in the middle of your eat period. Are you eating?
131:35:47|T|CMP|Well, as a matter of fact, I just looked and noticed that it was an eat period. I guess I will go and do same. I got all carried away with this being the first time I've had a chance to look to the south.
131:36:07|C|Roo|Okay. When we come up down here, in about seven or eight minutes, why, we're showing this - the Pan Camera to have the Power on so we can take a look at it. We want to play a couple of little games with the V/H override switch at that time, to see if we can find one of the positions of that switch that might have a little less effect on our sensor - You know that was - that was a change and we're noticing the sensor has been detecting lower light levels than it should. So, we're going to put the switch to High Altitude for a couple of minutes and then Low Altitude for a couple of minutes, and we'll give you a call on all those.
131:37:03|T|CMP|Okay. Just tell me what you want, and I'll go down here and put my nose in the feed bucket.
131:37:06|C|Roo|Okay.
131:37:20|T|CMP|Seems like I ate just a couple of minutes ago.
131:42:17|C|Roo|Casper, Houston.
131:42:19|T|CMP|Go ahead.
131:42:21|C|Roo|Okay, if you got time there in mixing up your food, we'd like to have the Pan Camera to Standby and the Power on.
131:42:31|T|CMP|Okay. Pan Camera to Standby and Power on. Omm - Om - a - Okay. And Power is on, the talkback is barber pole, and again it 's gray.
131:42:50|C|Roo|Okay, and let's go on the V/H override to High Altitude, now, Ken.
131:42:58|T|CMP|Okay. V/H, High Altitude -
131:43:01|T|CMP|Mark.
131:43:04|C|Roo|Okay.
131:45:33|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, if you'll give us Low Altitude on the V/H override.
131:45:38|T|CMP|Okay, going Low Altitude -
131:45:40|T|CMP|Mark.
131:45:41|C|Roo|Okay.
131:47:59|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. You can go to Center, Off position on the V/H override, and you can go Auto on the High Gain.
131:48:10|T|CMP|Okay, V/H override is Center, Off and High Gain is in - Auto.
131:48:16|C|Roo|Okay.
131:48:28|C|Roo|And, Ken. Just for your info, the field geology team are in the final phase of making their plans for EVA-2 tomorrow. So, if you've got any additional comments, why, better make them this - this pass because they'll have to have it all firmed up.
131:48:52|T|CMP|Oh, I think they're smarter than I am.
131:48:59|C|Roo|Well, now. Don't get too carried away up there.
131:49:04|T|CMP|(Laughter) No, I would really - I'd really hope they make it to North Ray though. I think that's going to be different than we expected it to be.
131:49:17|C|Roo|Roger.
131:50:08|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, we are ready for Pan Camera Power to Off at this time.
131:50:16|T|CMP|Okay, Pan Camera Power is coming Off -
131:50:19|T|CMP|Mark.
131:50:20|C|Roo|Okay, we got it.
131:51:54|C|Roo|Hey, Ken. How did we make out in our discussion on North Ray low altitude there as far as being able to see the - the white albedo or not? Or, were you too far to the south?
131:52:10|T|CMP|Oh, I got ahead. It depends which rev you want to talk about. On - well, I looked at her on the first day, right after DOI, there wasn't any - there was two craters, but no rays. When I went back and looked at him on landing morning, there's a slight ray. But North Ray still doesn't stand out as being the bright guy that South Ray does.
131:52:35|C|Roo|Well, it's obvious I was talking about the - the landing day.
131:52:43|T|CMP|(Laughter) I gathered that it would be the case.
131:52:47|C|Roo|Yeah, by all means.
131:52:58|T|CMP|Right now I would agree with you on anything, Stu.
131:53:01|C|Roo|Yeah, I'll - I'll be quiet -
131:53:02|T|CMP|I'm ... here with my -
131:53:04|C|Roo|I'll be quiet -
131:53:05|T|CMP|- potato soup and my - Ah! Ah!
131:53:12|C|Roo|Yeah, I ought to - I'll be quiet here and let you concentrate on your eating.
131:53:20|T|CMP|Oh, man. This is gourmet style. I got - I got the Modern Jazz Quartet playing "Porgy and Bess," and I got orange/grapefruit, some of it in the bag, some of it on the bulkheads, potato soup. Man, it's real gourmet style. Even got a Beta candle.
131:53:51|C|Roo|Hey, Ken. With all of that, now while ago you talked about some Casperellos - with all that Beta Candle and all that food, you don't have any such thing as a Casperette, do you?
131:54:08|T|CMP|(Laughter) No, I'm afraid I left that at home.
131:54:10|C|Roo|(Laughter) All right.
131:54:14|T|CMP|That's about all this place is lacking, though. (Music in background)
132:07:14|C|Roo|And, Ken, just another comment to close the loop on you on that P23s - the - like I said before, the marking data was very good, and you came up with an horizon of 33 and loaded is a value of 28. And after massaging all the data decided to not change it since we've shown on the other missions that coming back - the - has a tendency to have a lower horizon. So, looks like we're just swinging with what we got there.
132:07:58|T|CMP|Okay, that's just fine.
132:11:01|T|CMP|Hey, Stu.
132:11:04|C|Roo|Yeah, go ahead.
132:11:06|T|CMP|Couldn't pass up a chance to watch the landing site one more time, and so I took a quick break from chow and went and watched it. And had a couple of questions in mind and only got two of them answered. One of them is that counting the - the layers in North and South Ray and South Ray looks different than North in that South Ray shows three distinct light and dark sequences. I suspect they're slumps, but there's at least three bands. North Ray doesn't have any of that sort of thing. It's obvious from this altitude. I took another look for their terraces and the whole area - the thing that we thought looked so distinctly different in the photographs - looked like Stone Mountain and Smoky Mountain were two different things and something came in the middle of it and - it doesn't look that way to me at all today. It looks to me like it's really all - Almost all part of the same material. And I've drawn another little mark on my - on my map. It's just about where you folks said you thought the LM was, except a little farther over to the north. It turns out that there's one little bright speckle there that doesn't look like craters. I don't see anything except the speckle.
132:12:41|C|Roo|Okay, I'm - I'm looking there. Now, go straight for north of the - of the LM and a little to the west, there's three small craters there that are covered with what looks like by ray, now. Where are you talking from that?
132:13:41|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. Did you fade out, or did you stop talking? How do you read?
132:13:48|T|CMP|Oh, hey. I - I had you off of Vox and I forgot to push the key down, I had gotten so use to it. No, I - I gave you an 80 and about - oh, you were looking in the right area. And, let me see what I can give you for coordinates on that.
132:14:21|T|CMP|How about CB 5 and 80?
132:14:28|C|Roo|Okay. We've got CB 5 and 80.
132:14:34|T|CMP|Okay, and you know I'm - I'm not overhead long enough to be sure that that's what I'm looking at, but it looked to me like it had a - a different kind of glint to it.
132:14:38|C|Roo|Okay. I'm sure they've got that.
132:14:52|T|CMP|Oh - hey. I've got one.
132:16:06|T|CMP|Well, I missed it. By the time I got the camera, it was gone. But that little - little buildup that we talked that was just to the west of Lassell, I had it spotted, and I was grabbing for the camera, and I couldn't find it again after I got back.
132:16:27|C|Roo|Okay. And, Ken, if you want to go Accept we'll uplink the jet monitor load; and, it's your choice whether you want us to initiate it or you want to initiate it.
132:16:46|T|CMP|All right, you guys can do that.
132:16:49|C|Roo|Okay, we've got - Copy that.
132:22:19|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. The computer is yours. Go to Block, and the EMP is running.
132:22:32|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much. You guys are really helpful.
132:28:41|C|Roo|And, Casper; Houston.
132:28:49|T|CMP|Be with you in a second.
132:29:07|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead, Stu.
132:29:09|C|Roo|Okay. We're showing the lower 14 minutes to LOS; but, we're going to lose data before that. And, we'd like to get that E-memory dump just any time you're ready. We're all configured.
132:29:31|T|CMP|You got it.
132:29:34|C|Roo|Okay.
132:31:51|C|Roo|And, Ken, on the High Gain, we'd like a Reacq. We'd like Pitch, zero; Yaw, 170.
132:32:05|T|CMP|Okay, you have Reacq; Pitch, zero; Yaw, 170.
132:32:10|C|Roo|Okay.
132:35:01|C|Roo|Okay. Ken, we're going to lose comm, with you here shortly. And, we'd like to get your onboard readouts and if you would get your book to copy, we've got a TEI-41 pad.
132:35:35|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see. Okay, I'll give you some readouts first. Battery C is 36.7; Battery B, 36.3; Battery A, 36.8. I guess all you really needed out of that was Battery C though. Now, you'd like the pyros. Okay. They're - A is 36.7 and B is 36.7.
132:36:24|C|Roo|Okay. We've got all of those. Give us your RCS.
132:36:26|T|CMP|And, you'd like to have - you want the quantities?
132:36:34|C|Roo|That's affirmative.
132:36:40|T|CMP|Okay. On A - 63 percent. Bravo shows 62 percent.
132:37:08|C|Roo|And, Ken; let's go Auto now with the High Gain. We're going to lose you in Reacq.
132:37:16|T|CMP|Okay. You've got Auto. Charlie is 66 and Delta is 67.

|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 39 minutes. [sic - the actual GET is 141:27, but the PAO is about to explain the reason for the difference.] We just a minute ago reacquired [the] spacecraft, Casper. Ken Mattingly is in the midst of his sleep period at the present time. He has about one hour, 20 minutes in that sleep period [ sic - see next PAO statement at 141:34]. And is essentially back on the flight plan. Yesterday at 118 hours, 30 minutes we updated the clocks here in Mission Control and at the same time synchronized the clock aboard the Command Module to the updated time. That time update was 11 minutes, 48 seconds. At 118 hours, 30 minutes the clocks here in Mission Control and the clock aboard the Command Module were moved ahead to 118 hours, 41 minutes, 48 seconds. The clock aboard the Lunar Module Orion is not yet been updated with the new time and won't be until sometime prior to LM liftoff and the rendezvous sequence. [The] primary reason for this is that the crew on the Lunar surface is little concerned with Ground Elapsed times. They will be of course concerned with the Ground Elapsed Times when it becomes time to get back into synchronization with the Command Module and to get into orbit around the Moon. But while on the lunar surface they're primarily concerned with segment times - with the elapsed times. [That is, with] the amount of time - until an EVA the amount of time lapsed during an EVA and that sort of thing. And it has not been necessary at this point to update the clock in the Lunar Module, although for the flight planning purposes we are using the updated Ground Elapsed Time. The principle reason for the time update for setting the clocks ahead in Mission Control and on the Command Module was as a result of the orbital changes resulting from the late lunar landing and the late circularization maneuver, which was performed by the Command Module. This changed the orbit about the Moon and got the orbit out of sequence with the flight plan so that Ken Mattingly was finding that his acquisition of signal times, his loss of signal times and the events in between primarily (garble) of opportunity and so on were not coming up at the same time that they were listed in the flight plan. The alternatives at this point are to do one of two things. Either to change all of the numbers in the flight plan all the way through or simply to change the clock and leave the flight plan as it is. And it has been a procedure for the last couple of missions to make the change simply by changing the clocks. This is the simpler thing to do. We just simply move the clock ahead to the point that it then agreed with the acquisition and lose of signal times in the flight plan. And as I said previously at the appropriate time, the Lunar Module clocks will also be sync to this new time. We now show one hour 20 minutes until cabin depressurization, just prior to the start of the EVA. Based on yesterday's experience we'd expect that the EVA - the crew would begin getting out of the Lunar Module and down to the lunar surface roughly 10 minutes after we start the cabin depressurization. A short while ago Flight Director, Gene Krantz, who is still on the console, checked with the LM's systems engineer for a status report on the Lunar Module Orion and the report was that the LM looks very good this morning. The manned space flight network station, which will be covering most of the extravehicular activity, will be the station at Madrid, Spain. The station uses an 85 foot [26 metre] diameter dish antenna. At about 148 hours into the mission, which will be a good way through the EVA, we will begin to get coverage from the 210 foot [64 metre] dish antenna at Goldstone, California.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 39 minutes.

141:37:45|T|CMP|Are you ready for a status report?
141:37:52|C|Har|Go ahead.
141:37:58|T|CMP|Okay, Bravo 1, 15051; Bravo 3, 6&frac12;; Bravo 4, negative. On the chow. On Meal A, had scrambled eggs, orange juice with potassium. On Meal B, had coffee, orange drink with potassium, and a beef steak. Meal C, delete the frankfurters. Add turkey and gravy and coffee.
141:38:49|C|Har|Okay, we got it. And, Ken, your consumables - we're just about back on the nominal for the cryo, and the RCS is 150 pounds above the redline.
141:39:13|T|CMP|Okay. That's sort of holding its own, then, isn't it?
141:39:17|C|Har|Roger. And if you'll give us Accept, we'll get your state vector up.
141:39:24|T|CMP|You've got it.
141:41:56|C|Har|And Casper, we're clear for a Power, Off, on the Pan Camera.
141:42:05|T|CMP|Okay. Power is coming Off -
141:42:09|T|CMP|Mark.
141:42:54|C|Har|Ken, I've got some words on the SIM bay status, if you want to listen.
141:43:01|T|CMP|Okay. Fire away.
141:43:04|C|Har|Okay, mapping camera is working real well, except for that extension problem. We have a margin of 203 frames. The laser altimeter is still degrading. We're down to where we're getting about 70 percent of the good altitudes. Thirty percent of the time, it's fouling up. The pan camera is overexposing the film, but we can process a great deal of that out. However, we will lose some resolution. We're 58 frames ahead on that. The mass spec is perking along real good, and no immediate evidence of purges or water drops in the data. And we got that retraction problem that you're aware of, where we will leave it out except for burns. And the gamma ray spectrometer is doing excellent work. We've got good peaks for thorium, silicon, and potassium. And the X-ray and alpha particle are nominal.
141:44:13|T|CMP|Okay.
141:44:15|C|Har|And the computer is yours.
141:44:27|T|CMP|Thanks.
141:44:43|C|Har|And Casper, Houston. I've got some Flight Plan changes for you.
141:45:05|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
141:45:06|C|Har|Okay, the first one is at 142 hours.
141:45:13|T|CMP|All right; go ahead.
141:45:14|C|Har|Delete the "Charge Battery A.
141:45:20|T|CMP|Okay, that's deleted.
141:45:21|C|Har|Okay, at 143:15.
141:45:30|T|CMP|Go.
141:45:32|C|Har|Delete the Verb 48 load.
141:45:41|T|CMP|Okay, Verb 48 is deleted at 143:15.
141:45:45|C|Har|Okay. At the same time, 143:15, we want to add, "P20, option 5; minus-X forward trim attitude; maneuver completion time of 143:32. Your Noun 79 is 3 degrees. Set high gain.
141:46:22|T|CMP|Okay, at 143:15, it'll be option 5, minus-X SIM bay; Noun 79, 3 degrees; 143:32 is the maneuver completion time; and I would guess the High Gain ought to be about 01, 170.
141:46:38|C|Har|That's affirmative. And immediately following that, we want to go to the CSM Experiment/EVA Checklist, Gum Nebula photo sequence B, page X/2-8.
141:47:03|T|CMP|Okay. And then we do - get ready for the Gum Nebula sequence B on page X/2-8.
141:47:10|C|Har|That's affirmative. This will give you some warning here because, after you eat there, there's probably not enough time to get that before you have to start it. Okay, at 143:35 -
141:47:21|T|CMP|Okay, yep.
141:47:26|C|Har|- acquire MSFN with the - the Manual, Wide, zero and 170. Just change it to the angles you've got. Normal acquisition, S-Band, greater than 1/2 scale, you know, then Reacq now.
141:47:44|T|CMP|Roger.
141:47:45|C|Har|Okay, at 144:15 -
141:47:56|T|CMP|Okay.
141:47:58|C|Har|Go to P00. Then Verb 49 maneuver to DSM, that's Deep-Space Measurement/Gum Nebula point 2 attitude. And the attitude is 305, 136, 298. And the maneuver completion time is 144:25.
141:48:35|T|CMP|Okay, at 144:10, I want to go to P00, Verb 49 to DSM/Gum Nebula point 2. The attitude, 305, 136, and 298. Maneuver completion times 144:25.
141:48:49|C|Har|Roger. And that was to be accomplished at 144:15, and at 144:30 -
141:48:55|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
141:48:56|C|Har|- it calls for a P52. They want to move that back to 144:26.
141:49:18|T|CMP|Okay. You want to do the P52 as soon as the maneuver is completed, about 144:26.
141:49:25|C|Har|That's affirmative. Right in - as soon as you get in the dark. And could you give us the Gamma Ray, Shield on now.
141:49:40|T|CMP|Okay, the Shield is on.
141:49:41|C|Har|And High Gain to Auto.
141:49:48|T|CMP|You have it.
141:49:50|C|Har|Okay. At 144:30, it's time to start the deep space measurements, the Gum Nebula, and at 144:31, Gum Nebula photo sequence B, page X/2-8.
141:50:30|T|CMP|Okay. And how long does that thing take, Hank? It's about a -
141:50:35|C|Har|Okay. The Gum Nebula - I mean -
141:50:37|T|CMP|Deep-Space Measurements.
141:50:38|C|Har|The deep-space measurements start at 144:30. The Gum Nebula photo sequence - you - If you want to build you a little tape there, they should run from about 144:36 to 144:50.
141:51:01|T|CMP|Okay. That's 144:36 to 144:50.
141:51:07|C|Har|Roger. That's when the photos are going -
141:51:08|T|CMP|Okay, and that's in the deep-space-measurement business, I don't have to do anything -
141:51:09|C|Har|- you're getting deep-space measurements all the time that's going.
141:51:15|C|Har|That is affirmative, Ken.
141:51:16|T|CMP|Roger. I don't have to do anything during that time, though. Is that correct? Okay.
141:51:21|C|Har|And at 144:35, of course, delete that Verb 49 maneuver.
141:51:30|T|CMP|Roger.
141:51:36|C|Har|And Ken, that gets us through the next rev. I've got a few more changes, but if you like, we can wait until the following rev to read them off.
141:51:51|C|Har|You're coming up -
141:51:52|T|CMP|Okay. I'll do the - the stuff that comes up right at -
141:51:53|C|Har|- on Gegenschein here now.
141:51:54|T|CMP|Okay, the stuff I have to do between the time I have LOS and the time I pick you up again is still good. So why don't we just put it off, and let me get going on this Gegenschein?
141:52:10|C|Har|Okay.
141:53:20|C|Har|Ken, we understand that Mag ZZ is in the Nikon, and FAO says that ought to have plenty of film to do the Gum Nebula.
141:53:30|||<p class="tech"><b>141 53 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Fine. Thank you, sir.    <p class="ed">[No comm with Casper for 41 minutes]

142:34:21|C|Har|Casper, Houston. No need to acknowledge. We're back 2 minutes from LOS. All your systems are looking good. Just a reminder to configure your DSE to High Bit Rate, Forward, Forward, Command Reset at LOS.
142:35:42|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I copied you, and I'll catch that. Thank you.
142:35:45|C|Har|Roger.
143:25:31|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
143:25:37|T|CMP|Hello there.
143:25:39|C|Har|Hello. How'd everything go on the back?
143:25:48|T|CMP|Oh, we got a lot of very dim photographs.
143:25:54|C|Har|Roger.
143:26:02|T|CMP|Actually, we got them all in. Times worked out just perfectly.
143:26:17|C|Har|Okay. I'll get your film report whenever you're ready, and when you're -
143:26:21|T|CMP|The only - Okay. Let me give you that. I just was turning the page. I did have one comment; the first - the first frame on that antisolar sequence, I think is probably not part of the Gegenschein experiment itself. I think that's more of this zodiacal light business. But it's a five-minute exposure, and we took it with the spacecraft - Let's say my head's down and nearly in the local horizontal. The camera was pointing 30 degrees down, and it looks to me like it would have had the Moon in - in earthshine - in the field of view; so I suspect that that's not much of a - not a very good frame. The rest of the sequences went - went fine, and the pointing attitudes pointed us right at the places on the chart. And I have attitude errors on the antisolar sequence. I'll just give you the attitudes at the end, and restart it from the proper attitudes. It was 165, 257, and 354. The second part of step 4 was 167, 258, 357. The attitudes in step 7: 169, 264, and 0. Attitudes in step 10: 164, 275, and 359. Magazine Zulu Zulu has 15 exposures taken.
143:28:09|C|Har|Roger. Copy, Ken.
143:29:08|C|Har|And, Ken, whenever you get a break there in your eating period, I got the rest of your Flight Plan changes.
143:29:19|T|CMP|Okay. Let me get a couple of bags ahead here.
143:29:36|T|CMP|Hey, Hank, a little curiosity here that I guess it's just "gee-whiz." I've been noticing some things like I got Tool E tied to the G&amp;N handrail, and I got a pair of scissors strapped down here in the LEB, on a tether, and I got a trash bag up in the tunnel; and most things in the cockpit give you troubles with floating around. They really - you really got to pay attention if you want them to be stable. But the trash bag never leaves the tunnel. And Tool E, every time I've looked at it has been pointing - it's been hanging up instead of hanging down as you would think of it in the CMS. And my scissors are generally up. And I - I had decided that gee, that, you know, that's my imagination. That can't really be. There's no preferred direction. Then I got to thinking about the thruster configuration we have giving us the - all minus-X thrusting whenever they do fire for attitude control, and so I thought I'd take a look here while we're in Attitude Hold; and sure enough, in Attitude Hold, the tool E didn't go up and the scissors do stay down. And I guess that's when we were Free most of that time rather than Attitude Hold. Apparently, you can see the effects over a long period in the cockpit of the minus-X firings for attitude. I thought that was kind of unusual.
143:32:14|C|Har|That's pretty interesting.
143:32:22|T|CMP|And let me get - get a bag open here and I'll be ready to copy while I'm drinking.
143:32:29|C|Har|Okay.
143:32:52|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
143:32:56|C|Har|Okay. Ken, the first change we want to look at is at 145:14.
143:33:40|T|CMP|Hank, if we're going to do this during the - in an actual eat period, the best thing for us to do is probably for you to read them very slowly, and I'll copy all I can and then when we get to the end, I'll read them back to you.
143:33:53|C|Har|Okay. At 145:14, this is a minor change in that Mapping Camera photo pad. The longitude there, where it says "159.9 degrees to 20.7 degrees west," that should be "23.7 degrees west," and it's just for your own information; and that's two and a half revs.
143:34:25|C|Har|Okay. The next change is at 146:18, on the next page. 146:17, really, where it starts there with "Gamma Ray Shield - Off." Delete from there through "Image Motion - Off." That's delete "Gamma Ray Shield - Off; Mapping Camera - Off (T-stop), Wait 30 seconds; Mapping Camera - Standby; and Image Motion - Off." At 146:24 there where - in the block for MSFN updates, we won't be giving you a Mapping Camera photo pad; instead it'll be a Pan Camera photo pad; this is just for your information, and it'll be copied at 148:10.
143:35:25|C|Har|And, Ken, we need High Gain, Auto, and we'd like to verify the position of the DSE recorder switch.
143:35:54|T|CMP|Okay. You've got Auto, and the DSE is in Forward and Forward; High Bit Rate.
143:36:00|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
143:36:21|C|Har|And, Ken, the next change is at 146:27; we want to delete all the little business there with the "Gamma Ray Gainstep - On (up) 4 steps (step 7)/ Shield - On (center)." Delete that whole line. Okay. The next change is at 146:30. At the top of the page. This is a minor change. The SIM experiment status should now be "Plus 1111 and 02222." And if you'll flip the page over at 147 hours, the SIM status should be the same as before: "Plus 1111, 02222." At 147:12, delete "Image Motion - On," delete "Mapping Camera - On (T-start)," and also delete that block for the photo pad - Mapping Camera photo pad. Okay, on the next page, at 148 hours, right at the top of the page, we want to add "Gamma Ray, Retract, to 7&frac12; feet." The time for the retraction is 2 minutes 26 seconds. At 148:05, add "Pan Camera, Standby; Stereo; Power - verify; Pan Camera, Operate at T-start." And, Ken, somewhere out beside that, you can build you a little block, if you like, to copy the Pan Camera photo pad.
143:40:27|C|Har|At 148:17, add "Pan Camera, Standby at T-stop; Pan Camera, Off, MSFN cue; and Gamma Ray, Deploy.
143:41:22|C|Har|At 148:29, where it talks about "Gamma Ray: Gainstep" et cetera, delete the middle part of that so that it reads "Gamma Ray: Gainstep - On (center)." That should be "Shield - On." To repeat, that should read "Gamma Ray: Gainstep - Shield - On (center)." And right under that, at 148:30 there, delete "Mass Spec, Retract to 8.4 feet.
143:42:44|C|Har|At 148:30, at the top of the next column, the SIM status should be "Plus 1111, 02222." At the top of the next page, 149 hours, SIM status code should be the same as before, "Plus 1111, 02222.
143:43:52|C|Har|And at 149:18, the block there that refers to "Pan Camera: Standby, Stereo, Power, Operate (T-start)," that little group, - this is a note to yourself - should be moved up such that the T-start occurs at 149:16.
143:44:37|C|Har|At 149:30, the SIM status code should be "Plus 1211, 22222." And, Ken, that's all of them for now.
143:45:10|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, let me read them back to you, and I'll just start - start back here at the last one you gave me. At 149:30, we got the status code as 1211 and 22222. We moved the pan camera block that's now at 149:18 up to a point where the Operate comes at 149:16. SIM code on that page is - is four sticks [four "ones"], and zero, four deuces [four "2"s] . Same status code on the top at 148:30. 148:29, it's "Gamma Ray: Gainstep, On - or Shield, On." 148:20, it's "Gamma Ray, Deploy." And, at about 148:17, it's "Pan Camera, Standby at T-stop, and then Off at MSFN command." 148:15, it's "Pan Camera: Standby, Stereo, Power, and then Operate at T-start," and I got a block ready for T-start and stop. At 148 even, it's "Gamma Ray, retract to 7&frac12; feet," that's two minutes and 26 seconds from full retract - from full extension, and - I've deleted the Mapping Camera pad at 147:15. I've deleted the block Mapping Camera at 147:12 - Oops, except for the "Image Motion, Increase," which still goes in there. I got a status change at the top of 147; the bottom line is now 02222. 146:27, we delete the "Gamma Ray" line. Big change in position of the Pan Camera photo pad to 148:10. Deleted the little block of items starting with "Gamma Ray: Shield, Off," and ending with "Image Motion, Off" at 146:16. And the Mapping Camera photo pad down 145:12 is two and a half revs and ends at 23.7 west.
143:48:08|C|Har|Okay, Ken. That all looked pretty good, except at 148:30 - want to make sure you deleted the mass spec retraction.
143:48:25|T|CMP|Yeah, sure did. I'm sorry, I just read you the gainstep line. Yes, I'll leave the mass spec out.
143:48:33|C|Har|Okay. That's a good readback.
143:48:39|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. If you don't have anything else for a couple of minutes, I'll go back to feeding my face.
143:48:53|C|Har|Go right ahead. I won't bother you.
143:52:47|C|Har|FAO, Capcom. Is the TCA time in the Flight Plan pretty good?
143:53:00|T|CMP|Say again, Hank?
143:53:07|C|Har|I was on the wrong loop, Ken. I was just checking the time for TCA to Descartes. It's - it's pretty good, what's in the Flight Plan. John and Charlie are - are on their way up to Stone Mountain now to Cinco. They're about halfway there.
143:53:28|T|CMP|Outstanding. Did they - halfway up Stone Mountain or halfway to Stone Mountain?
143:53:35|C|Har|They just passed Survey Ridge.
143:53:41|T|CMP|Okay. Did - Was that real obvious to them?
143:53:47|C|Har|Yes, it was, and the surprising thing is that they have no trouble recognizing when they're on a ray. It's very obvious to them, on the surface.
143:54:00|T|CMP|Is that right? What - what looks different when they're on it?
143:54:03|C|Har|Just an enormous amount of blocks, and - they're - just the way the terrain's all churned up; and they can tell this stuff's been thrown on top.
143:54:17|T|CMP|Beautiful.
143:58:26|C|Har|Ken, the guys are on the first of one of those terraces there, just passing Station 5 now, and they - they were able to recognize the - the ray just by the block count.
143:58:43|T|CMP|Okay ...
144:02:12|T|CMP|Hey, Henry, how do you read Casper now?
144:02:16|C|Har|Reading you five by five, Ken. How me?
144:02:22|T|CMP|Oh, loud and clear. I - I guess you probably didn't get my comment about the glint over on Stone Mountain?
144:02:31|C|Har|Negative. I hadn't heard anything for a while. I gave you a call while ago to tell you where they were.
144:02:38|T|CMP|(Chuckle) Yeh, okay, and I answered you and I guess I wasn't on Vox, I just realized. Just as you said that I - I had just gotten in a position as I passed overhead the - the area, and I was taking a look - I had two things in mind. One of them was to - to ... by the landing area, and I got there too late to tell whether or not I had seen any of that. And then the - the next thing I did was to look over towards the terraces and see how they look today, and - when I looked over towards the terraces, it was kind of strange because I was looking out - And I'd say maybe you can see - at this Sun angle looks like there might be a terrace out there. And you can see Crest [?] crater very plainly. And the - the Cincos, you have to be - I have to be on top of the landing site to see it, and by the time I got around to that, I was downstream a ways; but I got a flash of light right at the base of Stone Mountain; just a glint, like a piece of metal flashed in the sunlight. And I'll bet you anything I got a reflection off the Rover if - if at about that time they were right at the base of Stone.
144:04:12|C|Har|That's about where they were, Ken. It's about time to start your V49 maneuver.
144:04:19|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
144:04:23|C|Har|And, John and Charlie are up there, now. They're at Cinco.
144:04:30|T|CMP|Already?
144:04:33|C|Har|Yeah, they're making good time.
144:04:38|T|CMP|Doesn't seem possible they could go that fast.
144:05:39|C|Har|Ken, you might keep an eye on your middle gimbal angle on this -
144:05:41|T|CMP|Henry, the other thing that - Oh, okay.
144:06:03|C|Har|And I need to get you your mapping camera photos pad up here before we get - you get too involved in this Gum Nebula thing.
144:06:30|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
144:06:34|C|Har|Okay. This is to be copied at about 145:12. T-start is 145 -
144:06:41|T|CMP|Got it.
144:06:42|C|Har|- 18:40. T-stop, 150:16:05. And the image motion changes called in the Flight Plan are good.
144:07:00|T|CMP|Okay. T-start, 145:18:40; stop, 150:16:05.
144:07:07|C|Har|Good readback, Ken. And I won't bother you anymore while you're setting up.
144:07:15|T|CMP|Okay. One other thing I wanted to tell you about the - in the Descartes area. You remember the little cone-shaped thing that we looked at on the plotter?
144:07:29|C|Har|Roger.
144:07:30|T|CMP|Just to the north and mostly to the west of Canoe [?].
144:07:36|C|Har|That's affirmative.
144:07:40|T|CMP|Okay. Well, I - I've looked for it on four revs now, and I - I've identified the feature that it looked like it was, and it doesn't look like that at all. It's just a little - just a little soft mound with a crater in it, and it doesn't look any different than all the other craters when you look at it from here.
144:08:00|C|Har|Well, that's interesting, but disappointing.
144:08:07|T|CMP|Yeah, I was, too. And, actually, that's about the same score for the one that's out here by Lassell.
144:08:14|C|Har|Oh, is that right?
144:08:34|C|Har|Well, in the photograph for that one there northwest of North Ray, it sure does look like it had a lot darker material around it.
144:08:45|T|CMP|Yeah, I know it does, and I haven't had a chance to look at it straight down, but it - from an oblique, it sure - sure looks the same as all the rest of the things around there.
144:10:13|C|Har|And, Casper; Houston. When you get down to do that P52 and go to SCS, G&amp;C suggests that perhaps you ought to - since you're that close to gimbal lock - that middle gimbal angle, you might go Minimum Deadband and uncage the BMAGs. And Low Rate on that, too.
144:10:44|T|CMP|Okay. That's not a bad plan.
144:13:24|T|CMP|Okay. And I got a 405 here, Hank. Light go away if I wait another minute?
144:13:30|C|Har|That's affirmative.
144:13:36|T|CMP|You say affirmative on that -
144:13:39|C|Har|That's affirmative, Ken. You - you wait a little bit, it'll help, but stars 12 and 13 should be available.
144:13:47|T|CMP|Okay; 7 and 13, thank you.
144:13:51|C|Har|That's 12 and 13.
144:13:56|T|CMP|Okay; 12 and 13.
144:15:54|T|CMP|Well, there's - That's interesting. There's nothing in the sextant at all. And the telescope, I still haven't been able to pick up star patterns in.
144:16:08|C|Har|FAO is checking into it, Ken.
144:17:04|T|CMP|And I have nothing on star 13, either. I'm going to press on with the Gum Nebula and see if I can catch this later.
144:17:14|C|Har|Okay, Ken.
144:17:33|T|CMP|I suspect we've got something like the Moon in front of those stars.
144:18:37|C|Har|Ken, maybe you can get that P52 after you finish the Gum Nebula.
144:18:44|T|CMP|Roger. That's what I'm gonna try.
144:19:50|T|CMP|Yeah, I've - I looked outside here, Hank, and I got the optics pointing at the Moon.
144:19:57|C|Har|Roger.
144:20:19|T|CMP|As a matter of fact, I'm gonna have to wait awhile here just to clear the Moon to take this Gum Nebula sequence.
144:20:29|C|Har|Roger. You should be clear, according to the Flight Plan, at about 36 after.
144:20:41|T|CMP|Are you sure - Has somebody verified that these - these long exposure times we're taking are going to be satisfactory when we've got a brightly lit Moon in the field of view? You know we looked at all this kind of stuff on the original, but when we started coming back trying to piece things in here in real time, I wonder if some of those things need to be verified.
144:21:14|C|Har|Roger. FAO's checking. This was the PI's request.
144:21:23|T|CMP|Okay. I - We'll go ahead and take them, but he ought to be aware that I got a beautiful Earth-lit Moon out here. I just passed - I believe that's . Rima Sirsalis and - you know, you can see features, not as good as the first night, but, boy, they - they're still real big obvious features out here.
144:22:35|T|CMP|At least the star patterns all check out. I've got Canopus and Regor and Avior and all those stars in sight.
144:22:47|C|Har|Well, that's good.
144:24:31|C|Har|Casper, Houston. FAO advises they'd like for you to wait until LOS to do the photos.
144:24:46|T|CMP|Okay. Understand you want to wait until LOS. Okay. That ought to get us a little darker scene.
144:25:01|C|Har|We might be pressed to get that P52 in there after that, but we'll just have to do the best we can.
144:25:11|T|CMP|Well, I'm not sure you're going to get a P52 in there either, Hank. Seems to me like I'm supposed to go to a north oblique photo attitude -
144:25:23|C|Har|That's affirmative, and so why don't we just go ahead and scrub that 52?
144:25:24|T|CMP|- and we're gonna be pressed just to make that thing. That's what I was gonna suggest. Good plan. And I'll catch 52 the next time we get in the dark. The platform is - obviously knows where it is. So, we'll go ahead and get this north oblique in here, and I'm gonna have a - It looks like that may be a tight one, too - just to get to it. But I'll - we'll get there, if we have to use the higher rate.
144:25:52|C|Har|Roger.
144:26:08|T|CMP|Hank, you asked me earlier about the configuration of the DSE switches. Was there some problem in the last time I reconfigured?
144:26:17|C|Har|INCO had some data that showed that it wasn't in Forward, and he was puzzled about it.
144:26:30|T|CMP|Well, I see I'm supposed to configure it again here in just a minute. Do you want me to cycle things, or anything like that?
144:26:43|C|Har|Ken, INCO's going to take care of it this time. Would like for you to verify, though, that you are in that proper configuration. He's - at the time that we thought you'd be busy taking all these pictures here, I told him to go ahead and configure it at this end so you wouldn't have to mess with it.
144:27:02|T|CMP|Okay. I'll just verify it, then.
144:27:08|C|Har|And on another check there, INCO verified there was no problem with your configuration.
144:27:16|T|CMP|Okay. I may be mistaken, Hank, but I believe that I can see the outer two rings of Orientale, now. I'm just coming up on the earthshine terminator, and I can see a big circular basin, that's really a - really a big guy - fills the whole window. And I can see reflections off the far rim and off the near rim, and I've got two concentric rings with some flat areas and little - little build-ups in it, and it really looks hilly in there. That's a - that's a spectacular thing; I wish we could see it in daylight.
144:27:58|C|Har|Roger.
144:30:49|C|Har|Okay, Ken, we're about four minutes from LOS. Everything's looking good on this end, and just to pass on something about the guys on the surface, they've got a real good view of South Ray from where they are, and they say that - that - that the crater - the ejecta from South Ray is two different kinds of material. There's some dark material and then the light material that we call ray material, so he said there's other ejecta right along with it in all directions, where there's dark and light.
144:31:27|T|CMP|Yeah? How about that. I think I told you yesterday that - that it appears to me that the interior of North and South Ray are significantly different.
144:31:46|C|Har|Roger.
144:31:47|T|CMP|South Ray shows a great deal of dark and light splotches and North Ray just doesn't show that real dramatic difference.
145:29:25|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
145:29:31|T|CMP|Hello there.
145:29:33|C|Har|Hello. Did you have a busy rev?
145:29:38|T|CMP|(Laughter) Yeah. That was a little tight. I went to a - to a - half degree per second, and we made it. Seems like I had some things I needed to bring you up to speed on. Let me see if I can find out where I wrote them down.
145:30:14|T|CMP|I feel like one of the most - one of the most interesting things I've seen on the back side here is in the crater Guyot. Up on the side, there's a big hole, and it sure looks like there is some big, black blob running out of it.
145:30:28|C|Har|What's the name of that crater again, Ken?
145:30:33|T|CMP|Guyot. Just to the north and west of King.
145:30:40|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
145:31:39|C|Har|Ken, do you have any film reports for us?
145:31:47|T|CMP|Oh. Let's see. Magazine Papa Papa, I've got 77 showing, and - I'll get you that 35 millimeter mag here somewhere.
145:33:00|T|CMP|Okay. On 35, magazine Zulu Zulu, I'm reading 22 frames. I had to retake one of the frames; I knocked my flashlight, and it came on while I was in the middle of one of the sequences.
145:33:16|C|Har|Roger. Understand. And if you'll give us Auto on the High Gain and Accept, we'll send you up a state vector.
145:33:27|T|CMP|You have Auto and Accept.
145:35:00|T|CMP|And the Pan Camera Power is on.
145:35:06|C|Har|Roger.
145:35:38|C|Har|Casper, the computer is yours.
145:35:44|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
145:36:38|C|Har|Casper, we're ready for Power Off on the Pan Camera.
145:36:46|T|CMP|Okay. I'll get that in just a second.
145:37:21|T|CMP|Okay. The Power is Off.
145:45:06|C|Har|Casper, you're awful quiet.
145:45:13|T|CMP|Yeah. I'm doing a little housecleaning.
145:45:19|C|Har|Roger. And I hear your radio [sic - means tape player] running while you're doing it.
145:45:27|T|CMP|Oh, yeah. And this one is kind of appropriate. Are you familiar with Mr Holst's suite "The Planets?
145:45:42|T|CMP|Well, seemed that was an appropriate thing to bring along.
145:45:46|C|Har|Roger.
145:50:31|T|CMP|You know, Hank, you wouldn't think you could lose something in only 12 feet. Right now, I've probably got more things lost than I've got found.
145:50:43|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger.
145:50:56|T|CMP|Somewhere, I lost the ring sight that goes on the TV camera and the Hasselblad. And it's probably wherever I put it. (Laughter) But, unfortunately, I just don't happen to know where that is. I guess that's really the only piece of operating equipment that I've misplaced. Well, that's pretty good, considering the shambles that this place generally stays in.
145:51:53|T|CMP|It's really puzzling. I've been sitting here - one of the reasons I'm not saying an awful lot is I'm trying to get some kind of an idea in my head as to how you describe the differences between the front and the back [side] materials. And that's really hard. Because every time you look for a - an objective thing, you really kind of find that there's a lot of similarities, when you get down to the details. It's not clear that the back side is - would be that much different from the front if we put a few mares in there and a couple of - of the big rilles.
145:52:47|T|CMP|One of the things that I noticed about - most of the craters on the back side, the larger ones - even the ones with the steep interiors - do not have any kind of a - a block ejecta around the outsides. You know. I shouldn't say none, but it's very seldom - You have to stop and look for each block. But there are a few craters like - Chaplygin, and - a couple like that that - in fact, have large blocks around the outside. King is another one that has - The outer flanks of King look very much like the central feature in the interior.
145:53:51|T|CMP|And I got North and South Ray again and -
145:53:57|C|Har|John and Charlie are at Station 5 now, Ken.
145:54:03|T|CMP|Okay. I guess I really can't say I see them.
145:54:12|C|Har|They're packing up to move on down to Station 6 now.
145:54:20|T|CMP|Okay. I can see one, two, three distinct layers and it looks like several streams of material that go from the interior of South Ray over to - One of them points out, goes in South Ray and over the lip and down the outside. And it points over towards Baby Ray. And I'm trying to look at the material - All those things we said we could see, all those lineaments and things that we looked at back in the furrow of Descartes just don't show, Hank.
145:54:56|C|Har|Roger.
145:54:58|T|CMP|And I'm looking down into the floor of Dollond T, and it looks like Dollond T has two different units: one that kind of floods in from the west - looks like it sort of fills the floor there. All that stuff that we talked about and all those things we looked at on the plotter are apparently below the resolution of what I can see with these binoculars. And, in general, as the Sun comes up, my first impression at the lower Sun was that the material to the - of Stone and Smoky were the same and that the Descartes furrowed material was also part of the same thing. As the Sun angle comes up, it starts to change its character a little bit, and it's looking more like the plotter photos.
145:56:38|C|Har|Roger. It sure seems that the Sun angle really affects what - what you're able to see. And - I guess you're about ready to look at Alphonsus. Is that correct?
145:56:53|T|CMP|That's correct.
145:57:26|T|CMP|Okay. We're just coming up on Albategnius and Klein now. Boy, I wish we could get a couple more of those - forward oblique photo passes. That was the one time when the windows were really pointing in the direction you'd like to have them. Other than that, you have a permanent crick in your neck.
145:58:14|T|CMP|I've looked at Alphonsus on quite a few of our revs; and, at the lower Suns, there was absolutely no - nothing I could say about dark halos around those little craters. Now, this time, I look at them, and there's a very obvious dark halo. It looks exactly like the dark halos you see around the two craters to the south of Theophilus. I've looked for some topographic or - or surface feature that might he different between the northern and southern halves of Alphonsus, and I've had absolutely no luck at all with that. I see now one, two, three distinct, dark halo areas and probably a fourth one. The rim of Alphonsus and the rim of Ptolemaeus are inseparable - where I am right now. I haven't quite gotten to it yet. The long, north-south trending lineament that runs through Alphonsus looks just like the photographs. It does indeed run up there, and it runs through the wall, and looks like it's an extension of the little crater chain that runs through Ptolemaeus. Halley fill in the floor of Ptolemaeus looks just like it does in Alphonsus. I don't see any - any really significant difference. The only thing I can say about the dark halo areas in Alphonsus - is that - Well, I can't get the binoculars on them because I can't get close enough to the window.
146:00:18|T|CMP|If you remember that one we looked at the blowups of, I'm looking at that now, and - Yeah, there's a slight albedo difference or a darkening of the material around the - It doesn't look any different than any other crater down there. It's filled in on the western flank. It has a slightly raised rim around the eastern side. It's very subtle. It looks very subdued. It looks just like all the rest of the craters that you see all over the rest of the Moon. Nothing significant about it - except in its setting. I really don't see any relationship between Davy and Davy's chain with any other feature that shows in either Ptolemaeus or the surroundings. The main token - I can't even get over far enough to take a good look at - at Alpetragius. ... is just about out of the field of view. And one thing I am gonna try to take a look at, and I don't know if we have enough Sun yet, and I'm gonna use these light level - red and blue filters, and take a look at Lassell C. And see whether or not there's any enhancement that's comparable to what we've seen with the photographs with the red and ... blue filters.
146:02:20|T|CMP|And just looking at these things directly through the filters, you don't - you don't see anything there at all. I didn't really think you would, but I thought it was an interesting thing to try.
146:02:37|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
146:02:38|T|CMP|And I can see a lot of the - that little crater that's out to the west of Lassell C, the one that looks like it has a little cone ..., is very obvious now that the Sun's come up higher; and it's - it does look a little different, but there's so many of these little craters and little mountain things that stick up through the floor of the mare that it's not real obvious that that's anything out of the ordinary.
146:03:13|C|Har|Can you see the little bright ray there?
146:03:19|T|CMP|Say again.
146:03:21|C|Har|There should be a little bright ray, I think. Isn't it? Near the suspected dark cone?
146:03:31|T|CMP|I didn't see any bright ray around it. No sir.
146:03:43|T|CMP|And you can see all the Fra Mauro area now. And Rima Parry system stands out, and you can see Parry and Bonpland. And most of the highlands material that's over to the east of - of Fra Mauro itself all has the same appearance as though it's - belongs to the same pattern.
146:04:35|C|Har|You ought to be approaching the terminator now. Is that right?
146:04:41|T|CMP|Yes sir.
146:04:54|T|CMP|And - I have been rather impressed with the fact that, in most of these little - grabens or rilles, in the low Sun, it appears to me that the floors of these things have a lower crater density in general than the outsides of the crater - the crater density on the outside of the - of the rille itself. You can see this at low Sun angle quite dramatically.
146:05:35|T|CMP|And just to the west of the Fra Mauro area, we've got another rille coming up, and - in places, it looks like it has a little - little ridge around it. When you get the real low Suns on this very mottled surface - it looks more like you're looking at some of those sponges and things you see in the ocean floor than it does any part of the Moon - the way it will look when the Sun comes up.
146:08:52|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Do you have a - couple of photo pads for me?
146:08:59|C|Har|I sure do.
146:09:03|T|CMP|Okay. Why don't you fire away?
146:09:05|C|Har|Okay. The first one is at 4 - 148:10, and it's a Pan Camera pad.
146:09:18|T|CMP|Okay.
146:09:19|C|Har|T-start: 148:07:14; T-stop: 148:17:14.
146:09:35|T|CMP|Okay. T-start for the Pan Camera: 148:07:14; stop: 148:17:14.
146:09:42|C|Har|Okay. At 149:05 on the next page, your Solar Corona pad.
146:09:53|T|CMP|Okay.
146:09:54|C|Har|149:02:56.
146:10:02|T|CMP|149:02:56.
149:16:24|||<p class="tech"><b>146 t0 03 Hartsfield:</b> And the same page, down at 149:25; Pan Camera pad - T-start is 149:16:24; T-stop: 149:38:04.
146:10:26|T|CMP|149:16:24, and 149:38:04 for the Pan Camera.
146:10:32|C|Har|Roger. Good readback.
146:10:45|C|Har|And if you've got your scratchpad handy, I've got a couple of comments I'd like to - questions I'd like to get up on Guyot, you mentioned a while ago.
146:10:58|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by. I'll get it. Okay. Go ahead.
146:11:10|C|Har|Okay. You described this big hole with a black blob, and the question is: Is the big hole a crater, or does it look more like a volcanic vent?
146:11:26|T|CMP|Well, it looks to me like a - like a crater, like all the rest of the craters around here, except it occurs in the side of a - a crater wall. But - I've been looking for similar features, and there's quite a few of these big - real large craters that have similar size craters in their walls too. So I wouldn't say that's anomalous.
146:11:54|C|Har|Roger. And does the blob look at all like lava?
146:12:05|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well, I can't get close enough right now to see. There's -
146:12:08|C|Har|Okay. We just want you to have these questions -
146:12:10|T|CMP|- two things that look like flows. One of them is a - Yeah. Well, I - obviously, that's one of the things that - and I don't think we're gonna be able to answer that question; at least, I can't. But I - it looks like - it looks just like the - material that you see coming down the side of the mountains to the north of Flagstaff. I know that's lava, but whether this is the same sort of thing or not I don't know, because there's so many places on the back side where you see what appears to be flow lines and if you follow them far enough, you find some pla - place where they get lost. Now this one is a - has a real dark set of material - and when I say real dark, I mean dark compared to the rest of the Moon. And it's - it seems to be - consisting of two different flows, or two different units: one - much lighter and closer to the regular lunar surface; both of them are darker though, and the dark ones look like the same kind of dark material - I'd say it looks the same as what you see in subtle expressions in the little domes in King and along the central peak.
146:13:41|C|Har|Casper, could you get the Laser Altimeter On, please?
146:13:47|T|CMP|Oh. Yes sir. It's on. Thank you.
146:13:58|C|Har|Okay. And could you give us an estimate of how large this feature is?
146:14:11|T|CMP|Uh-oh. I was afraid you'd ask that. Let me get a scale on Guyot.
146:14:23|T|CMP|The crater is in the - almost due - west of the wall - pointing towards Lobachevsky; and I would say that the crater is about - between a quarter and a third the diameter - The diameter of the crater is between a quarter and a third the total depth from the floor of the Crater Guyot up to the rim.
146:15:04|C|Har|Roger. Copy. And - Ken, we - we - you got another opportunity to look at this thing on the next rev, I think. Our figures here show that your time of closest approach is 147:31:04. And you should be able to see it through Window 4 and then Window 3 as you go by. And, this is just for your own information, if you do want to take another look and take a stab at these questions and any other things you see about it.
146:15:41|T|CMP|Okay. I've been - I commented on this thing, I thought, sometime yesterday - first time I saw it - and I've been looking at it periodically. Unfortunately, it occurs at the same time King does, and you - you get all wrapped around the axle trying to figure out which one you need to work on.
146:15:59|C|Har|Okay. Just threw this out to you in case you want to take a look at it.
146:16:06|T|CMP|Yeah. Thank you very much. I've got you a couple of pictures of it.
146:16:11|T|CMP|Let's see. I'll try to whip off a P52 here for you before I start to exercise.
146:16:43|C|Har|Hey, that's real good, Ken. We were hoping you'd donate a couple of minutes of your exercise period for that.
146:16:52|T|CMP|I'm so far behind on exercise now that I may never exercise again. It's really gonna hurt when I get back and have to go to work.
146:18:03|C|Har|Ken, you have been getting some exercise - You haven't been omitting these exercise periods, have you?
146:18:11|T|CMP|No. No. But that just isn't - you know, that just isn't much. I can hardly get a heart rate enough to even tell it's there. It doesn't seem like I can change it with the equipment I have.
146:18:26|C|Har|Okay. Well, we want you to -
146:18:28|T|CMP|No. I get the exercise. It just doesn't amount to anything.
146:18:29|C|Har|- take full advantage of all these.
146:18:33|T|CMP|(Laughter) Yeah. Well, you'll feel better when you get through, having done something like that. Even though I don't think it's enough exercise to amount to anything, it just makes you feel better. I advocate doing them.
146:21:55|C|Har|Casper, we have the angles. You're clear to start.
146:22:06|T|CMP|Okay. I'll catch it at 00:50.
146:22:27|C|Har|And you'd better get your camera set up, Ken, for the terminator photos.
146:22:34|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
146:22:44|C|Har|And when you get that, just might as well do your exercise ' don't want to interfere with that. And I'll just give you a brief call prior to LOS.
146:22:54|T|CMP|Okay.
146:30:13|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Do you read? You are looking good at LOS, and we'd like you to verify the DSE after LOS.
146:32:15|C|Har|Casper, if you still read, the Surgeon says you got your heart rate up to 90 now.
146:33:02|T|CMP|Hank, according to that theory, it sounds like the hardest work I've done in this flight was lift-off.
146:33:08|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger. Hey, INCO says he's going to take care of the tape recorder, but you might ought to verify.
147:23:02|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
147:23:10|T|CMP|Hello, there.
147:23:12|C|Har|Hello: Ken. How'd it go on the last pass?
147:23:19|T|CMP|Oh, it went all the way around, came back out the front side, and I got exercise, and got some terminator pictures, and got a good look at Guyot again. I guess I'm gonna have to - gonna have to make a few corrections to my size estimate on that thing at Guyot. It looks like the crater that it's coming out of is really like half the size of the Guyot feature, instead of what I had said before: about a third. And - not only that, but the - I disc - I saw something else this time that was - also went unnoticed before. The crater is located right at the top of the rim and works its way down to about halfway, then this dark material comes out; and there's two - as I said before -there's two shades of this dark material. Then - a striation that shows up that's like all the rest of these lineaments we've been seeing all over the Moon. And I think I remember saying something as I passed Theophilus on one of our early revs right after we got here that it looked like these - these patterns that we see that are all over the surface - on the sides of every hill and every out - every vertical surface - they all seem to follow the contours of any local topography. If there's a - like in Theophilus, I first noticed it here on the crater rim - There were some other little craters up along the side, and those little craters that were up along the side left impressions down inside the - on these - these striations that run around the - the rest of the - of the Moon, or the rest of the crater interior. And that happened everywhere you looked.
147:25:50|C|Har|Could they be fractures or something like that?
147:25:57|T|CMP|Well. That was what I was wondering: if these are shock reflections or something like that. And I guess that still is a reasonable hypothesis, except these things are all over the surface, everywhere you look - in places where you really wouldn't expect to see shocks; but, you know, maybe they're there after all.
147:26:26|C|Har|Did you happen to observe, going by King this time, anything up to the north, any expression at all of the Soviet Mountains?
147:26:39|T|CMP|Yeah. I've been looking for those for - quite a few revs now, and I cannot follow the rays of King outs to the north and make any conclusion at all about them. I can see some of the ray material that comes down from King, but - or it comes out from King, I should say - but I'm really having no luck at all tracing that stuff to the north. Then I started looking for this - Soviet Mountains; and, when you look north and south - way out on the horizon here - you get the impression that there's north and south trending, very subtle constructional builds. But I'm not sure that isn't just the way we're looking at it, because every time you look cross-Sun, you're gonna see that sort of pattern. Anything that's there is gonna show up, and if you put enough of these craters together, they are bound to make a line. So, I can't really say that I see one; it appears to me that if there is, there's a very, very shallow rise which, instead of calling it a mountain range, I would call it more like a plateau front similar to the Kant Plateau rise as it comes up from behind Theophilus.
147:28:03|C|Har|Could you give us High Gain, Auto position?
147:28:14|T|CMP|You have Auto.
147:28:17|C|Har|Okay. I guess the - the Laser Altimeter is down to about 50 percent now, and - the ground track is not gonna go over that part, so we're not gonna get any laser information to give us any data on the topography in that area. And that's why we're particularly interested in your observations of whether there's actual rise in the topography there or not.
147:28:42|T|CMP|It's real hard to say. I'd say if there is, it's like a plateau though, Hank - very subtle.
147:28:59|C|Har|Ken, could you give us Wide Beam width and then back to Narrow?
147:29:18|T|CMP|Yeah. That doesn't seem to help. Let me go back and try her.
147:30:34|T|CMP|Okay. I've got you back in Reacq and Narrow.
147:30:40|C|Har|Okay.
147:30:46|T|CMP|You want me to try Auto again?
147:30:49|C|Har|Okay, Ken. Go back to Auto.
147:30:56|T|CMP|Okay. Looks like you got it that time.
147:31:04|C|Har|Anything else to report on your back side observations, Ken?
147:31:15|T|CMP|Say again, Hank?
147:31:16|C|Har|Do you have any other comments about the back side observations?
147:31:28|T|CMP|No. I guess there's some stuff around King there again that's just - the more I study that one feature, the more I see with it, which is sort of what you'd expect. And it's kind of nice because it's right on the ground track so often. Looks like there's a lot of material that I would call an ejecta blanket that comes out from it. It seems to climb up the sides of craters around it, surrounding it. And it looks definitely like there's some kind of a - of a flow - again, I would characterize it more as a mud flow than anything else. It looks like it comes out of that south-eastern corner - the stuff that goes out to the northeast and to the northwest is all - looks like it comes out a lot faster.
147:32:23|C|Har|Roger. Can you see any expression of that central feature out to the north?
147:32:32|T|CMP|Say again, please.
147:32:34|C|Har|The central feature there - the "Y" in King crater - can you see any expression of that out to the north - through the north wall of the crater, up toward the north?
147:32:48|T|CMP|No. No better than you can looking at the photographs. There's a lot of light material up there that has what looks like dark material sticking through it. It looks that way very obviously - looks like there's rocks and - it's still hard to determine if those are rocks or if those are shadows, but I've seen it a couple of times looking back from the - from west to east, and it still looks like - hard - shadow, so it must be our - it must be dark material or a block at least, rather than shadows.
147:33:26|C|Har|Roger. We're gonna have the rest of your Flight Plan updates for you later in this rev, Ken. I notice it's supposed to be your eat period, and I don't want to eat up too much of that, if you'll pardon the expression. So I'll hush up for a while.
147:33:54|T|CMP|After a pun like that, you'd better.
147:33:58|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger.
147:34:13|T|CMP|That was so bad, Hank, it belongs on our "Thought for the day" board.
147:34:17|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger.
147:35:08|T|CMP|Hank, did the surface guys say anything about - have they seen any different kind of material? I guess - I understood all they saw yesterday was breccia. Have they seen anything else this morning?
147:35:23|C|Har|Stand by.
147:35:46|C|Har|Ken, most of the things they've seen today are breccia again. They did find one rock they thought was crystalline, but there's some doubt about it.
147:36:00|T|CMP|Well, based on our past experience, when you see a crystalline rock, it's best to be quiet about it, I guess.
147:48:43|T|CMP|Okay, and the Gamma Ray is coming to Retract -
147:48:46|T|CMP|Mark.
147:48:47|C|Har|Roger.
147:48:48|T|CMP|Barber pole. And my watch has started.
147:49:41|T|CMP|And, Hank, how about if I put the Pan Camera to - to Power at the same time I take the Image Motion up, so I can have a couple extra seconds to look at the landing area.
147:49:57|C|Har|That's fine, Ken.
147:50:44|T|CMP|Okay, the Image Motion is barber pole. Pan Camera is Standby. Stereo, Power, barber pole and gray.
147:50:59|C|Har|Copy.
147:51:08|T|CMP|And the Gamma Ray Boom is coming Off -
147:51:12|T|CMP|Mark.
147:51:14|C|Har|Roger.
147:52:21|T|CMP|Boy, as the Sun angle comes up now, the features in the landing area are really fading out.
147:52:55|T|CMP|There's more evidence of terracing and banding in Smoky Mountain than there is in Cone, it looks like.
147:53:11|C|Har|How close are they going to get to that on this -
147:53:13|T|CMP|On this Sun angle, I can see one, two - Say again.
147:53:18|C|Har|I was just curious to how close they were going to get those bands on their trip to North Ray.
147:53:27|T|CMP|Yeah. Well, the other thing is that they were going to go down to Ravine, and it looks to me like the material at Ravine is about the same material that around North Ray. If they get there and come up the way they're scheduled to, it looks like they're going to be on the same unit that they would have gotten down at Ravine.
147:53:54|T|CMP|You really have to look at this stuff in all Sun angles because you see different things from hour to hour. It's really amazing. How we doing on the Pan Camera?
147:54:06|C|Har|Still got a little over a minute to go. I'll give you a call.
147:54:12|T|CMP|All right, sir. It sure looks like that stuff that comes into the - looks like North Ray was blasted into a piece of Smoky Mountain - what it really looks like. And that the Smoky Mountain and the stuff out to the - to the east of there is really probably all from the same stuff.
147:55:10|C|Har|Casper, about 15 seconds to T-start.
147:55:29|T|CMP|Okay, we're Operate. Barber pole and a gray.
147:55:35|C|Har|Roger.
147:58:49|T|CMP|You know, it's very interesting that down there at Alpetragius, there's a lot of the linear features that line up with the Imbrium sculpture. They come right down, come through Alpetragius, go through the central peak, come right through the southern wall, and go on out, and one of them goes on down and hits the rim of Arzachel.
147:59:16|C|Har|That sounds pretty interesting there, Ken.
147:59:22|T|CMP|I'm looking at Lassell C and the little highlands clump that's by it. And - remember, we had a red and a blue color difference, and right now the Southern Pease with a crater in it is sort of a - a tan color, and the Northern Pease is a gray. When I look at the mare, I see a big swatch of - of the tan-colored mare down to the south that goes over towards Guericke. And I see a - a tongue of darker gray material. The area around Lassell C has the tan tone to it. Then it goes out about as far as our little cone and the little bright crater next to it. That's about the outer limit - maybe just a little beyond. Then there's a patch of the - of this tan stuff that's down to the south that about lines up with the big Achaean rille that's over to the southeast. Then there's a patch in the gray-colored mare down inside of that. It's just a little circular piece. In looking at the Lassell C feature - a look at it in detail - it appears to me that this tan stuff on the south end of it has fewer craters than the stuff on the north, although not an awful lot, but there's little pitted craters all over the northern part. They're not on the southern parts and there are a couple of light, streaked bands that appear in the southern clump that you don't see in the north.
148:01:31|C|Har|Can you still see Lassell?
148:01:37|T|CMP|Say again, Hank.
148:01:38|C|Har|Can you still see Lassell?
148:01:47|T|CMP|Just barely, yeah.
148:01:49|C|Har|Okay. I'm just curious why we don't see that little dark feature that's been reported there near the bright one - up to the west of Lassell C.
148:02:01|T|CMP|Oh, you do, Hank. I didn't mean to say you didn't see it. I said it doesn't look like what we saw before - what we thought we saw. It's a smooth sided thing. Let me get the binocs on it.
148:02:34|T|CMP|Smooth-sided, but through the binoculars, it doesn't look at all like a cone. It looks like a little dome with one side of it broken out. And there are several other little domes out here now that I hadn't seen before.
148:03:00|C|Har|When you say side broken out, do you mean like a - a - a - fractured-out piece, or did it look more like a crater?
148:03:13|T|CMP|Well, through the - to the visual - just to your eyeball, it looks like a - I'll have to catch that again later, but it looked, to the eyeball, like it had a little crater in it. When I got the binoculars on it, it looked like there was just a section of it that was broken out.
148:03:35|C|Har|Any evidence of where it went?
148:03:43|T|CMP|No, sir. That's a loaded question.
148:03:50|C|Har|Roger (laughter).
148:03:52|T|CMP|Next thing you're going to want to know how it came to be there.
148:04:00|C|Har|Do the other - Are the other domes similar in appearance to that one?
148:04:06|T|CMP|Yeah. They're not as large, and I hadn't seen those before just now. They're right in the corner of the window, as usual. It's going to take a little work to find them.
148:04:21|C|Har|Are they all complete, or do they have pieces missing also?
148:04:37|T|CMP|Hank, I just saw them at the time I mentioned them. And best I could tell, they are complete.
148:04:45|C|Har|Okay.
148:04:49|T|CMP|But I'll have to take another look. You know, I could have been - I could have got caught with a crater that inverted on me too. I am going to have to look carefully to make sure I didn't do that.
148:05:08|C|Har|And, Ken, we're about 15 seconds from T-stop.
148:05:28|T|CMP|Okay. Standby.
148:06:03|T|CMP|How about if I go ahead and put the gamma ray out?
146:06:09|C|Har|Roger. Go ahead, and the lens is stowed.
148:06:15|T|CMP|Okay. And the Power is coming Off the Pan Camera -
148:06:19|T|CMP|Mark. The Gamma Ray Boom is on its way out with a barber pole. And I guess you'd like to have the Shield Off. While I'm about it, I'll do that. And I'm ready to copy your pads, or whatever things you said you had there.
148:06:51|C|Har|And, Ken, could you get the mass spec on for us all?
148:07:03|T|CMP|It's on.
148:07:04|C|Har|Roger.
148:07:26|C|Har|Okay, the first change is at 1 -
148:07:28|T|CMP|Did we lose an element?
148:07:30|C|Har|Negative. That was a Flight Plan change we were just getting to. We want to look at it for a rev off, and then we're going to bring it back on.
148:07:43|T|CMP|Okay, (laughter) that was the one that we had agreed was a - was a "Don't waste time call." I thought maybe you just watched an element burn out.
148:07:52|C|Har|Negative. I guess I should have warned you before I hollered that. The first change after that comes at 149:39.
148:08:05|T|CMP|Go ahead.
148:08:07|C|Har|Okay. After "Pan Camera - standby (T-stop)," add "Gamma Ray, Deploy; Pan Camera, off (MSFN cue)." And I don't know whether you can squeeze it in 06 there or not, but, we also want to add, "Mass Spec Discriminator, High." Up.
148:08:45|T|CMP|Okay. I got "Gamma Ray, Deploy" after "Pan Camera to standby" at 149:38. And I'll get the "Pan Camera, off" until you tell me or when you tell me. I'll take the "Mass Spec Discriminator to High.
148:09:01|C|Har|That's affirmative. And in the little MSFN update block there, cancel - delete the photo pad - PC photo pad, the LTV photo pad, and the manoeuvre pad. And change the "TEI-53" to TEI-54.
148:09:23|T|CMP|Okay.
148:09:25|C|Har|All righty. At 149:45, "Mass Spec Discriminator to Low." Down.
148:09:42|T|CMP|Okay. "Mass Spec Discriminator, Low" at 149:45.
148:10:09|T|CMP|Hey. Hey, Hank? What do you want? You're - you're getting into areas where we get AOS next time. How about letting me go ahead and work on this sunrise solar corona setup? That's a time-critical guy that if I don't get it just right, I'll miss it.
148:10:27|C|Har|Okay.
148:10:28|T|CMP|Can I get the rest of those updates then?
148:10:30|C|Har|That's affirmative.
148:10:37|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
148:11:58|T|CMP|Minus 3 minutes before ...
148:17:34|T|CMP|Okay. The Shield is on.
148:17:37|C|Har|Copy.
148:27:40|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're about 4 minutes or so from LOS. We may lose the high gain here shortly. Everything is looking good at this point. And INCO says it might help on acquisition to tweak your dial a little bit. Pitch, 10; Yaw, 0 for the next acquisition. And like to remind you to configure your DSE.
148:28:07|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Thank you.
149:22:34|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
149:22:36|T|CMP|Hello, Houston. Are you there?
149:22:38|C|Har|Roger. How's it going?
149:22:43|T|CMP|Oh, just fine. That last sequence worked out just right on the money. Last frame -
149:22:51|C|Har|Glad to hear that.
149:22:52|T|CMP|- off and up came the Sun.
149:22:58|C|Har|What could you see through your Polaroid filter?
149:23:04|T|CMP|Oh, it doesn't do a thing. There's apparently just a little bit of polarizing done by the windows. And as I rotate the filter, why, it brightens and dims the scene just slightly. And I checked it against different types of material - the darker materials and the lighter things. And they all seemed to respond exactly the same way. I can't see any - I can't see any effects of polarizing from the surface reflection at all.
149:23:40|C|Har|I believe I would have expected a difference.
149:23:57|T|CMP|That time as I went by King, I took a look at a little different approach. I started out with the central peak and I tried to follow it to the worth. And it appeared to me that perhaps those central peak three prongs - I was looking at the crater blocks that are on them. And then I looked at the floor, and there's a lot of crater blocks that are laying on the floor in between the two main tongues of that central fork. The - it appears to me now that maybe there were three of those pieces of central peak that run out instead of two and that perhaps they curve a little bit over to the right. Because you do see a line of the light material that continues on to the north for quite a distance that's the same thing we have seen on the photos. The first time that I've been able to see any continuous chain that goes between the central peak into the walls. And I'd like to look one more time, and see if there's any variation in the number of blocks that I see as I look circumferentially around the wall. Perhaps there is - Where the expression of the central peak goes through, I may find a higher concentration of blocks. That's what I'd like to look for next. But it looks like perhaps those - if those central features do go through the wall, that they must take a slight curve to the right. As the Sun angle comes down, these things that I reported as swirls look more and more like swirls than they did at the higher Sun, which is just backwards from what I would have anticipated, and -
149:25:59|C|Har|Ken, we are coming up on T-stop for the Pan Camera.
149:26:05|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
149:26:18|T|CMP|And, it's off - or Standby, I should say.
149:26:38|T|CMP|And the Gamma Ray is going back out.
149:27:03|C|Har|Casper, the lens is stuck.
149:27:05|T|CMP|Mass Spec Discriminator is going to High.
149:27:20|C|Har|Casper, you are clear to go Power Off on the Pan Camera.
149:27:26|T|CMP|Okay. Pan Camera Power is Off.
149:27:58|C|Har|Your comment that there may be a third fork in that thing is kind of interesting. You can - If you use imagination, you might see it in a photograph, although I'm not too sure.
149:28:13|T|CMP|Well, that's kind of a - that's kind of tenuous thing to be saying. I'm going to have to look some more; but I was - I - I started by tracing the blocks down the ridge in one of the peaks and then following it. And it looked - it curved, and I just followed it around. And sure enough, it looked like you hit a place along the wall where there might have been a higher concentration of blocks. And in the length of time you're overhead with this window orientation, that's about - you just can - you get this in little bitty bits and pieces. That's where that Polaroid sure would be nice. If you see something like that, and you would like to think about it, then plan your next pass - Instead of doing all your planning in real time, you could lay that picture out in front of you, and - and take a look at it, and then come back next time a little smarter.
149:29:03|C|Har|Yeah, that - that - that'd be nice. Shame we don't have it.
149:32:23|C|Har|Casper, could you give us Auto on the High Gain?
149:32:30|T|CMP|Okay. How about that?
149:32:35|C|Har|Thank you.
149:33:51|C|Har|Casper, we're ready for a Discriminator, Low.
149:33:59|T|CMP|Okay, Discriminator's going back to Low -
149:33:02|T|CMP|Mark it.
149:34:07|C|Har|And I have the rest of these Flight Plan changes for you. Just give me a - a call when you're ready to take them.
149:34:17|T|CMP|Gee, I'll finish my little chores here and be with you.
149:37:06|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. Ready to copy.
149:37:36|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We left off, I think, about 150 hours.
149:37:43|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
149:37:45|C|Har|Okay. That SIM code should be, "Plus all l's" and then, "0, all 2's.
149:38:01|T|CMP|Okay. "Plus all 1's" and "0, all 2's.
149:38:05|C|Har|And at the same time, we want to delete the "PC, Standby" through the "PC, Operate (T-start)." Want to keep the comment in there about the image motion.
149:38:18|T|CMP|Okay, that's deleted. Okay.
149:38:36|C|Har|Okay. At 150:10, delete the Pan Camera photo pad.
149:38:45|T|CMP|Okay, that pad's deleted.
149:38:50|C|Har|Okay. And starting there at about 150:13, we want to delete everything except - Maybe I ought to read off what we ought to delete. Delete the "Pan Camera, Mono." Delete the "Pan Camera, Standby." We want to keep the Mapping Camera stuff. Delete "Pan Camera, Off." Delete the - Stand by.
149:39:31|C|Har|Okay. Delete the "Mapping Camera, Ion Source, Off." Delete "Experiment, Standby." Delete the caution. Delete the "Man - Mapping Camera, Retract." Delete "X-Ray, Standby." Delete "Gamma Ray, Retract." Delete the MSFN block there, the whole block. Delete the "Mapping Camera, Retract." Delete the "Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Close." Delete "P00, enable all jets." Delete the Verb 49 maneuver thing, both lines, and the high gain remark. And that should leave us with "Mapping Camera, Off (T-stop) Wait 30 seconds. Mapping Camera, Standby. Image Motion, Off. Laser Altimeter, Off. Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Close.
149:40:33|T|CMP|Okay. I concur.
149:40:35|C|Har|Okay. And in addition, back up at 150:18 now, we want to add in there, "Mass Spec, Ion Source, On - up.
149:40:55|T|CMP|Okay. You want to add the "Mass Spec, Ion Source, On" at 150:14.
149:41:02|C|Har|That's affirmative, sir. And we - we still got the urine dump in there. And at 150:30, the experiment status should be "Plus 1110, 01222.
149:41:31|T|CMP|Okay. That's "Plus all 1's, 01222.
149:41:31|||<p class="tech"><b>149 4l 38 Hartsfield: </b> Negative. In the first register there, the last digit is 0. Because we got the -
149:41:46|T|CMP|Okay. "Plus 1110.
149:41:47|C|Har|- Alpha Particle door closed.
149:41:52|T|CMP|Roger.
149:41:53|C|Har|Okay. And right after that, we want to delete both of those P52s. Both the Option 3 and the Option 1.
149:42:05|T|CMP|Okay, they're deleted.
149:42:12|C|Har|Okay. That does it for now, Ken.
149:42:17|T|CMP|(Laughter) It didn't leave much, did it? I'll tell you one thing -
149:42:23|C|Har|...
149:42:24|T|CMP|- I want to squeeze in here somewhere, and I'm not sure we're at the right place to do it. But I have yet to pick up a star pattern in the telescope. And I'm going to take one of these backside areas here and make a concerted effort to that.
149:42:39|C|Har|All righty.
149:42:41|T|CMP|But I can see plenty of stars all over the place outside, and I just can't see a thing through that telescope. And I know we could when we were in Earth orbit, because the first thing I thought was that we didn't have it, and then I waited until we got around and looked at a bright part of the sky, and we got hold of Scorpion. It was there and it was all beautiful. And now, I look out there and it's just - there's just nothing there. It's just black. And that's after getting well dark adapted.
149:43:13|C|Har|Where did they go?
149:43:17|T|CMP|(Laughter) I don't know. Maybe it was their eat period. They're all out to lunch.
149:44:22|T|CMP|Hey, Henry.
149:44:25|C|Har|Go ahead.
149:44:30|T|CMP|You know, we were gonna separate the - the water dump from the other dumps on one of these passes somewhere. And I don't know where that is, but I - We're not getting very much collected, and we probably ought to - I think I'll just hang onto it until it comes time to use it.
149:44:55|C|Har|Okay.
149:46:55|T|CMP|I'm looking at the little bright crater that has the ray-excluded zone that's just south of Mädler, and it looks like there is a little bit of - like there's a little topographic high that runs right down one ridge of that ray-excluded zone. That's the one that goes through the south. And it looked like there was a little dark material in there, and maybe on another pass, I'll get a chance to see it better.
149:47:37|C|Har|Where is it you're looking, Ken?
149:47:43|T|CMP|Say again, Hank?
149:47:46|C|Har|Where - where are you looking, now?
149:47:51|T|CMP|That's a little bright crater with a ray-excluded zone that's just about south of Mädler. And I'm looking at Mädler now, and that stuff that makes the bright ray material going out the - to the east seems to come up to the rim. You can see it - It's brighter in that area along going down the - inside of the rim. Then there's a bright streak that runs across the central area, right across and up the other side. And then it sort of stops when it gets to the other rim. But there's a faint evidence of a - of another continuation of that streak.
149:48:37|C|Har|And that's in Mädler?
149:48:42|T|CMP|That's in Mädler, yes.
149:50:56|T|CMP|Okay. In this higher Sun, it sure appears that the - the bright things that run down into - come out of the Descartes bright spot and run north, seem to be centered around - that's Dollond - I guess that's Dollond B or A - whatever that thing is. I tried to trace the boundaries and all this material that's in what we call the furrowed Descartes that runs up and it becomes part of Smoky Mountain. That material looks just exactly like most of that stuff on the back side, except it may be a little bit darker, and I think that's the Sun angle. That whole area has that same characteristic to me.
149:52:00|C|Har|Roger.
149:52:12|C|Har|You remember that northwest-southeast trending we saw in the vicinity of North Ray that looked like it was some offsets in those grabens? Can you see any of that in there?
149:52:27|T|CMP|Just a second. I'm not sure about that. But it does appear to me as if the - the floor that the LM has landed on is indeed a different unit that sticks in, and it's more part of this Cayley material that's farther out to the - to the west. And it does go back just about the way we had drawn the boundaries. Say again your question?
149:52:53|C|Har|I just remember on a plotter, we looked at what appeared to be some graben that came across Smoky Mountain and down to the southeast of it and going back up the northwest. And they were all offset like they may have been some faulting in that area.
149:53:12|T|CMP|Okay. Well, I'm not sure what that all is, Hank. That same texture that has many patterns and linear lines and they make a kind of a hash, but that same thing appears all over the - the surface when you look at it in detail. I think I can probably take a picture of most any one of these places down here and analyze it in depth and come up with a very similar picture. And especially the things on the back side look exactly like that Descartes area. It's just that Descartes area is a very small place. And you see so much on the back side that covers that same kind of thing.
149:54:00|C|Har|John and Charlie reported - I guess it's just south of - between where the LM landed and - and Stone Mountain - what appeared to be subdued crater that was some 300 meters in diameter and maybe 50 meters deep that didn't show on our map. Were you able - Can you detect something like that?
149:54:25|T|CMP|You know, there's so much noise down there, Hank, I can hardly understand you. Would you say again? Sounds like you're trying to shout over a football game.
149:54:34|C|Har|Roger. I'll try again, I guess. John and Charlie reported a very large crater, maybe some 300 meters in diameter, that was between the LM site and Stone Mountain. They were on their way back from Station 8, and this thing wasn't on their maps, but it was very obvious to them as they were driving.
149:55:02|T|CMP|I'll look and see. I really hadn't taken the time to compare features just one by one.
149:55:19|C|Har|Ken, could you give us a barber pole on Image Motion?
149:55:25|T|CMP|Okay, barber pole on the IMC.
149:55:30|C|Har|That's one I - slipped by -
149:55:31|T|CMP|There it is.
149:55:32|C|Har|- me when I got to talking.
149:55:37|T|CMP|I'm sorry. Say again?
149:55:39|C|Har|I let that one slip by me when I got to talking to you about the landing site.
149:55:46|T|CMP|Uh-oh. I think you'd go a long ways before you get very far behind.
149:57:14|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
149:57:20|T|CMP|Go ahead, Hank.
149:57:21|C|Har|Roger. So far, we haven't seen anything - a smear [?] or anything requesting that urine dump by itself. So that thing is still in question. Your next urine dump would be scheduled for 20 hours from now. But it's also scheduled in conjunction with a water dump, et cetera. So I don't know where that thing stands. We're gonna check into it.
149:57:44|T|CMP|Okay. It'll probably take me another 20 hours to make it worthwhile.
149:57:49|C|Har|Roger (laughter).
149:58:28|T|CMP|Golly.
149:59:19|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I got a better visual on that little thing we called a cone, and I guess it looks like it is a crater in the top of it. And from where I am, it looks like the southern end of it, which is away from me, probably has just about reached down level with the mare floor. The rest of it is just a smooth cone that sticks up. It does have some small craters on it. The rim looks relatively sharp, and there's a couple of fractures go through it. Its texture and albedo do not look significantly different than the mare around it. There is a little expression of perhaps a subtle depression around the eastern side of it that looks like it might be a little flow characteristic there. I'm going to shift my gaze down to these other two features, and I guess - my guess is I really had those things reversed. They in fact were shallow craters.
150:00:36|C|Har|Hey, that does sound more like a little vein or a cone to me.
150:00:43|T|CMP|Well, it just looks so much like all the rest of the things around here, Hank. The texture of the surface looks like it is all the same. The flanks of it are fairly steep though. And it's got one of the sharper rims for a raised rim crater of any that I've seen.
150:00:43|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 25 minutes. The Lunar Module cabin pressure is back now to about its normal level of around 5 pounds per square inch. During the next hour and half Duke and Young will be getting things clean up, stowed in the cabin, getting out of their suits and that will be followed by a debriefing on the EVA. We'll then allow them about 30 to 45 minutes to eat. They'll recharge the potable life support systems in preparation for the 3rd EVA tomorrow. And get ready for an 8 hour rest period which is scheduled to begin at about 154 hours 30 minutes. During the 2nd EVA while Young and Duke were on the lunar surface, Ken Mattingly in the Command Module Casper was making good progress carrying out all his flight plan activities, photography and operating the experiments in the scientific instrument module bay of the service module. Flight Director Donald Puddy who has been following the activities of the CSM reports that everything is looking good with the spacecraft and the experiments. With one relatively one minor exception the laser altimeter is returning about 50 percent useable data. About 1 out of every 2 altimeter readings that we're getting back is not usable. But with that exception, all the SIM bay experiments appear to be functioning properly. And Mattingly is reported to be in good spirits. Very chipper with the words that Don Puddy used in describing him. And things going very well aboard Casper. At the present time the CSM is in its 39th revolution of the Moon.

150:01:42|T|CMP|And as we come over here - we're coming up on the Fra Mauro, Bonpland, and Parry combination, and I think that's - that's Parry that has - looks like two - almost right-angle rilles running through it.
150:02:18|T|CMP|I'm looking at Rima Parry. I don't remember the number. It's the western one that runs out of Fra Mauro. And it seems like it is more than just my imagination that says that the floor of that stuff is indeed smoother than the - has fewer large craters than you see in the surrounding areas, although it's pretty close to being equal in small craters.
150:04:01|C|Har|Casper, you're coming up on T-stop.
150:04:21|T|CMP|Okay, it's Off for 30 seconds.
150:06:03|T|CMP|Okay, Mapping Camera's going to Standby. The Image Motion is Off. Barber pole and gray. Laser Altimeter is Off.
150:06:25|C|Har|Mass Spec Ion Source, On?
150:06:29|T|CMP|And the Ion Source is On.
150:06:33|C|Har|And did I hear you say Image Motion, Off?
150:06:38|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
150:06:41|C|Har|Okay, I guess -
150:06:42|T|CMP|And Alpha X-Ray Cover coming to Closed.
150:06:56|C|Har|Okay, I guess that about cleans that up -
150:06:58|T|CMP|And it's Closed.
150:07:28|C|Har|Okay, Casper. I have a - a - a block data pad for you and some Flight Plan changes.
150:07:38|T|CMP|Okay. Why don't you start with the Flight Plan changes.
150:07:42|C|Har|Okay. At 151 hours, and - we want to - let's see, 151 -
150:07:54|T|CMP|Hey, Hank. Hey, Hank. Have you got two loops punched up? Have you got two loops punched up? The noise is getting louder and louder. It sounds like I got - I'm trying to listen to you over a football game. And I can hardly hear you over the din of everything else. I don't know whether you need to hold the mike closer to your mouth, or whether you got another loop punched up and I'm getting cross-feed.
150:08:20|C|Har|Okay. Let's try again, Ken. How do you read now?
150:08:26|T|CMP|That sounds a little better.
150:08:28|C|Har|Okay. I've told them to hold it down a little, too. At 151 hours, the SIM code should be "Plus 1110, 01222.
150:08:50|T|CMP|Okay. That's "Plus 1110, 01222.
150:08:55|C|Har|Roger. And right at 151, over to the left of that, write "Configure comm per S-band with VHF bistatic.
150:09:14|C|Har|Now that's a real long bunch of switch settings there. Do you want me to read them all off? Or your - I can give you a procedure on page -
150:09:27|T|CMP|Yeah, why don't you give me the page that it was on in the old Flight Plan in Volume 1 -
150:09:31|C|Har|Okay. Page 311, at about 202 hours and 37 minutes, if you want to turn to that.
150:09:47|T|CMP|Okay. Let's do that. That'll save copying an awful lot, I think.
150:09:53|C|Har|Okay. You want to look at that right now? I got one small change.
150:10:02|T|CMP|Well, I almost got it. The old - Oh, wait a minute. You - What page did you give me?
150:10:15|C|Har|Page 311. It's 202 hours and 40 minutes.
150:10:21|T|CMP|Ah so. It's the same volume I'm in. We passed the other volume and I went back for that. Okay. All right, 311. You're ahead of me. Okay, I got it.
150:10:37|C|Har|Okay, this is the only bistatic we gonna do. Start where it says, "Configure comm" and end where it says, "S-Band Antenna, High Gain, Manual, Wide." And the only change in there is that the VHF antenna should be "Left" instead of "Right." We're in a different attitude.
150:11:04|T|CMP|Okay. I start where it says, "Configure comm for S-band." And I stop where - including, I assume, the high gain settings.
150:11:13|C|Har|Negative. We got different high gain settings -
150:11:15|T|CMP|... VHF antenna left instead of right. Okay. You got different high gains. All right; thank you.
150:11:24|C|Har|Okay. If you'll turn back down to 151, I'll give you that high gain. It's "Pitch, 20 - plus 20; YAW, 209.
150:11:39|T|CMP|Okay. That's "Pitch, plus 20; Yaw, 209.
150:11:44|C|Har|Roger. And verify the DSE as "Low Bit Rate, Forward, Forward, Command Reset.
150:11:53|T|CMP|Okay. We'll verify "Low Bit Rate" and recording.
150:12:02|C|Har|Okay. And on that same page where it says "CSM -
150:12:04|T|CMP|You want me to verify or do you want me to configure?
150:12:11|C|Har|Configure.
150:12:16|T|CMP|I say, do you want me to verify that DSE or do you want me to configure?
150:12:21|C|Har|Configure, Ken.
150:12:26|T|CMP|Okay.
150:12:29|C|Har|Okay. Right under that about 151:02, delete all that - that block about the lunar horizon. In other words, starting with the little block with CSM checklist all through - right on down through "Set Omni D.
150:12:46|T|CMP|Okay. That's all deleted.
150:12:49|C|Har|At 51:10, "P00." And following that, "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open.
150:13:06|T|CMP|Okay. At 151:10, we go to "P00" and "Alpha/X-Ray Cover, Open.
150:13:10|C|Har|At 151:20, "Verb 49 maneuver to bistatic attitude." And that attitude is "221, 138, 000.
150:13:32|T|CMP|Okay. At 151:20, we go "Verb 49 to bistatic; attitude, 221, 138, 000.
150:13:42|C|Har|All right. Delete the UV photo pad block. Delete the acquire MSFN and all that stuff there - the lunar horizon, that comment. At 151:30, next page -
150:14:05|T|CMP|Okay.
150:14:07|C|Har|And write small. "P20, Option 2. Noun 78, plus 270.00, minus 040.63.
150:14:30|T|CMP|Boy, Hank. That comm is just terrible.
150:14:32|C|Har|Okay. We're having trouble in here, Ken. Everybody is yelling and hollering. We'll get them quieted down.
150:14:43|C|Har|Okay, repeat. "Noun 78 is plus 270.00, minus 040.63. Noun 79, minus 0.0830, plus 000.50. Noun 34, plus 00.151, plus 0.0034, plus all zips.
150:15:31|T|CMP|Okay. That says at 151:30, we go "P20, option 2. Noun 78 is plus 270.00 and minus 040.63. Noun 79, minus 0.0830, plus 000.50. Noun 34 is 151, 34, 00.
150:16:00|C|Har|That's correct, Ken. And as you can probably deduce from the Noun 34, right at 151:34, you should say "Start pitch rate." And the attitude for that is "221, 114 underlined slash 138, 000.
150:16:32|T|CMP|Okay. That's - that sounds reasonable. Let me ask you one question about this antenna. I've got a - a little discrepancy between the - the set knobs that I have and the feedback read-outs that I get off the instrument panel. This is on the high gain settings.
150:16:57|C|Har|Roger.
150:16:58|T|CMP|Can anyone tell me if it matters which I use, and which one I should use if it matters.
150:17:03|C|Har|Okay, I'll get that answered while I read you the next.
150:17:10|T|CMP|Okay. Read on.
150:17:12|C|Har|Okay. Delete the rest of the things on that page.
150:17:24|T|CMP|Okay.
150:17:25|C|Har|And, from - next page, 152 to 152:30, delete all of that.
150:17:40|T|CMP|Okay.
150:17:42|C|Har|Next page, 152:30. Delete everything down to where it says "GDC align" at about 152:52.
150:18:02|T|CMP|Okay.
150:18:04|C|Har|And at - back up at 152:41, out to the side there, you can write it - add "P00, discontinue Bistatic Radar. VHF Range, Off; VHF A and B, Off." And then "Return your S-Band Mode Ranging to Ranging.
150:18:44|T|CMP|Okay. At 152:40, you go to "P00, discontinue the Bistatic, VHF Range, Off; VHF A and B, Off; S-Band Mode to Ranging.
150:18:56|C|Har|Roger. And at 152:53, you'll pick up the nominal Flight Plan again. And at - Go to the top of the next page up there, at 153:00. That experiment status code now should be "Minus all 1s and 01222.
150:19:25|T|CMP|Okay.
150:19:38|C|Har|At 153:15, delete the "Mass Spec, Ion Source, On." It's already On.
150:19:47|T|CMP|All right.
150:19:57|C|Har|And, Ken, back up at the top - at 153 even, right at the top of the page, "Configure DSE to High Bit Rate, Command Reset.
150:20:17|T|CMP|Okay. "Configure DSE, High Bit Rate, Command Reset" at 153 even.
150:20:24|C|Har|And I think that's all of it.
150:20:31|T|CMP|Okay. I guess the thing that seems to me like it might be missing here is where you're gonna get - Well, you've got me setting my DSE to high bit rate over here at 153. I guess we'll get some of that, won't we? Because we - we've had it running with no dump -
150:20:56|C|Har|Roger. We've been running in low bit rate.
150:20:58|T|CMP|- ... side, and I didn't stop the bistatic until after - That's right - low bit rate - but I didn't stop the bistatic until after LOS. So you're gonna get about half of this in low bit rate and about half of it in high. Okay?
150:21:12|C|Har|Roger.
150:21:16|T|CMP|I - I guess I got it straight.
150:21:51|C|Har|Okay, Ken. I got some more words on that question you had about - where I said verify the DSE with the bistatic. That should be - should be "verify" rather than "configure.
150:22:07|T|CMP|Okay. Let me see where that is now. Okay, that's at 151. That's "verify.
150:22:13|C|Har|Roger. Because you're going to configure it here at LOS. And the word is on the - the high gain angles, believe your meter.
150:22:24|T|CMP|Okay. I'll use the meters.
150:22:28|C|Har|And some more on this configure. We're coming up here on LOS. Apparently, it's important that the DSE be configured on a - a time. It depends on when they start to rewind. So for this rev, they want you to configure the DSE at 150:45.
150:22:54|T|CMP|Okay. 150:45 as opposed to 43. All righty.
150:23:40|C|Har|And, Ken, I got one more thing for you, a TEI pad, a block data.
150:23:51|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by while I get my other book.
150:24:24|T|CMP|Okay. I'm ready to copy.
150:24:25|C|Har|Okay, Ken. And to let you know what's going on here, we were going to give you a TEI-54 pad, and they're jockeying around - and - because of the plane change. And the plane change is gonna come about 169 hours. So they're gonna give you a TEI-48 pad now, and give you a TEI-55 pad at about 164 hours. So this'll be TEI-48, SPS/G&amp;N; 38620; plus 0.59, plus 1.25; 168 -
150:25:16|T|CMP|Hank, I - I can't hear you again. How about asking - asking the comm guy downstairs if he can patch it differently or something. It hasn't sounded like this until just the last - oh, I've been noticing it the last couple of revs, but this thing - I can't even understand you.
150:25:47|C|Har|Ken, how do you read now?
150:25:53|T|CMP|Well, that little burst was good, Hank.
150:25:55|C|Har|Okay, let's try it again. There's been a lot of noise in the room -
150:26:01|T|CMP|No, you're getting drowned out again.
150:26:17|C|Har|Okays Ken. We'll try it again -
150:26:18|T|CMP|Hanks it sounds just like the other loops are -
150:26:26|C|Har|Can you read me all right now, Ken?
150:26:35|T|CMP|No, I can't, Hank. It's - it's - Unkey your mike a second. Let me tell you what it sounds like. It - it sounds like that we've got the other loop - the other air-to-ground or the Flight Director's loop or something like that that's got a Vox key that comes on, and I don't hear it when you make a short statement. But when you're on for - and hold it down for any length of time, then all this other talking comes on, and it sounds like I can probably hear Tony and I'm not sure who all else. Nothing is very clear. It is exceptionally noisy, and it just sounds like - sounds like trying to hold a conversation in a football game - is what it sounds like. And it's been - it's been annoying, but now it's getting to the place where I can't even read you.
150:27:25|C|Har|Okays it - it must be coming from somewhere else, Ken. We've got everybody in the room real quiet now.
150:27:34|T|CMP|Yeah, I - I don't think it's possible (laughter) for all that noise to be coming through from your open mike. That's the reason I wanted to see if Comm Tech could chase it out or something.
150:27:48|C|Har|Okay. We're about 2 minutes from LOS. I don't guess we're going to be able to get this pad to you, and we're not going to see you for another rev, about 3 hours.
150:28:00|T|CMP|Okay. Well, I'm not gonna - I'm not gonna burn TEI-48 in the meantime, anyhow. But I can't - I'm not gonna copy you properly if I can't hear you.
150:28:12|C|Har|Okay. We'll work on this thing and see if we can't have it better when we get comm here in a rev and a half.
150:28:21|T|CMP|All right. Thank you very much, Hank.
150:28:23|C|Har|Do you - do you still have the noise while we're talking now?
150:28:29|T|CMP|Yes, sir. It doesn't come on immediately as soon as you start to talk. It - it builds up slowly, like you start to talk and then it takes about 1001, 1002, and then it comes on like a big rush. And it just swells up and after a couple of seconds, you're completely drowned out.
150:28:51|C|Har|Okay. It must be in the lines. They're checking now.
150:28:57|T|CMP|All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
150:29:10|T|CMP|And I promise we won't go anywhere in the meantime.

153:15:31|C|Roo|Hello, Casper; Houston. Standing by.
153:15:42|T|CMP|Hello, there. How are you doing?
153:15:46|C|Roo|Oh, I'm pressing along. Ken, we'd like - we saw some funnies on our - on that bistatic, and I'd like to verify the position of the VHF antenna.
153:15:59|T|CMP|It was in the Left position.
153:16:01|C|Roo|Okay. That takes care of that question.
153:16:33|C|Roo|And, Ken, awhile ago you were reporting loud background noise. We'd like to ask you how the comm is now.
153:16:43|T|CMP|Sounds great.
153:16:47|C|Roo|Okay.
153:16:48|T|CMP|What did you do?
153:16:52|C|Roo|We asked you what the comm was, and that fixed it.
153:17:05|C|Roo|And, Ken, any time you're ready, I've got some Flights Plan updates. We lied to you while ago when I said we were through for the day. And I've got a TEI-48 pad.
153:17:25|T|CMP|Okay. Why don't you give me the Flight Plan first.
153:17:29|C|Roo|All right. Let's go to 154:30.
153:17:36|T|CMP|All righty.
153:17:37|C|Roo|Okay; and the reason why we're doing this is the cabin is coming up a little bit and we're going to open the waste stowage vent valve for approximately an hour. So at 154:30, we're adding "Waste Stowage Vent valve, open.
153:18:02|T|CMP|Okay. I guess I'm just not breathing hard enough, huh?
153:18:07|C|Roo|Oh, man, just great metabolism there. And over at 155:30, we can add "Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed.
153:18:27|T|CMP|Okay. "Waste Stowage Vent, Closed" at 155:30.
153:18:31|C|Roo|Okays, that will be one step off your pre-sleep checklist there, see. And after the pre-sleep checklist, we'd like to add "Accept VHF." And what we're gonna do here is get you configured for the VHF bistatic test during your sleep period, so disregard the VHF part of your pre-sleep. And at 155 -
153:18:56|T|CMP|You want to give me a complete -
153:18:58|C|Roo|Yeah, we can do that. The time on that is 155:36 and you've got about six or seven lines; you might want to come out to the left there.
153:19:12|T|CMP|Okay, all set.
153:19:16|C|Roo|Okay. And there at 36, we'll delete the two steps, the one with the VHF that you see, the "VHF AM T/R, Receive (Panel 9)" and delete the "VHF AM A, Duplex." And then add Configure for VHF bistatic test, VHF AM T/R, three, to Receive (verify). VHF AM A, Off (verify). VHF AM B, Duplex (verify)." And "VHF Range to Range. And VHF Antenna, Right." And also right, all at the same time, Ken, right here around 155:35, we'd like to - Didn't leave you much room to write - we'd like to configure for a 2&frac12 degree deadband test. So at 155:35, we'd like "CMC, Free; P20, Noun 79, plus 00250," and then we'll go back to "Auto." Well, are you still with me, Ken, or did I leave you back on the waste stowage vent valve.
153:21:43|T|CMP|Let's see. I guess the last thing I heard was "Are you there." (Laughter)
153:21:48|C|Roo|Yeah. Houston standing by.
153:21:54|T|CMP|Right (laughter). And at about 155:30, we go to Free, take P20 and narrow the deadband to 2&frac12 degrees, then go back to Auto. We take the VHF, verify VHF panels are all three to Receive. We take the VHF AM A, Off, the VHF AM B to Duplex, the Ranging to Range, and the Antenna to Right.
153:22:32|C|Roo|Okay, and you, you're not going to do anything in the pre-sleep checklist with the VHF, because we've just given you all these others, and you deleted those two steps that were in there.
153:22:40|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
153:22:42|C|Roo|Okay. Now let's go over to 164:10, which you'll see in the morning.
153:23:04|T|CMP|Okay, 164:10.
153:23:06|C|Roo|Okay, we'd like to add "Terminate VHF bistatic test. VHF AM B, Off," and "VHF Ranging, Off.
153:23:33|T|CMP|Okay. Terminate the bistatic at 164:10, VHF AM B, Off, and Range, Off.
153:23:41|C|Roo|Okay, and that's all the Flight Plan updates for tonight as of this moment.
153:23:51|T|CMP|You've got to be kidding.
153:23:54|C|Roo|Unh-unh. I've been known to lie, though.
153:24:00|T|CMP|(Laughter) You sure have. Hey, you mentioned something yesterday about the general scheme of things to come.
153:24:08|C|Roo|That's right.
153:24:10|T|CMP|Is that still sort of on tap?
153:24:14|C|Roo|Yeah, that's it pretty much. I thought somewhere along this pass we'd give you a little more detail, Specifically, on what we'd be doing tomorrow, and maybe give you times of PC1 and lift-off and so forth.
153:24:32|T|CMP|Okay. I got to thinking about it some last night, and the one thing I thought about is - I understand the desire to keep the day down to some reasonable number. If we still have to put our suits on to jettison the LM the next day, that's gonna chew up quite a few hours. And if that doesn't make any difference, why that's okay, if there's nothing else for us to do during those hours. But it seems like that's - to take those suits off and then put them back on and take them off again, with three guys in here it becomes a real big operation. I guess that sort of, would seem to me, might be an option that maybe John would have an opinion on when he gets back tomorrow.
153:25:37|C|Roo|Okay. We copy that, Ken. just stand by a minute.
153:25:43|T|CMP|Okay. I'm not proposing you change it. I'm just suggesting you consider the big flap that goes on when three guys have to suit up in here.
153:25:55|C|Roo|Yeah, I guess. We're certainly aware of that, Ken, and the name of the game on this one is going to be dock with the LM and transfer across with just a minimum transfer, bring the rock boxes and your suits and the box, and that's about it. And then the next day, complete the LM transfer and so forth. The name of the game is to get to bed. And that's why the decision is made that way.
153:26:28|T|CMP|Okay. All right. That's just fine then.
153:26:38|C|Roo|Yeah, they've pretty well set a limit here that we're aiming at, Ken, and that's an 18-hour day, considering the EVAs and your long day. So that's about the only way it would work.
153:26:56|T|CMP|Okay.
153:27:16|C|Roo|And along that way tomorrow - we'll of course have the update for you later, but we are going to have to schedule a urine dump with the mass spec. So we'll get that.
153:27:31|T|CMP|Okay.
153:27:50|T|CMP|And you got Power and Standby on the Pan Camera.
153:27:56|C|Roo|Okay.
153:27:58|T|CMP|Gamma Ray Shield is Off.
153:28:01|C|Roo|Okay.
153:28:06|T|CMP|And you said you wanted to give me a pad of some sort. Let me find a place to write that.
153:28:08|C|Roo|It'll be a little TEI-48 pad.
153:28:29|T|CMP|Okay, that's what Hank was starting to give me when we bombed out last time.
153:28:32|C|Roo|That's affirmative.
153:28:37|T|CMP|Okay. All set, go ahead.
153:28:41|C|Roo|Okay. That'll be TEI-48, SPS/G&amp;N; 38620; plus 0.59, plus 1.25; 168:51:56.94; plus 3052.2, plus 0704.2, minus 0137.4; 182, 117, 014. The rest of the pad NA. Comments: the GDC align same as for circ; ullage, two jets, 17 seconds; longitude at T minus 172.00. Additional comments.
153:30:07|T|CMP|Okay, go ahead.
153:30:10|C|Roo|Pad based on loading site REFSMMAT, assumed no plane change.
153:30:18|T|CMP|All righty, that's TEI-48, SPS/G&amp;N; 38620; plus 0.59, plus 1.25; 168:51:56.94; plus 3052.2, plus 0704.2, minus 0137.4; 182, 117, 014; GDC alignment goes with the circ pad, two jets, 17 seconds. Lambda ignition, minus 172.00. Pad is based on the descent REFSMMAT, and no plane change.
153:31:00|C|Roo|Okay, that sounds like a good readback. We got that beauty in.
153:31:25|C|Roo|And, Ken, we'd like Pan Camera Power, Off, now.
153:31:31|T|CMP|Okay. Pan Camera Power's coming Off. And it's Off now.
153:31:36|C|Roo|Okay.
153:31:56|T|CMP|I got a chance to go back and look at the telescope on one of the last two revs, and found out the problem was that even after I had gone back and taped the eyepieces back on, they still had the tape on them, but the darned things had slipped out of focus with the telescope. And I guess it was far enough out of focus that it - the stars just weren't bright enough to show up. Because while I was sitting there looking in it I could focus it and then the stars would appear and disappear if I defocused it. So I refocused the eyepiece and the telescope works like you'd expect a telescope to work.
153:32:37|C|Roo|That little bit of troubleshooting sounds like another first for 16.
153:32:51|T|CMP|Well, I never would have thought about that thing coming off if I hadn't found the eyepiece floating by me one day.
153:32:59|C|Roo|Oh, now why did you blow your image.
153:33:25|T|CMP|What are the surface guys doing now - are they cleaning up after the EVA?
153:33:32|C|Roo|Roger. They're going through their cleanup, and they've had their debriefing, and I guess they're looking for them to try and be asleep in a couple of hours, or something like that.
153:33:47|T|CMP|Good show. How long was the EVA today? Seven and a half?
153:33:55|C|Roo|It was close to that, Ken, 07:23.
153:34:03|T|CMP|Oh, that's pretty good. Guess the little Rover did a good job.
153:34:10|C|Roo|Yeah, it, I didn't -
153:34:11|T|CMP|Hank just told me they found their way up to Cinco.
153:34:14|C|Roo|Yeah. I didn't get a chance to watch too much of that, but I did see one, when they were up on the southern point, they put the camera out on South Ray and it was just magnificent.
153:34:33|T|CMP|Oh. Save those tapes, I'd like to see that.
153:35:34|T|CMP|What kind of funny did you notice on the bistatic? Was it just not getting any VHF signal?
153:35:44|C|Roo|Well, we didn't have it initially, and then some of the words I heard was that we were getting a signal but it was not reflecting properly. And then we picked it up somewhere passing over the landing site and got some data. So I guess I'll have to get a better recap of - of that pass, but I guess - I guess the signal was there but just - just not hitting the right reflecting point.
153:36:20|T|CMP|Well, I'm just impressed that you can bounce a signal off the Moon that's as weak as this one and catch it back at Earth anyhow.
153:36:29|C|Roo|Yeah, and it's really not much of a switch, Ken, because we're going to run it through the night here anyway.
153:36:42|T|CMP|Okay. Hey, when I turn the waste vent on for an hour here, would it - would it make any difference to the mass spec people or anyone like that if I plugged in the black bag for a few minutes?
153:37:07|C|Roo|Stand by.
153:39:40|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, we have a Go from all hands to vent the bag.
153:39:47|T|CMP|Okay. We do appreciate that.
153:39:52|C|Roo|Roger.
153:40:23|T|CMP|What's your prognosis on the Pan Camera? Is it getting us any good data, or is it gonna be kind of sloppy?
153:40:40|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, we're - as I mentioned yesterday, it looks like we're overexposing about one f-stop, and there's a lot of, you know - we'll take that out in the processing, and everybody feels like the data is real good.
153:40:59|T|CMP|Outstanding.
153:43:51|C|Roo|And, Ken, as you whip by the site over there, if we could get you to put the Gamma Ray Shield on Center.
153:44:02|T|CMP|Okay. Do you want it now?
153:44:05|C|Roo|That's affirm.
153:44:06|T|CMP|Or did you want me to wait? Okay, here it comes.
153:44:11|C|Roo|Sorry about that.
153:44:14|T|CMP|It's on now.
153:44:15|C|Roo|Okay.
153:45:34|T|CMP|I was looking at the little dark halo craters around Mädler, and the one that's directly to the - yeah - east of Mädler has white streaks in it. I guess that's fair if - If light craters can bare dark streaks, I guess dark craters ought to be able to have light streaks in them. I don't know what that means to anybody.
153:46:01|C|Roo|Copy. That seems fair.
153:49:26|T|CMP|Here's a little beauty that's just - just to the south of the landing site. It's off a big tall dome, and it's got all this - a great white rayed crater in the top of it.
153:49:47|T|CMP|I'm looking at North Ray now, and it seems to me that that stuff that runs up on the North Ray comes right around the corner. It comes from out in the area back behind what we used to call the -
153:51:18|T|CMP|Just as I was coming up on the landing site that time, I saw this - little, very soft dome sitting up, and it's got this bright white ray crater right in the top of it. It's just like a - the crater itself looks like South Ray, and the - except it's built up on top of this nice little dome. And I don't know if that's coincidental, or what, but it sure is an interesting thing. The crater is about a third the size of the dome itself.
153:52:00|C|Roo|Roger. Copy.
153:52:22|C|Roo|And, Ken, have you been mumbling any geologic terms to yourself the last couple of passes?
153:52:32|T|CMP|No, sir. I - during that bistatic, I just kept quiet inside, too.
153:52:40|C|Roo|Okay. How were things around on the other side?
153:52:42|T|CMP|That was a good chance for me to - Yeah, that was a good chance for me to - to get caught up on all the housekeeping and loose ends, and kind of pick up some stuff here and there. That was a - a well needed break.
153:53:02|C|Roo|I certainly agree.
153:54:21|T|CMP|Hey, you know, looking down at this - this material that's to the north of Albatregius - Albategnius, that is - excuse me. That material, if you didn't have all these craters around it, that terrain scene could have been placed on the back side almost anywhere. Got exactly the same characteristics as the scene - everything about it's the same as a big share of what we call Cayley and other stuff.
153:54:59|C|Roo|Okay.
153:55:03|T|CMP|And the Cayley floor fill I see in Ptolemaeus. And all of these things look exactly like what you see in Mendeleev. I've been looking for something I could say was different. I don't see a thing.
153:55:20|C|Roo|Okay. That sounds like a good observation.
153:55:49|T|CMP|Look at Alphonsus. I'm looking at the eastern or the dark gray craters, the one that's almost due east of the central peak, the largest ring deposit there. And to the unaided eye, it stands out quite dramatically. When I put the binoculars on it, the difference is extremely subtle. You really have to look for it, and then it just turns out to be a slightly different color, but I can't say anything at all about any difference in textures or any other thing that's different except that there's a slightly different color to it. But it's more obvious to the unaided eye than it is to the eye with magnification.
153:56:42|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. I guess what you're trying to say is when you get too close to the forest you can't see the trees, huh?
153:56:57|T|CMP|That must be.
154:01:17|T|CMP|Looks like most of these medium-size craters out here in Cognitum are - they have raised rims, but they're very smooth raised rims, and they kind of - they have a convex instead of a concave side to them. It's - very much like the little suspected cone we saw next to Lassell C. It's just that he's by himself out there, and as you get into Cognitum you see quite a few that look just like that.
154:01:48|C|Roo|By Jove. We got that, Ken.
154:02:57|T|CMP|Okay. Maybe we could have drawn a terminator that was a little more over towards the area where we've shown our target, but there may be quite a drop-off in elevation here. It would only take - quite a bit, to the Sun angle wouldn't have to be an awful lot, on a geologic scale I guess. But the actual terminator was running down just to the west of Le Alda [or Mädler?] so I ran a strip down that.
154:03:32|C|Roo|Okay. We got that. You want to give us the frame number while you got it handy.
154:03:40|T|CMP|Okay. Good show. How about 84? [It is not clear which film magazine Ken is referring to here.]
154:03:45|C|Roo|Okay; 84.
154:08:54|C|Roo|And, Casper; Houston.
154:08:59|T|CMP|Go ahead.
154:09:02|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, as far as tomorrow, you've got a full schedule of the SIM Bay and visuals and landmark tracking and so forth, I'm sure you don't want the details now. Would you be interested in the times of PC-1, lift-off and -
154:09:23|T|CMP|Yeah. Let me get my - let me get my little scratch pad out here and let you give a kind of a summary - of major events anyhow.
154:09:50|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
154:09:52|C|Roo|Well, I don't want to - the first part of the day I really don't want to try to get into any details, Ken. It's - it's your standard P20 with a lot of Mapping Camera/Pan Cameras, and all the sensors we got - we got going. You're going to burn plane change 1 at 169 plus 40. That's - that's approximate times. And LM lift-off is approximately 175 plus 50. And I guess ... one in the middle there, too. Your - your landmark tracking will come at about 173:20, something in - in that order. And after docking - we're showing you -
154:10:44|T|CMP|Hey, that's landmark on the LM?
154:10:46|C|Roo|That's the landing site landmark.
154:10:50|T|CMP|Okay.
154:10:56|C|Roo|And we'd like to have Auto on the High Gain.
154:11:00|T|CMP|Right, you've got it.
154:11:01|C|Roo|Okay. And then as I said before after - after docking, at - at this time, we're showing you an hour and 30 minutes for the transfer. And then you'll come inside, have an eat period, and hopefully start the rest period. And your rest period will start at about -
154:11:20|T|CMP|Okay ...
154:11:23|C|Roo|- 100 - and start at about 181:30, in that area, will be the rest period.
154:11:32|T|CMP|Okay. And the day starts about 164, was it?
154:11:35|C|Roo|That's affirmative. Around 164.
154:11:48|T|CMP|Okay. That's not so bad.
154:12:00|C|Roo|No. The way you've been swinging along up there doing all that good work, you'll just romp through that.
154:12:17|T|CMP|Well, I'll tell you, it was - it was kind of nice to just sit back and have that bistatic pass to catch up on all the things you've been putting off.
154:12:29|C|Roo|Yes. I know what you mean.
154:12:42|T|CMP|Okay, and since you reminded me of film, let me give you the - what I got on this DAC magazine too while I take it down. That'll save asking about it later. I have a - a feeling we may be quite a ways behind on our film status. Magazine II has - that'd be 20 - that's looks to me like 42 percent.
154:13:10|C|Roo|Okay. I copy. II, Item Item, and 42.0 percent.
154:13:18|T|CMP|... yeah.
154:13:22|C|Roo|And I made it your last.
154:13:24|T|CMP|That's quite a bit off from the prediction. I wonder if I - I turned it on at the right time, and I turned it off at the right time.
154:13:49|C|Roo|Oh, I don't know, Ken. That's - that's within 18 percent.
154:13:54|T|CMP|(Laughter)
154:15:04|C|Roo|And, Ken, the word here is that they're not concerned about that percentage, just as long as you photograph the old mass spec.
154:15:17|T|CMP|Well, we photographed something that was pointed in that direction.
154:15:21|C|Roo|The - the bracket didn't break off, did it?
154:15:23|T|CMP|We took lots of photographs of it, whatever it was. (Laughter) No, I got worried, I knocked it once, and -
154:15:33|C|Roo|Well, if you dropped it, I'd of worried about the heat shield.
154:15:36|T|CMP|It is unbelievable. (Laughter) Well, I started to say I was worried about the spacecraft.
154:15:57|T|CMP|Probably get the pictures back and find that it has a natural frequency that's the same as the camera.
154:16:08|C|Roo|That's why they made it so big.
154:16:12|T|CMP|(Laughter) That thing wouldn't even vibrate on a Saturn V.
154:16:46|T|CMP|I think the part I liked most about this experiment was Chris Printer's [?] little window shade.
154:16:59|T|CMP|It worked just fine, and it couldn't be simpler.
154:18:55|C|Roo|Yeah, Ken, it - you know - we talked about a couple of little pitfalls there, you know, of going to CMC control with the SCS - I mean with the Optics switch in Manual and that type thing, and we would like to go through your procedures and stick in a couple of steps that would result, you know, in that wrong procedure. Now, as far as the details on where you put your SCS switches and so forth, I've got a starting plan worked out. I don't know how much detail you want on that - on that sort of thing or just turn you loose and try to do it in SCS.
154:19:40|T|CMP|Oh, I'll take all the thoughts that you got, Stu.
154:19:43|C|Roo|Okay. We'll - we'll probably give you those on your - we will give you those on your next time around so you can cogitate on them.
154:19:55|T|CMP|Okay.
154:20:07|T|CMP|I'd hardly be the Government's hero if I over-torqued my Dukesons [?] on the rendezvous.
154:20:17|C|Roo|Well, that's - that's the one thing you've always got to watch out for. That and Check 6.
154:20:38|C|Roo|And, Ken, a reminder on your Waste Stowage Vent valve.
154:20:45|T|CMP|Gee, thank you. Is it that time? It sure is.
154:22:03|C|Roo|Ken, have you got any bright planets in your view in that double umbra? Isn't that something - really a beautiful sight, isn't it?
154:26:06|C|Roo|And, Casper, we're about 2 minutes to LOS, and we'll see you on the other side.
155:14:23|C|Roo|Casper, Houston standing by.
155:14:29|T|CMP|Hello there.
155:14:32|C|Roo|Greetings.
155:15:38|C|Roo|Well, how did old Kohlschuetter look, Ken?
155:15:45|T|CMP|Like a big mountain.
155:15:50|C|Roo|Ah so.
155:15:52|T|CMP|This is one of these things where that - that strip was planned for the - the ground track post plane change. And, of course, we were further south at the time than was intended, so it didn't fit very well. It was really scrunched up in the corner. I don't know whether that's really going to be any help or not. But there is - Try it and maybe it'll come out okay.
155:16:25|C|Roo|There can't be any bad pictures of the Moon.
155:16:32|T|CMP|(Laughter) That's right. When you've got nothing, a little goes a long ways.
155:16:41|C|Roo|Okay. We're about to wind it down, Ken. Only two things I have for you is to go over the rendezvous procedures and I'll let you get on through your pre-sleep checklist and - and wipe it out for the day.
155:17:05|T|CMP|Sounds like a good plan. Why don't we go through your - your little plan first?
155:17:14|C|Roo|Okay. If you're ready, go over to 171:40 and you'll have your pro - procedures there.
155:17:29|T|CMP|Okay, 100 and let's - 140 - let's see, before I get over there, you want me to - Oh, you'll remind me to come back to the shift the deadband. Okay. Okay, I'm at 171:40.
155:17:49|C|Roo|Okay. And in that space in between that update and the LM lift-off is a nice place to write. Let's put in there first, "Optics Mode, CMC, verify." Underneath that, let's write a note. "Spacecraft Control must be in SCS prior to Optics Mode, Manual." I'm just reminding you of the note that - that we passed on the other night, Ken.
155:18:32|T|CMP|That's just fine.
155:18:33|C|Roo|Okay. And then come on down after LM lift-off, and where you have P34, delete the "CMC Mode, Hold." And delete the next line, "Set Noun 79," et cetera. Okay, and we'd like to add in here, and it will be four lines, so you might start out kind of small, "Spacecraft Control, SCS; BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2.
155:19:32|C|Roo|All righty. And then, next line, "Attitude Deadband, Max; Rate, Low; and Limit Cycle, On." That's all on that page.
155:19:56|T|CMP|Okay. Let me read that back to you, then. Between the update and lift-off, I've got "Optics Mode to SMC, verify." And the note that "Spacecraft Control must be in SCS prior to Optics Mode going to Manual. Following lift-off, next to the Verb 88, "Spacecraft Control, SCS; BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/ Rate 2; Deadband, Max; Limit Cycle, On; and Rate, Low.
155:20:22|C|Roo|Okay, that's affirmative.
155:20:40|C|Roo|Okay. Go to the next page, Ken.
155:20:45|T|CMP|All set.
155:20:49|C|Roo|Okay. Down here at 172:10, delete "CMC Mode Auto.
155:21:01|T|CMP|Okay.
155:21:02|C|Roo|Okay, now, Ken. This is just a couple of words on dealer's choice. Now as you recall from running this in your attitude, right here at about 172:13, your trunion is down through about 22 degrees. And, of course, there you were going Auto. Now they tell me the way you had been flying the SCS rendezvous, that you'd just stay in an Att Hold and let the trunion. If you want to here, you could put the Pitch BMAG to Rate 2 and just bang it once. But I - I'm not gonna give you any - any changes of Flight Plan on that. That's just your option on how you want to keep the trunion angle.
155:21:43|T|CMP|Okay. I'll write a note here to watch for that, at that point.
155:21:47|C|Roo|Yeah, your trunion will be - if you're right on nominal - will be 22 degrees right around - oh, somewhere in the order of 172:12 there.
155:22:08|C|Roo|Okay, and then down at the bottom there, prior to - in between the "MSFN disables" and the "P34 final comp," I want you to write in, "Optics Mode, CMC." And this is just a reminder.
155:22:36|T|CMP|Okay, between "MSFN disables" and "final comp," we'll write in, "Optics Mode to CMC." I've added the note at the top - at 172:10 - to watch for trunion increasing greater than 22 and BMAG, at least the Pitch one, can go to Rate and give it a blip.
155:22:58|C|Roo|Okay, that's just - that's just one way of doing it, and it - it works real good and it does not take a large rate in there, just - just about 1 or 2 at the most of what would be a minimum impulse fire.
155:23:17|T|CMP|Okay, the only reason I had been using Att Hold before was because we were simulating loss of - of the IMU; and, in that case, I wanted to use the attitude gyros because they had less drift. And it made the marking simpler; but, in this case, I might as well let it - give it a burp and let it track along.
155:23:37|C|Roo|Okay, that's the way I ran them and the - the line of sight rates are - are pretty low, and it's just sort of one of these no-sweat things. Just about one fast blip and then it - it just hangs right there.
155:23:55|T|CMP|Very good.
155:23:56|C|Roo|Okay, and you've got your Optics Mode, CMC, down here toward the bottom. We'll turn the page.
155:24:05|T|CMP|All right, I'm with you.
155:24:10|C|Roo|Okay, now, Ken, here's - It - This gets kind of messy through here so you might try to write small. And the only thing we're trying to do is, of course, get into P40 and take the auto maneuver, set up for the SCS burn, get back into track attitude, and then back to SCS. And the way we'll do that is we'll take the first line, "Cycle CMC Mode, Free, Auto," and delete it.
155:24:46|T|CMP|Okay.
155:24:48|C|Roo|Okay. And then, after P40, write "Spacecraft Control, CMC." And next line, "BMAG Mode, parenthesis 3, Rate 2." And I want to make a note there, Ken. I mean this is not for you to write down, unless you want to, but you'll be tracking along here, and you might be a little out of the preferred track attitude. And if you go into Spacecraft Control to CMC before you get to the burn program, the CMC will try to take you back to the preferred attitude, and you're just wasting an RCS maneuver. So wait until after you're in the burn program to go to CMC, and that's - that's true also of P41 for the mid-courses.
155:25:43|T|CMP|Okay, that's a good note.
155:25:48|C|Roo|Okay, and down here where it says "SPS checklist," we're deleting that only because your SPS cue card is - is marked up so bad. And so, the - the reason why - Let's - let's at least say you don't use the cue card as written, which you wouldn't, but we just want to make that point. And in the space in there between "Compare solution in TPI," I've got three lines for you. The first one is, "Spacecraft Control, SCS, after auto manoeuvre." The next line is, and here again this is sort of superfluous, but it's "BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2." And then, just to sum it all up, could we add a note, "Use SCS burn procedures, if required.
155:27:07|C|Roo|And here again, I'll - this is not for you to write down null - unless you want to, Ken. It's a personal reminder that we talked about before, that, if you Enter on that 204 display before going to SCS, you have activated the - the relay.
155:27:29|T|CMP|Okay. I think I will just put another little note out here.
155:27:32|C|Roo|Okay.
155:27:46|T|CMP|Okay. If I am in SCS control, though, I can - I can afford to do an Enter on 204?
155:27:52|C|Roo|That's affirmative. If you're in SCS control, you have no power to that relay. It comes through the Spacecraft Control switch, and it -
155:28:01|T|CMP|Okay. That was my impression.
155:28:03|C|Roo|- and it must be in CMC, so you cannot get the activation of the relay as long as you're in SCS.
155:28:14|T|CMP|Okay.
155:28:15|C|Roo|All righty.
155:28:16|T|CMP|I can still have good navigation through the CMC.
155:28:23|C|Roo|That's - that's affirmative. You mean - you mean - you mean the navigation programs?
155:28:36|T|CMP|Onboard state vector, in the event that you did a burn?
155:28:40|C|Roo|Oh. What you want to do is - is go on into P40 and stay in P40, and then trim - trim your residuals under - out on the G&amp;N.
155:28:56|T|CMP|Roger. That's what I was - that's what I wanted to get at.
155:29:00|C|Roo|Yeah. And then here's -
155:29:01|T|CMP|The only thing I have to do is make the actual burn itself under SCS control.
155:29:06|C|Roo|What we want you to do is be in SCS control when you respond to that 204 display and make the burn in SCS. And now, here again, I'm going to bring up another little pitfall. You want - down after TPI, you want to wait until the flashing 16 85 comes up before you go back to CMC. Now, you know, TPI is a short burn and you could very well burn in SCS on time and have a 99 flashing up there. Go on, get through that, and get into your flashing 16 85 before you return the - the Spacecraft Control to CMC. At least, by that, is what I'm trying to say, Ken.
155:29:55|T|CMP|Okay.
155:29:57|C|Roo|Okay. And that summarizes my next line, it just was "Flashing 16 85," then "Spacecraft Control to CMC" and it was just trying to get across what I just told you in words; and, if you made the burn, why, null your residuals.
155:30:33|T|CMP|Okay. And the - if it's all nominal, there really shouldn't be any manoeuvre there at all for - to attitude for the first midcourse.
155:30:44|C|Roo|That - that's affirmative. It's - it's generally not. And what - the way the procedures show it, if you want to be technically correct is, prior to P35, reminding you of your BMAGs again - BMAG Mode, 3, to Rate 2. Then go ahead into P35 and - generally, I don't come up with a - with a greater-than-10-degree maneuver, but sometimes it - it dresses up the - the preferred track, there. So -
155:31:23|T|CMP|Roger.
155:31:24|C|Roo|Okay. Then after P35, we have "BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2 after manoeuvre.
155:31:49|T|CMP|Okay.
155:31:50|C|Roo|Okay. "Attitude Deadband, Max" is next line. And the next line after that is "Spacecraft Control to SCS." And if you want to write you down a little note beside that "Before Optics Manual.
155:32:33|T|CMP|Okay.
155:32:35|C|Roo|And stand by one - That's okay, Ken. Okay, let's come on down here to P35, and delete "Cycle CMC Mode, Free to Auto.
155:32:58|T|CMP|Okay.
155:32:59|C|Roo|Okay. And let's - Just before that P35 final comp, just because it's an easy place to write it, let's put it down "Optics Mode, CMC.
155:33:22|T|CMP|Okay. Got that.
155:33:24|C|Roo|Okay, then after P41, we'll put "Spacecraft Control, CMC." And now here, Ken, since it's - We never take the manoeuvre, but just to cover all cases on the - on the P41, after "Spacecraft Control, CMC," we can put down "BMAG MODE, 3, Rate 2," since we are running a little out of configuration.
155:34:08|T|CMP|Okay.
155:34:16|C|Roo|Okay. Then, Ken, after - after the Midcourse 1 through P76, P35, and we're just about through with these. We'll have "BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2 after manoeuvre." And the next line is "Spacecraft Control, SCS, before Optics, Manual." And that takes care of that page.
155:35:03|T|CMP|Okay.
155:35:06|C|Roo|All right. If you want to turn the page, we're just about home. Right before the P35 final comp, we'll put "Optics Mode, CMC." And after the P35 final comp, we'll delete the line, "Cycle CMC Mode, Free, Auto." And then after P41, "Spacecraft Control, CMC." And our last entry then, "BMAG Mode, 3, Rate 2." And that was a lot of talking, Ken, but that will keep the BMAGs where they're supposed to be and the relay where it's supposed to be.
155:36:20|T|CMP|And it was all worth it. Okay, suppose - suppose I read that all back to you?
155:36:28|C|Roo|Okay.
155:36:36|T|CMP|Okay, we already covered the -
155:36:40|C|Roo|Ken, about -
155:36:41|T|CMP|And I'll go to Attitude - Yes, go ahead.
155:36:43|C|Roo|Okay. Could we interrupt here before your readback, and we've got your jet-on monitor loads but - Stand by one. Yeah, what we'd like for you to do is go to the 2&frac12 degree deadband - there's that change that we had, and then they can be uplinking while you're reading back.
155:37:12|T|CMP|Okay, I'll do that. Just a second here.<br>
155:37:36|T|CMP|Okay, we're in the 2&frac12 degree deadband and you've got Accept.
155:37:40|C|Roo|Okay, jolly good, and I'm ready for the readback.
155:37:47|T|CMP|Okay, let me mark off what I did here. Okay, before lift-off, we'll end up with - making sure that the CMC has control of the optics; we'll fly with the CMC to the initial attitude, then we'll go to SCS Control; BMAGS, 3, Att 1/Rate 2; Max, Deadband; Limit Cycle, On; and Rate, Low. Then we'll do our initial tracking there. And we'll stay with that and 172:10 when the normal auto manoeuvres would be enabled, I - I'll probably take the Pitch BMAG to Rates and start a small rate in there.
155:38:45|C|Roo|Yeah, that'll be just one small blip.
155:38:51|T|CMP|Roger.
155:39:05|T|CMP|Okay, and just before the final comp on P34, we put the Optics Mode to CMC. Let the P34 finish and once I'm in P40, I give the Spacecraft Control to CMC; BMAGs, 3, to Rate 2; and accept the manoeuvre. When I'm in Attitude, I can go back and do SCS control; BMAGs, 3, Att 1/Rate 2; and, should a burn be required, I'll make an SCS auto burn. I'll null the G&amp;N residuals, still remaining in SCS control. I'll proceed past the Noun 85 before returning control to G&amp;N. And it'll be BMAGs, three, to RATE 2 when I get - I think the safest place is when I get in - all the way into P35. When I get it - there, I'll return Spacecraft Control to CMC and take the manoeuvre. Go back to SCS control; BMAGs, Att 1/Rate 2, all 3. Deadband, Max; then I'll take Spacecraft Control, SCS; and then Optics to Manual. Prior to the final comp, we go Optics Mode to CMC. Again, at P41, we'll hold Spacecraft Control to CMC, and I'll be bypassing the manoeuvre. And I - But if we - if we take the manoeuvre, it's BMAGs, 3 to Rate 2. Again, we'll proceed all the way through it; and, when I get into P35, I'll take the BMAGs back to Att 1/Rate 2; and give Spacecraft Control to SCS. Then, Optics to Manual. Same procedure for Midcourse 2, except that at the completion of Midcourse 2, why, I'll just stay in SCS - I mean, CMC.
155:41:23|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. Couple of comments there, now. I guess how you trim the residuals is sort of dealer's choice. Once you're in that flashing 16 85 display, why, you can go to CMC freely. So you can play that any way you want.
155:41:48|T|CMP|Okay, but I might just as well stay in SCS. That's a simpler - and one less number that I'm likely to confuse.
155:41:55|C|Roo|Okay, now let me - and your - your readback was - was okay. There is something now that I'll say - after the P35 where you have BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2; okay, if the - the CMC will start you on a good track rate; I just didn't want to get the procedures too clowned up; but, you know if you put your Pitch BMAG to Rate 2 there, before you go to SCS, you'll keep in your CMC track. Now you'll be below the rate at which you're maneuvreing, but you - between TPI and Midcourse 1, you'll exceed your - your attitude deadband. So, since you did say you were going to go - to go on the track method, people talked me out of when they said you always did the other one, but I think you should put a note in there, BMAG Roll and Yaw, Att 1/Rate 2, and Pitch BMAG to - I mean Roll and Yaw, Att 1/Rate 2 and leave your Pitch in Rate 2. Did all that talking make sense?
155:43:17|C|Roo|Okay. And that would also be true after the other P35.
155:43:28|T|CMP|Roger.
155:43:42|C|Roo|And just so we make sure that all procedures showing the same - I'm - I'm changing mine to show that, Ken.
155:43:51|T|CMP|Okay. I have mine changed, too.
155:44:12|C|Roo|Okay. And I think that's it. I thought before the rendezvous, we'd - we'd give you a swinging Delta tail off just for your weight even though you've got a chart. Just so you wouldn't have to do any figuring out. Of course, 11 is always a good number, but, just to be professional, we'll give you a good one - and since you are making an SCS burn.
155:44:42|T|CMP|Thank you. I was going to ask you for that. It's really not quite the same as if you had SCS only because you got the information there what's the right thing; but it sure helped to - be a lot cheaper about your RCS.
155:44:57|C|Roo|Roger. We might as well be professional about this whole show, since you're doing such a good job up there.
155:45:12|T|CMP|Hey, there's one other thing I was going to ask you. Yeah. About the Mapping Camera. Are we going to leave it out or we going to try and retract it?
155:45:22|C|Roo|Stand by.
155:45:40|C|Roo|Ken, the SIM Bay is configured for sleep. As of right now.
155:45:48|T|CMP|Oh, I'm sorry, I - I'm - I'm still thinking about rendezvous.
155:45:56|C|Roo|Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Stand by.
155:46:15|C|Roo|Okay, Ken, we're going to retract the camera for rendezvous, extend it again, and then we'll retract it for TEI.
155:46:27|T|CMP|Okay. I guess since we're a little down on the RCS that might be a prudent plan. Looks like we're holding our own, if it hadn't been for that practice in formation flying.
155:46:55|C|Roo|Ken, as far as the Flight Plan now - the - the new revised version, we're 15 pounds ahead of the - of the Flight Plan. And we're fat on the - on the rescue redline.
155:47:17|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds a little bit like changing the specs.
155:47:22|C|Roo|(Laughter) Well, you got to - you got to be fast on your feet. And we're 168 (pounds) above the rescue redline.
155:47:32|T|CMP|Okay. I will continue to be miserly.
155:47:36|C|Roo|By all means, and we are minus 139 on the other Flight Plan.
155:47:47|T|CMP|Roger.
155:47:52|C|Roo|Okay. And I guess that takes care of our - of our rendezvous procedures. And sounds like you got them all copied in good order and I feel certain that'll go real easy for you. That's a - that's a smooth procedure even though it takes a lot of talking. And I guess I might remind you about your Waste Storage Vent valve at this time - if you haven't already got it.
155:48:20|T|CMP|I've already turned it Off, Stuart.
155:48:22|C|Roo|Okay. I thought maybe if I talked to you long enough you might - you might miss that; but I didn't catch you.
155:48:34|T|CMP|Okay. Well, I think I'm gonna configure myself to sleep.
155:48:39|C|Roo|Okay. That's - that's all we have and we'll - Well, I guess we got maybe a couple of things there on the onboard read-outs and after that it'll be - we're through.

164:08:38|T|CMP|Okay. I got that.
164:08:40|C|Pet|Okay. And at 165:02 [164:51], change that Mapping Camera pad to a Pan Camera photo pad, and the numbers to go in there are T-start, 165:07:13 [164:50]; T-stop, 165:39:13 [165:29].
164:09:10|T|CMP|Okay. I deleted all the stuff from 165 down to the record frame; the Mapping Camera; pick up the Pan Camera; T-start, 165:07:13, and stop, 165:39:13.
164:09:26|C|Pet|That's affirmative, and 165:00 [164:49] in the Flight Plan, we want to add Gamma-Ray, Retract, 4 feet. The time is 2 minutes 43 seconds.
164:09:47|T|CMP|Okay: At 165, you want to Retract the Gamma-Ray to 2 minutes and 43 seconds worth.
164:09:54|C|Pet|That's affirmative. At 165:03 [164:52] add Pan Camera at Standby, Stereo, Power, and Operate parentheses T-start.

164:12:25|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 165 hours 2 minutes [164:50]. We've completed our shift handover in Mission Control. Flight Director Pete Frank, and the EVA team are now on. Spacecraft Communicator for the Lunar Module Orion is astronaut Tony England, and astronaut Hank Hartsfield is handling the communicator chores for the Command Module Casper. Flight Director for the Command Module is Don Puddy. At the present time Young and Duke aboard Orion, are preparing for their third period of extravehicular activity. The Flight Activities Officer estimates that they're pretty much on the planned time line for that. We expect that they'll be getting out of the Lunar Module a little after 166 hours, perhaps 166:10 to 25 [165:59 to 166:16], or between 9:45 and 10:00 am Central Standard Time. We'll continue to keep an eye on their progress and report and update that expected egress time, as necessary. During today's 5-hour extravehicular activity, primary activities will be concentrated on sampling the North Ray Crater region, and the vicinity of the Lunar Module. Departing the Lunar Module, the traverse [will] proceed to North Ray Crater. Along the normal traverses path, there will be a single station in the vicinity of the old Station 11 and 12 area at North Ray crater, and we expect to have the crew to spend about 1 hour, 5 minutes sampling at this station. Then returning from North Ray crater, along the outbound path, they'll make a 20-minute stop in the vicinity of the old station 13, which is about 1 kilometer from the rim of North Ray crater. And here they'll do some documented sampling as well as taking a rake soil sample of North Ray ejecta. They'll then return to the area of the Lunar Module. We expect that they'll spend about 34 minutes in this area, and we'll concentrate on additional sampling. In addition, John Young will obtain an additional Lunar Portable Magnetometer reading, both with and without a rock. In the case with the rock, they'll be sitting a rock on the instrument and attempting to measure the soft component of magnetism in the lunar sampling in effort to determine if the so called soft magnetism that we've seen on return samples is actually indigenous to the sample when it's picked up on the Moon, or if it perhaps something that's introduced to the sample by the electronic equipment, rotating motors and so on in the Lunar Module, or by some other magnetic field that it encounters on Earth. For the 55, final 55 minutes of the 5-hour EVA, Young and Duke will be going through closeout. Getting samples bagged up, and boxed up and back aboard the Lunar Module, getting everything buttoned up and ready for lift-off, before the time that they climb through the hatch and seal up Orion for the final time prior to LM lift-off. Ken Mattingly aboard Casper was awakened on the last revolution. He is now behind the Moon out of radio contact. We'll be reacquiring Casper in about 11 minutes, 50 seconds. Spacecraft now on its 47th revolution of the Moon. Mattingly is again in good spirits. He has a busy day ahead of him. Now, one of his major activities will be preparing for the rendezvous and subsequent docking later today. In conjunction with this, we read him up the preliminary procedures to the lunar orbit plane change manoeuvre. This puts the Command Module in the proper plane for the rendezvous and docking with the Lunar Module. That maneuver to be performed approximately [at] 169 hours, 10 minutes [168:59], but we'll refine that time. Our flight plan for that event is still not precise. We've got in block times, but not precise times, but on the scale it will appear to be about 169 hours, 15 [minutes] [169:04], and we'll as I say, getting a more precise time on that.     <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 165 hours 2 minutes [164:50].

165:09:35|T|CMP|Good morning, Henry.
165:09:36|C|Har|Good morning.
165:09:52|T|CMP|Don couldn't take any more of that, huh?
165:09:53|C|Har|They hit you pretty quick this morning, huh?
165:09:58|T|CMP|(Laughter). Yeah. That's a good way to start. Don starts off with a nice little innocuous remark like we have some Flight Plan changes for you. By the way, they start in 2 minutes (laughter).
165:10:14|C|Har|Roger. Well, how quick can you move? I got another fistful.
165:10:21|T|CMP|(Laughter). I figured you might. Go ahead.
165:10:28|C|Har|Actually, I'm sorry to hit you with all these, Ken. I know it's a mess, but the PIs are trying to recover as much SIM bay science as they can, considering the changes in the overall Flight Plan.
165:10:43|T|CMP|I understand that. Go ahead.
165:10:48|C|Har|Okay. You've already beeped the Image Motion. Is that correct?
165:10:57|T|CMP|Ah, no, sir. I got that down here at 165:27 [165:16].
165:11:04|C|Har|Okay. I didn't know whether you'd gotten that change or not. Okay. We'll go by that. We want to delete the orbital science for this rev, so you can delete that little line there at about 165:18 [165:09] where it says prepare. And at 165:30 [165:19] at the top of the next page, delete Pan Camera, Standby, and Power, On. And down at 165:35, delete the Pan Camera Power, Off, MSFN cue. Okay. Let me update your times, here. At 165:31, where it says Mass Spec, Retract, to 20 feet, the new retraction time is 33 seconds. And at 165:35, retract to 15 feet. The new retraction time is 30 seconds.
165:12:16|T|CMP|And that 30 seconds is - is starting from where I stopped at 165:30. Okay?
165:12:25|C|Har|That's affirmative. And delete the Colombo Highlands and obs- visual observations there. And in its place, add "Pan Camera, Standby, T-stop; Gamma Ray, Deploy; Pan Camera, Off, MSFN cue. And, Ken, we're gonna move these next two Mass Spec retractions up a little bit and start your eat period earlier so we can cut it off earlier. But we'll do those real time. There's no need of scribbling up the Flight Plan. I'll just give you a call when to do it. And at -
165:13:24|T|CMP|I think that's a good plan.
165:13:25|C|Har|- 165:50 [165:39] there, delete that Image Motion, Increase, barber pole/On.
165:13:33|T|CMP|Okay.
165:13:34|C|Har|And at 165:50 [165:39], we'll start your eat period. And at 166 [165:49], down at the bottom of the page, delete Mass Spec, Deploy.
165:13:50|T|CMP|Okay.
165:13:51|C|Har|And in the interest of keeping your SIM status correct, at the top up there at 165:30 [165:19] the status should be plus 1211 and all twos.
165:14:08|T|CMP|Okay.
165:14:12|C|Har|And on the next page, at 166 hours [165:49], SIM status in the first row is plus 1121, and the same holds for 166:30 [166:19].
165:14:54|C|Har|And, Casper, could you give us barber pole plus 4?

165:15:28|C|Har|Okay. Going back to the Flight Plan, at 166:45 -
165:15:43|T|CMP|Okay.
165:15:46|C|Har|You can make that end eat period. And immediately following, prepare for solar corona sunrise photos. And the T-start for those photos is 166:52:45.
165:16:12|T|CMP|Okay. T-start for the solar corona is 166:52:45.
165:16:20|C|Har|That's correct, Ken. And on the next page, 167:01, add "Laser Altimeter, Off; then P20, option 5, for 40 degrees south oblique; Noun 78: plus 270.00, plus 087.75, plus 180.00." And the Noun 79 is 0.50; set High Gain, Pitch 10, Yaw 350 for AOS acq.
165:17:25|T|CMP|Okay. At 167, it's Laser, Off; P20, Option 5, 40 degrees south oblique; Noun 78, plus 270, plus 87.75, and plus 180; Noun 79's a half degree, and it's Pitch 10, Yaw 350 for the High Gain.
165:17:42|C|Har|Roger. And at 167:05 [166:54], starting with Mapping Camera, Off, delete everything through Enable All Jets down to about 167:14 [167:03].
165:18:05|T|CMP|Okay. It's including Mapping Camera, Off, down through including Enable All Jets. That whole block is deleted.
165:18:14|C|Har|That is affirmative. And in the next line, change the Yaw for the High Gain to the 350.
165:18:28|T|CMP|Okay.
165:18:30|C|Har|At 167:22, delete the Verb 48.
165:18:36|T|CMP|Let me see. Am I supposed to be retracting that - Hey, Hank, am I supposed to be retracting that boom now?
165:18:46|C|Har|Roger. You're about 30 seconds from it. Why don't you go ahead and do that, Ken?
165:18:54|T|CMP|Okay. Well, let's do that thing and get it - get something done on it, because I'm gonna have to watch it.
165:19:05|C|Har|That's a 33-second retract time.
165:19:10|T|CMP|Okay. It's in work, and I'm watching it.
165:19:38|T|CMP|Okay. It's Off.
165:19:41|C|Har|Okay. Could you give us Auto on the High Gain?
165:19:55|T|CMP|You have it.
165:20:03|C|Har|Okay. And, Ken, getting back to that Flight Plan, there's only one more change that - at 167:30 [167:19] -
165:20:10|T|CMP|All right - go ahead.
165:20:11|C|Har|We're deleting the update block.
165:20:23|T|CMP|Okay.
165:20:24|C|Har|And that ought to get us through another rev. Do you have your Noun 93s from your P52?
165:20:35|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Let me look back here and find them. Okay. They were minus 0.103, minus 001, plus 0.097. And I torqued those at 164:47:20.
165:20:57|C|Har|Roger; copy.
165:21:12|C|Har|And, Ken, I have a TEI-55 block data.
165:21:21|T|CMP|Okay. Just a minute. Let me get my other book. Keep an eye on the clock there. I got another retraction and a Pan Camera to worry about there.
165:21:35|C|Har|Roger.

165:23:43|C|Har|Okay. And this is a 30-second.
165:23:49|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
165:23:56|T|CMP|Now, it's coming in.
165:24:25|T|CMP|And it's Off. Readback: TEI-55, SPS/G&N; 38144; plus 0.67, plus 1.05; 182:37:26.53; plus 2864.2, plus 0396.6, minus 0096.9; 181, 095, 010; Sirius and Rigel; 131, 029, 016; two jets, 17 seconds; lambda, minus 159.03. This pad's based on Flight Change Number 1 and the ascent REFSMMAT.
165:25:04|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
165:25:16|C|Har|And real quickly here on the SIM status, Mapping Camera's perking along real good; 98-frame margin. The Laser Altimeter now is getting about 65 percent, good altitude. We've had 1431 firings. Pan Camera is overexposing by one and a half f-stops, because of a bias in the exposure-command voltage. We're 47 frames ahead on that. The rest of the SIM bay apparatus is working real - nominal.
165:25:52|T|CMP|Okay. Has the X-Ray experiment detected anything that looks unusual about the Descartes area, or anything like that?
165:26:03|C|Har|Okay. I'll see if I can get a reading on that.
165:26:03|P|PAO|One additional change in our Flight Plan schedules which affects television. During the rendezvous and docking, we had originally planned to have television coverage of this. Because of the Lunar Module High Gain Antenna, the LMP's steerable antenna is not functioning, the Lunar Module operates on the Omni directional antennas. We experienced the problem prior to the LM landing where the relatively weak signal strength of the Lunar Module coupled with the comparatively much stronger signal strength from the Command Module High Gain Antenna was saturating the receivers on the ground stations and we were blocking LM communications. In order to avoid this sort of problem, we will not use the High Gain Antenna on the Command Module so that we get a more balanced signal strength level from the two vehicles and don't run into this saturation problem. Because we won't be using the Command Module High Gain Antenna, we also will not be able to receive television during the rendezvous and docking activities.</p>     <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> One additional change in our Flight Plan schedules which affects television.

165:29:19|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds reasonable. Going all the way out and back in for 93.
165:29:24|C|Har|That's affirmative. And that would get us back to the 10-foot point that I was just - just getting ready to call you for.
165:31:00|T|CMP|Okay. I'm gonna bring the Mass Spec boom in now.
165:31:03|C|Har|Okay, Ken. 93 seconds.

165:33:20|C|Har|Have you had time to work up a crew status report yet, Ken?
165:33:27|T|CMP|(Laughter). In between the other things? It's a short one. It shouldn't take me a second.
165:33:37|C|Har|All right. Take your time; I was just trying to get all this dirty work out of the way so you'd have an uninterrupted eat period.
165:33:51|T|CMP|(Laughter). Uninterrupted only by [the] solar corona [observations]. Okay. About PRD, 15054; 7 hours; and none. And yesterday - let's see - well, shoot! They don't even have Meal A in this book. I don't know why it's split this way, but - You can delete the - Well, the only thing I had out of Meal B that's on the list there is the graham crackers and the cocoa. I also had bacon squares, coffee, and some of that pineapple fruit cake, and an apricot bar, and orange juice, and another package of graham crackers spread out throughout the - the day. Meal C: You can delete the beef steak, and the chicken and rice, and the pecans. And you can add that lobster from Meal B.

165:37:55|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Could you give us Retract on the Mass Spec boom, 20 seconds? That's a change, 20 seconds.
165:38:05|T|CMP|Okay; this is 20 seconds.
165:38:18|T|CMP|Coming in now.
165:38:35|T|CMP|It's Off.
165:38:37|C|Har|Roger.
165:40:25|T|CMP|Hank, where is that extra crater that you said you had down. there?
165:40:33|C|Har|What was that, Ken?
165:40:37|C|Har|You said something about an extra crater down there. Aw, I've lost it now.
165:40:44|C|Har|Oh. That was between Double Spot over where the LM was and down to the south there towards Stone Mountain. As they were coming back from the surface, it was very apparent there was a very large depression, a subdued crater. There was a - some - they estimated 300 meters, maybe even larger in diameter.
165:41:06|T|CMP|Okay. I guess I looked in the wrong place. I looked short of the landing area.
165:50:55|T|CMP|Henry, do you remember the little helmet-shaped -
165:50:57|C|Har|Yeah.
165:50:58|T|CMP|- area we had just south of the Riphaeus Mountains?
165:51:01|C|Har|Yes, sir.
165:51:02|T|CMP|They showed up in the color differentials. Well, it does have a different color to it. It's - in this sunlight, it seems like these - the things that were showing up on - those red-and-blue color differences - they're showing up more in the low-Suns. Because I can see the mare differences back by Lassell in low-Sun. And they don't show up so well now. And now this one shows up very dramatically as this little - little piece of ... out here. And it's kind of - it's just a little tanner than the rest of the mare.
165:52:00|C|Har|That's a little - kind of interesting to find out that the color's different there than the surroundings.
165:52:10|T|CMP|Yeah, and the texture is a little different, too. I got the binocs on it now. The mare has a large number of very small pits in it, as well as a - it's almost a random distribution of crater sizes. This little patch of ground has - oh, I guess about the same distribution of the larger craters, but the little pits don't show quite as much. It's a - it has a ropy texture across the top, not - not as ropy as a - as a pahoehoe flow or anything like that, but just kind of has a little pattern to it. It has some lineaments that run kind of - I guess that's sort of northwest. And it looks like it may be associated with these other little clumps of material that stick out around it here. And - I was trying to compare that to the Riphaeus Mountains, and it looks like - the material looks the same. And another thing I'd never noticed before that looking at the Riphaeus Mountains here - I'm looking at the - at the step of the - let's see, this eastern edge. And if you're - remember that back around Flamstead there's a little foot, a little toe or ring that goes around the inside. And the Riphaeus Mountains all have that little toe. Now whether that's a high-water mark or a second unit, it's hard to say. But all along the margin that I can see - there's that little toe. And it seems to be at the same elevation. And that's true for some of the little patches a little further back - back inland. It looks like a break in slope and a changing color both.
165:54:45|C|Har|What else do you see in there?
165:54:50|T|CMP|I see that it's getting dark outside, and it's time for an eat period inside.
165:54:55|C|Har|(Laughter). Roger.
165:54:59|T|CMP|No, it's an interesting place, you just need to have more time to look at it.
165:55:17|T|CMP|And I'm all set up for the solar corona. The cameras are all set. The checklist is complete down to turning the tape on.
165:55:28|C|Har|Roger. Why don't you take time to eat then, and - I'll just check out with you at AO - at LOS.
165:55:37|T|CMP|All right, sir. Thank you.
165:55:48|T|CMP|Maybe everyone else in the world knew about that little toe in the Riphaeus Mountains. I just never had heard anyone mention that before.
165:55:58|C|Har|Roger. That sounds interesting.
165:56:08|C|Har|Farouk and the boys in the backroom have been eagerly absorbing your remarks the last couple of days.
165:56:18|T|CMP|Yeah, but all the questions they ask, I can't answer.
165:57:12|T|CMP|You know, Hank, one of the things I was thinking about last night that might help remember a lot of the things we've seen - do you suppose there's a - any DAC film that I can use to, say, set to look out the window? And I'll see if I can maybe just tape the DAC up somewhere and let it take a one-frame-per-second strip, or something that would give us some reasonable overlap - around the lighted part of the Moon.
165:57:47|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We'll take a look at that.
165:57:54|T|CMP|I think I could probably tape the camera somewhere so it would have a - a view approximately the same as what we've been seeing.
166:03:53|C|Har|Casper, no need to acknowledge. Your consumables look good, and, on the RCS, we're making a little money. We're about 188 pounds now above the rescue red line.
166:04:07|T|CMP|Okay. That sounds good.
166:05:43|T|CMP|Henry, are the surface guys out cranking up their little car yet?
166:05:51|C|Har|Yes, sir. They got out about 30 minutes early, and they are moving on out.
166:08:40|C|Har|Casper, Houston. John and Charlie are powering up the LRV now, and FAO says you're cleared to use magazine EE and KK. At the present, they are on schedule.
166:08:59|T|CMP|EE and KK. Okay, what kind are they? Are they CEX?
166:09:04|C|Har|Both of those are CEX.
166:09:10|T|CMP|Okay. And I'll just use the settings off the photo wheel the same as we use for the 250.
166:09:18|C|Har|That ought to work out okay, Ken.
166:09:23|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
166:11:43|C|Har|Casper, we have been noting a little oscillation in the high gain at acquisition, and we were wondering if you're still noticing that discrepancy between the angles and the knobs when you're in the manual mode. It appears to us that it may be off a little bit in yaw.
166:12:07|T|CMP|Okay, I'll - I'll set them on the - I've been setting them on the dials rather than on the knobs.
166:12:20|C|Har|Right. That's preferable - to use the meter there.
166:12:28|T|CMP|Okay.
166:12:30|C|Har|Is that dial for setting the yaw - is it loose?
166:12:38|T|CMP|No. No. Huh-uh. It just has that bias. It had it during - I guess it was the last time we were out there in the bird before flight for some test, I noticed that it had a difference in reading. I can't remember now what the occasion was, but I know that - that - that the biggest error is in the pitch channel rather than in the yaw channel.
166:13:14|C|Har|Okay, we copy.
166:13:20|T|CMP|Do you have a procedure you'd rather have me try at acquisition to help out?
166:13:37|C|Har|Okay, if you see the signal strength oscillating a little bit, I guess the best procedure is to go to Wide and wait.
166:13:47|T|CMP|Okay.
166:15:45|C|Har|Casper, we are about 3 minutes from LOS. Everything is looking good. The laser has degraded a little more, but other than that, everything is okay.
166:16:00|T|CMP|Okay. I'll see you on the other side.
166:16:04|C|Har|All righty.
167:06:59|T|CMP|Hello, Houston. Are you there?
167:07:02|C|Har|Hello, Casper. How is it going?
167:07:07|T|CMP|Oh, pretty good. Got our solar corona done, and we got a little 16-millimeter strip ... - Unfortunately, I missed the first couple of minutes while I was changing mags, but you're pretty close to a full rev. This has turned out to be a - I was looking through the Flight Plan to see a good rev, and it looked like this one has the hatch window pointing almost straight down; it's probably the best rev we got going.
167:07:40|C|Har|Okay. Did you see anything worth talking about up there before AOS?
167:07:51|T|CMP|No, sir. I spent all my time getting the camera set up.
167:07:58|C|Har|Roger. John and Charlie are at North Ray now, and, boy, is that a big hole.
167:08:05|T|CMP|Did they have any trouble getting up there? I guess not.
167:08:08|C|Har|Negative. They whizzed right on up there. Unfortunately, they are not in a position they can see the bottom, and it looks like they might have to fall in it first.
167:08:21|T|CMP|Well, let's not get that picture.
167:08:24|C|Har|Roger. And also a surprise. They didn't see any evidence of bedding in the crater anywhere they looked.
167:08:34|T|CMP|I don't see any from here, either, it looks like a little slumping, but that's all.
167:08:40|C|Har|I guess those little things we saw in the photos just fooled us. It turns out that that little black spot on the east rim that was in the photo was really there. It turns out it's one huge dark-colored rock.
167:08:57|T|CMP|Is that right? Wonderful. They're going to chip it and get a piece out of the center, huh?
167:09:04|C|Har|Well, we wanted them to turn it over, but they decided against it.
167:09:22|T|CMP|Did they make any comment on what the material looked like on their drive up to North Ray?
167:09:29|C|Har|Most of it appeared to be breccia; however, they did pass one that was a frothy looking thing that - we probably saw our first basalt.
167:09:53|T|CMP|Well, it still looks like to me that path that they drove up on is part of all that furrowed Descartes unit.
167:10:38|T|CMP|Hank, would you give me a call at time 39 please?
167:10:45|C|Har|Okay. Will do. And could you give us Auto -
167:10:49|T|CMP|Thank you -
167:10:50|C|Har|- for the High Gain?
167:10:52|T|CMP|- stopped again. You've got it.
167:11:16|C|Har|And, Ken, if you like, I can go ahead and read up your plane change pad.
167:11:25|T|CMP|Okay, let me - let me do a couple more cleanup chores and I'll be ready to copy.
167:11:29|C|Har|Okay, and they are just putting on the finishing touches on the Flight Plan change.
167:11:38|T|CMP|Okay.
167:13:12|C|Har|Casper, if you will give us Accept, we'll send up your state vector and target load.
167:13:27|T|CMP|Okay, you have it.
167:14:06|T|CMP|My water spout looks like a Christmas tree ornament. It's actually very pretty. It's got a nice big bubble of water about an inch and a half in diameter sitting there on it, just looking at me. And it's just as round - it looks like the cartoons of the - the Jello that all the little mice play in.
167:14:36|C|Har|Roger.
167:16:17|T|CMP|And, Hank, I took a couple of pictures on frame ZZ; that's frame numbers 22 and 23, of that water bubble, so the folks can see what we're talking about when we say that - that gas separator has a big bubble on the end of it.
167:16:38|C|Har|Roger.
167:18:22|T|CMP|Casper, the computer is yours.
167:18:29|T|CMP|Okay, be with you - Okay, that's in Block. And do you remember the guys - I think the folks from Marshall - saying that they thought if you had bubble of water and you hit it with another bubble in zero g that one bubble ought to go through the other one?
167:18:58|C|Har|Roger.
167:19:03|T|CMP|It seems like they said something like that. I don't remember all the details, but I thought there was a good chance. I had one bubble, I'd try a second one. And I put the water gun on it. And from where I was standing, I really couldn't see all the dynamics; but it looks to me like it splashed out the back side, and the bubble was still intact on the front. Now whether it went through or had a reflection and bounced off the - the other side, I can't really tell. It did develop some air bubbles inside of the big bubble. So there may be some interesting dynamics there.
167:19:39|C|Har|Hey, that sounds real interesting.
167:19:50|T|CMP|Okay. I got my toys put up now and I guess next thing in order is to copy a little plane change pad, huh?
167:20:00|C|Har|Roger. Are you ready to copy?
167:20:12|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
167:20:18|C|Har|Okay. LOPC-1, SPS/G&N; 38585; plus 0.45, plus 1.02; 169:17:39.49; minus 0001.5, minus 0124.7, all zips; attitude is all zips; 0 pitch - roll, pitch and yaw; Noun 44, 0064.5, plus 0055.3; 0124.7, 0:07, 0113.0; the rest is NA; Sirius and Rigel; 197, 240, 301; two jets, 16 seconds; quads Bravo and Delta; other, HIGH GAIN angles for AOS and burn altitude, Pitch; plus 13; Yaw, plus 258.
167:22:04|T|CMP|Okay. I copy LOPC-1, SPS/G&N; 38585; plus 0.45, plus 1.02; 169:17:39.49; minus 0001.5, minus 0124.7, all zips; attitude is all zips; 0064.5 plus 0055.3; 0124.7, 0:07, 0113.0; Sirius and Rigel; 197, 240, 301; two jets for 16 seconds on quads Bravo and Delta; High Gain angles at AOS, Pitch plus 13, Yaw plus 258.
167:22:44|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
167:26:18|T|CMP|Hank, we didn't say anything about this Verb 48 at 167:20, but I assume we meant to delete that.
167:26:29|C|Har|I called that up to you, Ken. I thought you got that. You acknowledged it.
167:26:39|T|CMP|Okay. Well, that's another on my score, then.
167:28:37|C|Har|Casper, we done passed your 39. It's 40 now.
167:28:44|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
167:28:45|C|Har|Sorry about that.
167:28:52|T|CMP|Ha, that evens the score.
167:28:56|C|Har|Roger.
167:29:10|T|CMP|That's not fair. I was really going to - I really did forget, because I was going to engage you in some verbal discourse to distract you so that you would let me forget it and I could redeem myself.
167:29:25|C|Har|Roger. I had - I had a diversion down here. We're fighting the Flight Plan.
167:30:33|C|Har|And, Ken, we'd like to get your Flight Plan update up to you, and would you prefer to do it after your visuals or start on it now?
167:30:45|T|CMP|Oh, let's see. How much time have I got? Probably I'd just as soon start now.
167:30:52|C|Har|Okay, why don't we get going with it then? Okay, the first - the first change comes at 168:05.
167:31:13|T|CMP|Okay.
167:31:14|C|Har|At 168:05, Mapping Camera, Off, T-stop; Verb 49 maneuver to P52 attitude; that attitude is 142, 250, 042. Mapping Camera , Standby - that should be 30 seconds, about the time you do that maneuver; Image Motion, Off.
167:31:59|T|CMP|Roger.
167:32:05|C|Har|Laser Altimeter, Off - and that's a verify; Mapping Camera, Retract; X-Ray, Standby; Mass Spec Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiments, Standby. And there is a caution: wait 5 minutes before Retract; Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Closed; Alpha Particle X-Ray Cover, Closed; Gamma Ray, Retract; Mass Spec, Retract: enable all jets.
167:33:37|T|CMP|Okay, just a second and I'll read it back to you.
167:34:03|T|CMP|How about if I read that back to you after I pass the landing site?
167:34:20|C|Har|Okay.
167:34:24|T|CMP|Is that going to crowd us for time? You've got a better feel for it than I have.
167:34:30|C|Har|I don't think so, Ken, if we can get right on it right after the visual.
167:34:37|T|CMP|Okay.
167:36:55|C|Har|Ken, John and Charlie are still at North Ray and they have found some basalt clast.
167:37:08|T|CMP|Very good. Around the outside or up on the rim?
167:37:14|C|Har|Roger. They are still on the rim.
167:37:41|T|CMP|The thing that I find most puzzling about North Ray is that the albedo comes up - and I can see - as the sun comes up the albedo change shows some, but I can see the rays around there a lot better now. And the rays lay on top of that material that seems to run, that they drove up on. Well, I take it back, it looks like there's a little tongue of that material that's probably about where they drove. It doesn't appear to be as white as the stuff just a little bit further to the east. But all that material down to the east and all the stuff that goes over - goes over to Ravine all look like the same stuff and looks very similar in character to Smoky. I see no evidence of rays in North Ray except for some blocks on the sides there, probably just slump blocks in slump patterns. And taking a quick comparison with South Ray, the - I'm not so sure South Ray is much different. Okay; I'm ready to go back to copying updates.
167:39:18|C|Har|Ah - Roger, do you want to read back what we had there for 168:05?
167:39:25|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see - 168:05. Okay. I wanted to question - I had a T-stop time for the camera of 05:41, and you just gave me 05. Do you want me to stop it at that, or do you want me to go on to -
167:39:43|C|Har|05:41 is the correct stop time. We just - this is just putting in words what goes along about that time.
167:39:55|T|CMP|Okay. And then Verb 49 to a P52 attitude, which is 152, 250, 042.
167:40:02|C|Har|Correction on that. That's 142.
167:40:04|T|CMP|Mapping Camera to Standby. What did I read to you, 142, 250, 042?
167:40:15|C|Har|That's correct.
167:40:19|T|CMP|Okay. Then it's Mapping Camera to Standby. That's at 30 seconds after we get Off. Then IMC, Off; Laser Altimeter, verify Off; Mapping Camera, Retract; X-Ray to Standby; Mass Spec Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiment to Standby; wait 5 minutes before retraction; then I can go ahead and close the Mapping Camera Laser Altimeter Cover; the Alpha X-Ray Door can be Closed; the Gamma Ray can be Retracted and after the 5 minutes I can retract the Mass Spec. Then I will enable a couple of thrusters.
167:40:58|C|Har|Good readback. At 168:15 H<sub>2</sub> Purge Line Heaters, On; P52-
167:41:15|T|CMP|Okay 168 - wait a minute, say that again, Henry.
167:41:22|C|Har|Roger, the H<sub>2</sub> Purge Line Heaters, On at 168:15, and following that a P52 Option 3, and then an Option 1. You are going from the landing site to the burn orient.
167:41:45|T|CMP|Okay, that will be an Option 1 and then an Option 3.
167:41:51|C|Har|That will be Option 3 then Option 1.
167:42:02|T|CMP|Okay.
167:42:04|C|Har|And just a reminder to use SCS for that, I guess you got that down as a standard procedure now.
167:42:14|T|CMP|Okay. That's a good reminder nevertheless.
167:42:20|C|Har|Well, what we are going to do here, Ken, is we're going - you're going to have to get a scratch pad now - we're - there's just no place in the Flight Plan we can do this conveniently. And we'll just give you times and things to do, and fill in the gap between 168:30 and 172:30. And if you want to do that, get your pad out. I'll read these things to you.
167:42:55|T|CMP|Okay. I got a pad. Do you think we know enough to - right now that it'll pretty much sequential or do we need to leave spaces for alterations? You know, we got some of those real-time checklist sheets in the Updates book, let's see if that is appropriate.
167:43:14|C|Har|I think that's probably a good thing to use. And Ken, I think we got a pretty good handle, too, on what should happen in sequence, so you wouldn't want to leave too many spaces.
167:43:37|T|CMP|Okay. Well, we got lots of these Flight Plan update sheets, so why don't I use them? And I'm ready. Let me mark this so I can always find this page. Just a second before you read it to me.
167:44:21|C|Har|And, Ken, we don't plan to update your platform before the burn, just the affirmation.
167:44:30|T|CMP|All right. Okay. I've got my paper in hand. Ready to copy.
167:44:56|C|Har|Okay. Time 168:30, configure for urine dump; 168:37, P30; Verb 49 maneuver to LOPC-1 attitude.
167:45:19|T|CMP|Okay.
167:45:22|C|Har|168:40 H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge, waste water dump, and urine dump.
167:45:44|T|CMP|Okay. And you want me to dump them both at the same time, right?
167:45:49|C|Har|That's affirmative. And 168: -
167:45:54|T|CMP|Okay.
167:45:55|C|Har|- 50 terminate waste water dump at 10 percent and H<sub>2</sub> Purge Line Heaters, Off.
167:46:20|T|CMP|Okay.
167:46:22|C|Har|Okay. They couldn't work that Mass Spec dump in there, Ken. They tried, but they couldn't. 168:55, pre-SPS SIM prep; set DET counting up to LOPC-1; secure equipment for LOPC-1
167:47:13|T|CMP|Okay.
167:47:15|C|Har|At 169:05, P40; at 169:13, AOS and that will be those angles you have, pitch, plus 13; yaw, 258; at approximately 169:17 is LOPC-1. And we hope we'll have a good lockup, but it's only about 4 minutes, there, and we hope we'll be locked up so we can watch. At 169:20 -
167:48:04|T|CMP|Okay.
167:48:07|C|Har|- P00. Okay. And, also, I guess I should tell you, you can use the burn table for that LOPC burn. It's on page 223 of the Flight Plan. That's got all your burn rules and so on.
167:48:29|T|CMP|All right. Let me check that real fast.
167:49:04|T|CMP|Okay. Those look like familiar rules.
167:49:12|C|Har|Okay. And at 169:25 we'll up-link you a liftoff REFSMMAT, and at 169:30, your post-SPS-burn SIM prep, and that still leaves a gap there of about 3 hours, and that's your - after LOPC-1 we don't want to clutter up until we get through with that. But we'll go ahead and give you the rest of the things that fill in here.
167:49:44|T|CMP|Okay. I'll still need the - plenty of time to get the cockpit squared away for rendezvous.
167:49:51|C|Har|We plan to give you lots of time for that, Ken. Do you want to read back what you got there, just to make sure we agree?
167:49:59|T|CMP|Yes sir. Let's see. Have we got anything coming up here that we are supposed to be watching before I read it back?
167:50:05|C|Har|I'm watching your Mapping Camera.
167:50:33|T|CMP|Okay. I'll read back. 168:30, configure for urine dump; 37 to P30, Verb 49, the Lunar Orbit Plane Change Number 1 attitude; at time 40, hydrogen and oxygen fuel cell purge; we turn Line Heater On back here at 168:15. Okay, at 40 we also do waste water and urine dump; at 50 terminate waste water dump at 10 percent, and turn the Purge Line Heaters Off; 55, pre-SPS SIM prep; set the DET counting up and secure equipment; at 169:05 it's P40; at 13 it's AOS, with a Pitch 13, YAW 256.
167:51:22|C|Har|That's 258.
167:51:27|T|CMP|At 17, it's plane change 1, 258. Okay. I got that on the other PAD, too. All right, at 17 it's plane change 1, I use the burn rules off of page 223; at 20 I'll go to P00; at 25 you give me an up-link of the ascent REFSMMAT; at 30 I'll do the post-SPS SIM prep.
167:51:45|C|Har|Roger. And I guess there you will use your modified burn card with a 509 et cetera.
167:51:54|T|CMP|Okay. And I'll start the 509 right after my P52.
167:52:04|C|Har|0kay.
167:52:15|T|CMP|Then do an SCS; then I'll call 509; and then I'll take 509 down and I'll use the modified card where I start at gimbals - bring the bus ties on at 8 minutes.
167:53:18|C|Har|That's a good plan, Ken, and the - where we are going to pick up the Flight Plan again is at 168:30, to start preparing for rendezvous, and from 168:30 on to 175 hours, if you add 4 hours to all of those times, they're close enough that we can use them all the way through the rendezvous.
167:53:46|T|CMP|All right. That's a help.
167:53:54|C|Har|In other words, 168:30 becomes 172:30 and so on down the line all the way through, and even the lift-off time is within a minute or so. You always get an update on that anyhow, so this section of the Flight Plan will be good.
167:54:11|T|CMP|Okay. Swing. All right sir. I guess I got my work cut out.
167:54:30|C|Har|And, Casper, you are about 15 seconds from T-stop on the Mapping Camera.
167:54:48|T|CMP|All right. Thank you. And it's Off.
167:55:53|T|CMP|Okay. Our - manoeuvre is underway, Mapping Camera is coming to Standby, the IMC is Off, it's barber pole at gray, the Laser is verified Off, Mapping Camera is coming to Retract.
167:56:36|T|CMP|Mark.
167:56:51|T|CMP|The X-Ray is at Standby, the Mass Spec Ion Source is Off. Mass Spec Experiment is in Standby.
168:00:19|C|Har|Casper, we're showing a Retract on the Mapping Camera. Does that agree with you?
168:00:25|T|CMP|I'll check; just a second. Yes sir. That's about 3 minutes and 30 seconds or so.
168:00:39|C|Har|Roger.
168:01:05|T|CMP|Okay. Here comes the Alpha and X-Ray Door. They're closed, and Altimeter's Off, the Camera's in, so here comes the Camera and Laser Door. That must have been in; the door closed. Okay. The Gamma is coming to Retract, and I show it's been 6 minutes, so I'm gonna bring the Mass Spec to Retract, too.
168:01:53|C|Har|We concur.
168:01:58|T|CMP|Okay. Then we'll start on my P52. Got the Purge Line Heaters- On a minute early so I won't forget those. Okay, I'm in SCS control and I'm gonna call P52.
168:02:28|C|Har|Roger.
168:04:59|T|CMP|I must have one of the planets right up there above, right in that area, too. Does that sound right? That's around Nunki.
168:05:11|C|Har|Well, we'll take a look.
168:05:51|T|CMP|(Laughter). Okay. Back and do an Option 1 now.
168:05:59|C|Har|Roger.
168:05:59|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control [at 168:09]. The [LM] crew again [are] pointing the High Gain Antenna and we expect to get approximately 20 minutes at this location, perhaps a little bit less, we're running just a little bit behind on the timeline. While we're waiting for the communications and the television to come back in we might also mention that Ken Mattingly, aboard the orbiting CSM Casper, is preparing to do a plane change manoeuvre to put the spacecraft in the proper position for rendezvous and docking later with the Lunar Module. That manoeuvre is to be performed at 169 hours 17 minutes 39 seconds. It'll be on the next revolution and on the 49 revolution of the Moon. The manoever will be performed with the Service Propulsion System engine changing the velocity 124.7 feet per second, and it will be a 7 second burn [of] that Service Propulsion System Engine. Sounds as if the crew is starting to get the antenna aligned.</p>     <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at 168:09].

168:10:05|T|CMP|Okay. I have these numbers if anybody wants them.
168:10:16|C|Har|We got them.
168:12:07|T|CMP|Okay. I don't think those are worth torquing, are they?
168:12:10|C|Har|Negative.
168:12:18|T|CMP|Yes, you have Jupiter in my field of view, and all his little moons.
168:12:26|C|Har|Roger.
168:12:28|T|CMP|He sure must be a longs ways off, because even now he's not very big. You can see his moons, though. That's about all you can tell from it - tell who he is.
168:12:44|C|Har|Okay, Ken, before LOS here, after you exit that 52, we'd like to check your boom talkbacks.
168:12:50|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by, and I'll be with you. Okay. I've got -
168:12:56|T|CMP|The CMC Mode on the Optics on Zero to resolve - All that's put to bed. I'm going to start the 509. I'll look at your talkbacks first. Oh, now I've got 2, I got 2 of these things that show barber pole. Both the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray.
168:13:23|C|Har|Okay. We show that both booms are not fully retracted; however, we do show them past the point where it's safe for an SPS burn. So we'd like for you now to take the Deploy-Retract switches on both of those to Off.
168:13:42|T|CMP|Okay. They are safe for burns. I guess we ought to try that in sunlight.
168:14:18|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We're about 3 minutes from LOS.
168:14:21|T|CMP|Okay. We - go ahead.
168:14:23|C|Har|In case we don't get comm before the burn, and at this point you're Go for the burn, the only thing you haven't done is look at your target load. You still have to enable the jets, according to the Flight Plan, and when you do your pre-SPS burn card on the SIM Bay, you'll be turning the Alpha Particle and X-Ray Off and going to Boost on the Pan Camera.
168:14:53|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
168:15:31|C|Har|And, Ken, be sure you load your DAP before you load 509.
168:15:38|T|CMP|Wilco. I was gonna try to let you take a look at the vector P40 before we got to LOS.
168:15:49|C|Har|Okay.
168:16:03|T|CMP|Okay. You've got it.
168:17:36|C|Har|You had a good vector, Casper.
168:17:42|T|CMP|Okay. And I've got the DAP loaded.
169:03:42|T|CMP|Hello, Houston. How you doing?
169:03:44|C|Har|Hello, Casper. How's it going? Are you all set up?
169:03:50|T|CMP|All set to go. 509 is out, I'm in attitude, and we must be right, I'm going sideways.
169:03:56|C|Har|Roger.
169:03:58|T|CMP|Counting down at 155. I'm on Vox, and I'll give you the final couple of steps on Vox.
169:04:12|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We got data and everything looks good. You're still go.
169:04:22|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, sir.
169:04:54|T|CMP|In one minute, the EMS is going to Normal. Translation Control Power is on. Translation Controller and Rotation Controllers are Armed.
169:05:09|C|Har|Got it.
169:05:10|T|CMP|The Arm light is out; the SPS Delta-V Thrust A is coming on -
169:05:15|T|CMP|Mark.
169:05:26|T|CMP|Average g is on. IPS [?] look good.
169:05:38|T|CMP|Ullage. Good ullage. Attitude's good. Engine enable.
169:05:54|T|CMP|There's ignition.
169:06:02|T|CMP|Auto shutdown.
169:06:18|T|CMP|Okay, residuals, I have - on Y is minus 0.1. I'll get you the Verb 6 Noun 20s, and you can watch that while I turn the Gimbal Motors, Off.
169:06:44|T|CMP|There's Number 2's Off; number 1's are Off. Normal powers are Off. Do you have the attitude, Houston?
169:06:54|C|Har|That's affirmative.
169:07:00|T|CMP|Okay; I see that is no trim.
169:07:30|T|CMP|My Delta-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 9.1.
169:07:36|C|Har|Roger; 9.1.
169:08:06|T|CMP|And I assume you're handling the DSE now so - Yeah, looks like you got it.
169:08:11|C|Har|That's affirmative, Ken.
169:08:16|T|CMP|Okay; the Bus Ties came Off normally. I noticed when I set it up that - just before putting them on that Bus B - Battery B was reading a little bit lower than the others. It was reading about 34.
169:08:30|C|Har|That's Roger, Ken. And we're - just about ready to do a Bat B charge. I'll give you a call. And if you'll give us Accept, we're ready to up-link the REFSMMAT.
169:08:43|T|CMP|You have Accept. And you want these fuel readings? I'm not sure they're valid, but it's 31.8 oxidizer, 32.8 on fuel, and a balance is now showing a minus - a decrease of 275, but we made the burn in the fixed position with secondary valves and Normal position.
169:09:11|C|Har|Roger; copy.
169:10:58|C|Har|Casper, the computer's yours, and we did your Verb 66 for you. And we'd like for you to start a Bat B charge.
169:10:58|||<p class="tech"><b>169 11 t0 Mattingly:</b> -Okay. Let me finish my SIM bay configuration, and I'll be right with it.
169:11:34|T|CMP|Okay; you'd like to have a Battery B charge.
169:17:36|T|CMP|You guys are awful quiet, Henry. You must be plotting.
169:17:45|C|Har|Roger. We got some more Flight Plan changes for you. Let me just read you the first one, here, and let you get going. We want you to do a Verb 49 maneuver to a P52 attitude. And it's about a 15-minute maneuver; we want you there by 46. So why don't you go ahead and load it up, and I'll give you the angles there: 180, 075, 345.
169:18:16|T|CMP|Okay; 180, 075, and 345. And can I put the computer in Block?
169:18:25|C|Har|The computer's yours.
169:19:22|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. What time you need me there?
169:19:26|C|Har|Roger; at 46. Looks like you gonna make it. And you might keep an eye on the middle gimbal angle on this thing. We're gonna watch it, too.
169:19:34|T|CMP|- with more than a minute. Oh, it should be clear. It's got a good bit of roll to go with that yaw. But I will keep an eye on it. Okay; why don't you read on?
169:20:01|C|Har|Okay, at 169:46, P52, Option 1. And we want to pulse torque to the Ascent orient.
169:20:17|T|CMP|Okay. And this time you want to do a pulse torque, P52, Option 1, at 46.
169:20:21|C|Har|Roger. And following that, open the Alpha Particle/X-Ray cover, and then turn the X-Ray on.
169:20:38|T|CMP|Okay. Then Open the Alpha/X-Ray cover, and the X-Ray to on.
169:20:43|C|Har|Roger. 169:51, Verb 49 maneuver to Moulton point attitude, to be there at 170:20. And that's about a 9-minute maneuver. The Moulton point attitude is 225, 233, 358.
169:21:21|T|CMP|Okay, at time 51, I go to the Moulton point attitude: 225, 233, 358; and I have to be there by 170:20.
169:21:30|C|Har|Roger. And High Gain to Auto at your convenience.
169:21:37|T|CMP|You've got it.
169:21:39|C|Har|Okay; and following that maneuver, at that same time, go to the Experiment Checklist, Gegensehein pass Number 2, Page X/2-3, Steps 1 to 4.
169:22:04|T|CMP|Okay; that's - Experiment Checklist, page X/2-3, Gegenschein pass 2. Now you gave me some step numbers; does that mean I don't do the whole pass?
169:22:19|C|Har|Well, we want the photos to start at 17:28.
169:22:29|T|CMP|Okay; stand by a minute. Let me get to that.
169:22:45|C|Har|What that's doing, Ken, is that's one of these things where you manoeuvre around to the Moulton point, to the anti-solar point, and to the - do those sequences. So Steps 1 through 4 get you through the Moulton point sequence, then you got to do a little manoeuvre to the anti-solar point.
169:23:02|T|CMP|Okay. Okay, but like I'm gonna do the whole sequence. When you read steps, I thought maybe there was something I was supposed to leave out. Okay. So all we need is another set of attitudes and some times. Now let me have this Moulton point time? It has to be done no earlier than some given time.
169:23:20|C|Har|Roger. We want you to start at 170:28. 170:28.
169:23:30|T|CMP|I will certainly try. But that's also the earliest. Is that correct?
169:23:34|C|Har|That's affirmative. Following that sequence, at approx - well, that time is all wrong there. But we want you to do a Verb 49 maneuver to the anti-solar point. That's about a 5-minute manoeuvre. And the attitude is 279, 223, 356.
169:24:18|T|CMP|Oh, boy, - Hank, if we stick a 5-minute - a maneuver as long as that in there, I'm not sure we're gonna make it. Do you know why we're changing the roll that much? Last time we didn't change roll at all. We just made a little pitch maneuver down there.
169:24:33|C|Har|Okay. FAO'll check that. But that is the same place there on the page on the checklist, the next step.
169:24:45|T|CMP|Okay.
169:24:47|C|Har|They say here, if that is correct, that they want you at that attitude by 170:36, but as far as I'm concerned, you just step through the sequence.
169:25:00|T|CMP|That's the only thing I can do, Hank.
169:25:02|C|Har|Roger.
169:25:14|T|CMP|What was that target time again? 170:36?
169:25:18|C|Har|That's affirmative.
169:25:23|T|CMP|Okay.
169:25:24|C|Har|You won't be there by then if that - Oh, I see. FAO says what they're trying to do is combine deep-space measurements with the - with these photos.
169:25:47|T|CMP|Okay.
169:25:50|C|Har|And you're not going to be at that attitude by 36. It'll be more like 38.
169:26:00|T|CMP|At the best; yes, sir. Now we can put in a higher rate; that's up to you folks. Is it worth the gas?
169:26:13|C|Har|You got the gas if you want to do it.
169:26:21|T|CMP|Well, I'd like to get as much data as I can, Hank. I don't know how to assess what's - worth keeping a little RCS for rendezvous. As opposed to -
169:26:32|C|Har|Okay; press ahead and use the gas. Go to a higher rate and let's get these things.
169:26:39|T|CMP|Okay. I'll - I'll set the - right after I get to the Moulton attitude, I'll change the DAP to the high rate.
169:27:06|C|Har|Okay, is there any question on that Gegenschein thing there, Ken?
169:27:13|T|CMP|I'm just looking it over. Just a second. Okay; I'm going - I'm on my way to the P52 attitude, which we're gonna get, I guess, here in daylight. That should be no problem. That's why we're gonna do a pulse torque, and I'll open the alpha/X-Ray covers and get the X-Ray on. And at time 51, I'm gonna try to do a Verb 49 to the Moulton attitude, which is 225, 233, and 358, to be there at 170:20. I'll then do those - pictures, and try to start them at 170:28. If I get in attitude, I'm gonna change the DAP to 10102. Then do a maneuver to the anti-solar point at 279, 223, and 356. And those pictures should begin at 170:36. At the conclusion of that sequence, I'll turn the DAP to 10101.
169:28:27|C|Har|Okay. That sounds good, Ken. And at 171 hours, we want to turn the X-Ray to Standby and Close the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover.
169:28:48|T|CMP|Okay, at 171, you want X-Ray to Standby and Close the Alpha/X-Ray Cover.
169:28:53|C|Har|Roger; that's for Sun avoidance.
169:28:59|T|CMP|Roger; thank you.
169:29:14|T|CMP|Okay; is there something that comes after that? Do I go to another attitude, or what?
169:29:23|C|Har|Stand by a minute, Ken.
169:29:28|T|CMP|Okay.
169:30:01|C|Har|Okay, Ken. Following this, we want you to - this attitude'll be good, all the way up to 172:30. And we want you to get an eat period in there. And at 172:15, do a P52.
169:30:19|T|CMP|Okay. Just a second. You caught me without my book.
169:31:15|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Say again those events.
169:31:18|C|Har|Okay. The attitude that you're in at the completion of the Gegenschein will be good for that time until we pick up on the - in the Flight Plan at 172:30 where we marked it up. And the only thing we want you doing in this period is to eat. And at 172:15, do a P52.
169:31:49|T|CMP|Okay. I'll eat, do a P52 at 172:15, and be in the Flight Plan at 172:30.
169:31:56|C|Har|That is affirmative. And for your information, the next AOS is at 171:14.
169:32:06|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, sir.
169:32:25|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, I got 23 frames used on magazine ZZ. I assume that's enough to get me through this new sequence. Right?
169:32:37|C|Har|That's affirmative. That should be a seven-frame sequence.
169:32:44|T|CMP|Okay.
169:33:27|C|Har|And, Ken, for planning purposes, we're gonna delete your suit donning for the rendezvous, so you won't have to be worried about that.
169:33:39|T|CMP|Okay. All right. That'll unclutter the time a great deal. Thank you.
169:37:30|T|CMP|Can I go ahead and open the Alpha cover?
169:37:41|C|Har|Stand by.
169:38:01|C|Har|Roger; go ahead, Ken.
169:38:06|T|CMP|Okay. That baby's open.
169:40:52|T|CMP|That ought to get your attention, shouldn't it?
169:40:58|C|Har|Roger.
169:42:00|T|CMP|Okay, the X-Ray is On.
169:42:10|C|Har|Copy.
169:45:36|T|CMP|Well, we finally got a little serendipity, Hank.
169:45:40|C|Har|How's that?
169:45:41|T|CMP|I was almost in the right attitude to start with. Hey, now, would you guys, in a little bit, not look? It sure is nice to get somewhere more than a minute before you have to be there. And we're all set up. I got the window shade up and the camera installed, and we're all ready to go.
169:46:49|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We'd like you to configure for a SIM bay jett.
169:46:58|T|CMP|Okay.
169:47:11|T|CMP|Got it.
169:47:23|C|Har|And, Casper, could you Reacquire on the High Gain? We're having a little trouble. Pitch, minus 30; Yaw, 80.
169:47:48|T|CMP|How's that?
169:47:50|C|Har|Hey, that looks good.
169:51:16|T|CMP|Hank, just out of curiosity, all this - minor material that's sticking up through the mare down here has that same little bench on it that I described at Riphaeus Mountains. That includes some of these circular craters that are sticking up.
169:51:37|C|Har|Roger; that sounds pretty interesting.
169:51:45|T|CMP|It has both a different color, and I think it has a different slope. But it looks just like a high-water mark on them, because everything around here is uniform.
169:52:02|C|Har|Roger. Are you talking about the swirls?
169:52:08|T|CMP|Twirls? No, sir. I'm talking about these little benches that are on the side of every piece of material that sticks up through the mare surface.
169:52:17|C|Har|Roger.
169:58:43|C|Har|Casper, Houston. After you get the Alpha particle/X-Ray cover door closed at 171 hours, you can go back to coupled RCS.
169:58:59|T|CMP|Okay, let's see. After I close the door at 171, then you want me to go back to couples.
169:59:07|C|Har|We want you that way at LOS so FDO'll get some good tracking on you.
169:59:15|T|CMP|Okay.
170:02:41|T|CMP|Hank?
170:02:47|C|Har|You call, Ken?
170:02:52|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I'd like to verify what I'm supposed to be pointing at. It doesn't look like - you've got the camera in the 30-degree position according to the checklist. And it was my understanding that mark on my checklist on that star chart was the Moulton point, and it doesn't appear to me that my camera is pointing at that spot.
170:03:15|C|Har|Stand by.
170:03:25|C|Har|Okay. The checklist calls for the camera in the X position.
170:03:27|T|CMP|Looks to me like my camera is pointing about Gienah.
170:03:39|T|CMP|Oh, there it is. Okay. Now I'm glad we checked that.
170:08:00|T|CMP|Hank, it still looks to me like I'm pointing closer to Spica than I am to Antares.
170:08:10|C|Har|Ken, FAO's verified that attitude, and they say it's good.
170:08:16|T|CMP|Okay. That's fine then.
170:13:33|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're a little over 2 minutes from LOS, and everything's looking good. INCO's got your recorder.
170:13:42|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much.
171:04:58|T|CMP|Hello, Houston.
171:05:00|C|Har|Hello, Casper. How's it going?
171:05:05|T|CMP|Oh, we're still here. Done all our chores. Got your SIM bay buttoned up. We're in couples; and, in lieu of anything else, I just switched to Wide Deadband just - because it didn't seem like there was any reason not to.
171:05:24|C|Har|Okay.
171:05:35|T|CMP|I understand from your comment last time, Hank, that there are no other activities tentatively scheduled until the rendezvous sequence starts, so I can go ahead and start stowing things and getting set up for that in the next ...
171:05:54|C|Har|Roger, Ken. The only thing scheduled is that P52 about an hour from now.
171:06:02|T|CMP|Okay. And I got you a P52 on the last pass if that'll help. And I used starts 27 and 31, and the torquing angles were plus 0.108, plus 0.061, plus 0.001, and I torqued that at time 170:59:30.
171:06:29|C|Har|Roger, copy. Okay, you can delete the P52 an hour from now, then.
171:06:40|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
171:06:54|T|CMP|And the plan is still to do the nominal rendezvous sequence up through bringing some of the basic equipment over, and then power down, and we'll jettison the LM tomorrow. Is that correct?
171:07:11|C|Har|That's affirmative, Ken. That's still the plan.
171:07:18|T|CMP|Okay.
171:07:33|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We're riding right at the edge of the High Gain scan limit; we would like for you to roll left 15 degrees.
171:07:43|T|CMP|Okay. Roll left 15.
171:09:52|T|CMP|Okay, Henry. Is that angle gonna be all right now?
171:09:58|C|Har|Roger, Ken. That's good.
171:14:51|C|Har|Casper, Houston.
171:14:55|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
171:14:57|C|Har|I got some updates for you in the Flight Plan, back in Table [sic - means Page] 2-15, the transfer-after-docking table; Table Number 2-8, Page 2-15.
171:15:11|T|CMP|Okay, could you just - could you stand by for just a minute?
171:15:16|C|Har|Will do.
171:15:58|T|CMP|Okay. Where's this now, Hank?
171:16:02|C|Har|Roger. In the table, under item Number 8.
171:16:12|T|CMP|(Chuckle) Well. Tell me the page again.
171:16:16|C|Har|Oh, it's Page 2-15; it's transfer-after-docking table - Table 2-8.
171:16:36|T|CMP|Okay.
171:16:38|C|Har|Okay; under Item 8, where - We want to delete the LCG plugs; the PGA electrical connector covers, and the neck-ring dust covers. Those three items will be on the suits. And delete the DSEA. They'll take care of that tomorrow.
171:17:06|T|CMP|Okay. I take it from that they're coming up unsuited.
171:17:17|C|Har|They're gonna take their suits off in the LM, Ken.
171:17:23|T|CMP|Oh, I see what you mean. Okay.
171:17:26|C|Har|And the - the rest of these deletions are because they'll be taken care of tomorrow, also. Delete Item Number 12. And on the next page -
171:17:40|T|CMP|Okay.
171:17:41|C|Har|- Item Number 15, delete the second and third lines. And delete Items 26, 27, and 28.
171:18:13|T|CMP|Okay. Let's see if I got all that, now. I got - under Item 8, delete the LCG plugs, the PGA pocket, contents, the neck-ring dust covers, and the DSEA. I deleted Item 12. I deleted the second and third lines of Item 15. I deleted Number 26, 27, and 28.
171:18:37|C|Har|That's affirmative.
171:18:22|T|CMP|Okay.
171:20:25|C|Har|And, Casper, I have two P24 pads for you, whenever you're ready. The first one is at 173:20, in the Flight -
171:20:32|T|CMP|Okay.
171:20:35|C|Har|- Plan.
171:20:39|T|CMP|This is after the numbers have been changed, right?
171:20:22|C|Har|That's affirmative.
171:20:47|T|CMP|Okay, how far - let me see here how far ahead I need to change the numbers. I better do that right now, so we don't get - at first.
171:20:55|C|Har|Okay. That's at the old 169:20.
171:21:01|T|CMP|Well, we're gonna - Let's all talk in the - in the real GETs and I'll change my numbers in the book right now.
171:21:08|C|Har|Okay. 173:20.
171:21:50|T|CMP|Okay. I'll copy those numbers down.
171:21:59|C|Har|Okay. And all of these are at 173 hours plus, Ken; so T1 is 173 plus 15:02, 19:52, 21:32, 22:20; south 10 nautical miles.
171:22:26|T|CMP|Okay. And I guess we got another one over here at 173:50.
171:22:37|C|Har|That's affirmative. They're all 173 for the first number. T1 is 39:18, 44:08, 45:48, 46:36; north 1 nautical mile.
171:23:02|T|CMP|Okay. For Descartes, 173:39:18, 44:08, 45:48, 46:36, north 1. F-1, 173:15:02, 19:52, 21:32, 22 - that's 22:20 for T3, and south 10.
171:23:28|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
171:23:28|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 171 hours, 36 minutes [171:24]. We're continuing to experience the noisy communications that we'd had to Orion on the lunar surface, due to the fact that we don't have the LM steerable antenna, the High Gain more directional antenna and we're using the Omnidirectional antennas on the Lunar Module. At about 173 hours [172:48] or a little bit beyond that we'll be able to cover the landing site with the 210-foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California. And we'd expect the noise on the circuit to drop somewhat at that time. While the crew on the lunar surface, Young and Duke, have been busy with their third Extra Vehicular Activity, Ken Mattingly has also been active aboard the Command Module, Casper, completed the plane change maneuver at 169 hours, 17 minutes, 39 seconds [169:05]. Flight Director Don Puddy, who's been following the CSM's activities says that the maneuver was almost precisely as planned; 124.7 feet per second change in velocity, this was a 7-second burn with the spacecraft Service Propulsion engine. And changed the plane of Casper's orbit a little over 1 and 1/3rd degrees and placing it in the proper position for rendezvous with the Lunar Module. The current CSM orbit is 65 by 55 nautical miles. For Ken Mattingly, this is a relatively quiet revolution there letting him have a break from his scientific duties, getting the Command Module cleaned up and ready to go - ready for the rendezvous and docking with Orion. And the subsequent large amount of material that will be transferred from the Lunar Module to the Command Module. The LM lift-off is currently scheduled to occur at 175 hours, 43 minutes, 30 seconds [175:31] Ground Elapsed Time. We have about 48 minutes left before we lose radio contact with Mattingly in the Command Module and he's now coming up approaching the Descartes landing site, he'll be passing over that in the next few minutes. At 171 hours, 39 minutes [171:27]; this is Apollo Control, Houston; continuing to monitor activities aboard Orion on the lunar surface.</p>     <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 171 hours, 36 minutes [171:24].

171:26:33|C|Har|Casper, Houston. For your planning, I don't know whether it's been passed up or not, but no TV for rendezvous or docking.
171:26:44|T|CMP|Oh, okay. No, I hadn't gotten that.
171:27:03|C|Har|The reason for that, Ken, is that the - the television interferes with the LM comm. They've been having a comm problem there with their steerable.
171:27:14|T|CMP|Okay. Well, that's one less big item to not have to unstow.
171:30:11|C|Har|Casper, Houston. While you're working there, I'll just read you part of a little note I got from Farouk in the backroom. He says that "We feel that your descriptions of the visual targets have been very accurate and extremely significant." Also, concerning your comments on the site, the traverse planning troops were very happy to have them, and many of your comments were taken into consideration in planning EVAs 2 and 3.
171:30:42|T|CMP|Thank you. That's awfully kind.
171:36:28|T|CMP|Hey, Hank.
171:36:30|C|Har|Go ahead.
171:36:34|T|CMP|How about giving me a call about 5 minutes before we pass over the landing site and about 5 minutes before we hit the Riphaeus Mountains.
171:36:47|C|Har|Will do.
171:37:38|C|Har|Ken, I think you just passed the landing site.
171:37:43|T|CMP|Oh. Okay. Well, better luck next time. How about the Riphaeus Mountains, then?
171:37:50|C|Har|Okay. I'll give you a call 5 minutes prior.
171:43:33|C|Har|Casper, Houston. You're approximately 5 minutes from the mountains.
171:43:40|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much.
171:48:50|T|CMP|Sorry about that.
171:49:05|C|Har|What's that you're sorry about, Ken?
171:49:12|T|CMP|Oh, the camera got the Velcro on the lip mike and caught it in the Velcro on the back of the camera. I thought it was probably making a lot of noise at you.
171:49:22|C|Har|We could hear the camera cycling.
172:01:16|T|CMP|Hank, before I throw out the electrophoresis, I'd like to verify that's still the intention.
172:01:22|C|Har|Okay. I'll have them check on it.
172:02:09|C|Har|That's still in the plan, Ken.
172:02:13|T|CMP|Okay.
172:03:27|C|Har|Casper, Houston. I know you're gonna love these words, but I got one more Flight Plan change.
172:03:38|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Hang on a second and I'll be with you. Let me get things tied down. Well, it looks like that last - last month of training was well worthwhile.
172:04:54|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Read away.
172:04:56|C|Har|Okay. First one is at 173:50.
172:05:09|T|CMP|Okay.
172:05:19|T|CMP|Go ahead.
172:05:25|C|Har|Okay. At - Does it say something there about a Verb 49 maneuver to a P52 COAS cal? That's after that. 173:55. Want to change that attitude to 180, 255, 357?
172:05:44|T|CMP|Okay, that COAS cal attitude will be 180, 255, 357.
172:05:49|C|Har|Roger. And the high gain angles are minus 75, 249.
172:06:00|T|CMP|Okay. Minus 75 and 249.
172:06:03|C|Har|Okay. Next page, 174:09; delete the configure for urine jump - dump, and the H<sub>2</sub> Purge Line Heaters, On.
172:06:17|T|CMP|Okay.
172:06:18|C|Har|Same page, at the bottom, 174:28. Delete the fuel cell purge and the dumps.
172:06:30|T|CMP|Okay, that's done.
172:06:32|C|Har|Next page at 174:36, starting with CM4 TV bracket. Delete all through don PGA.
172:06:53|T|CMP|Okay. I ought to be well ahead by then. If you'd like for me to wear the suit, why, it's no problem. I'm not requesting to wear it, but if you'd like for me to, why, it's no sweat.
172:07:07|C|Har|Not required, Ken. That takes some time out after the docking, Ken. That helps that time line.
172:07:24|T|CMP|Okay. Anything there is a big help.
172:07:26|C|Har|Okay. At 175:13.
172:07:29|T|CMP|Okay. I got those deletions. Go ahead.
172:07:34|C|Har|At AOS, we want to change the angles there to minus 75, 249; and put these Reacq and Wide. And this Reacq and Wide's gonna help the LM comm.
172:07:52|T|CMP|Okay.
172:07:54|C|Har|At 177:19 -
172:08:06|T|CMP|Say again the time?
172:08:08|C|Har|177:19.
172:08:20|T|CMP|Okay.
172:08:21|C|Har|Delete TV, on. And anywhere else in there you run across that TV, just delete it.
172:08:32|T|CMP|All righty.
172:08:33|C|Har|And the last change is at 178 hours, at the top of the page.
172:08:45|T|CMP|Okay.
172:08:46|C|Har|P20, Option 5, minus-X forward SIM bay attitude. I'll get you your deadband on that in a second. Following that, "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open. Alpha Particle, On" -
172:09:10|T|CMP|Hey, you give me minus-X - Start that whole P20 thing again, Hank.
172:09:20|C|Har|Okay. It's P20, option 5, minus-X forward. That's the SIM bay attitude.
172:09:27|T|CMP|Okay. And do you say you do not have a deadband yet?
172:09:33|C|Har|Three degrees.
172:09:38|T|CMP|Say again?
172:09:40|C|Har|Noun 79 will be a 3-degree deadband.
172:09:45|T|CMP|Okay.
172:09:47|C|Har|Okay. "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open. Alpha Particle experiment, Alpha On. X-Ray, On. Gamma Ray, Deploy. Mass Spec, Deploy." And after the Mass Spec is Deployed, "Mass Spec Experiment, On. Ion Source, Standby.
172:10:33|T|CMP|Okay. Got all that. P20, Option 5, minus-X; 3-degree deadband, the Alpha Door comes Open, the Alpha comes On; the X-Ray comes On; the Gamma goes out; the Mass Spec goes to Deploy; the Mass Spec Experiment comes On when it is Deployed, and Ion Source to Standby.
172:10:49|C|Har|That's a good readback, Ken. That should take you on up past rendezvous and docking.
172:10:56|T|CMP|(Laughter) You care to have a little friendly wager?
172:11:07|C|Har|Negative, because I just got another change, if you'll flip back a page to the 177:55?
172:11:17|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay, go ahead.
172:11:22|C|Har|Want to delete the Verb 49 maneuver to LM jets since we're not doing that tonight.
172:11:32|T|CMP|Okay.
172:11:38|C|Har|And that's about revision U - Uniform, I'll have Victor for you here shortly, probably.
172:11:49|T|CMP|Okay, no sweat. Whenever you get it, give me a call. Meanwhile, I'll be picking up toys here.
172:12:18|C|Har|Casper, you're looking good going around the hill, and INCO has your recorder.
172:12:26|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much. I'll see you in a few minutes.
172:12:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 172 hours 24 minutes [172:12]. That was John Young reporting that they have a problem with dirt in connectors. He's advising us that they plan to remove their helmets sc that they can blow the dirt out of the suit connectors, and get everything fitting in tightly. At the present time Young and Duke are getting the cabin back in order, getting equipment stowed, and preparing to jettison equipment that they will not need further - such things as the Portable Life Support Systems. They'll open the hatch and deposit this unneeded equipment on the Lunar surface. That time in the Flight Plan is around 172 hours 30 minutes [172:18]. We're running a little bit behind. It'll probably come out closer to 173 hours. And at the present time Ken Mattingly aboard the CSM Casper is nearing the end of his 50th revolution of the Moon. We're just about to lose radio contact with that vehicle. It's been a quiet revolution for Mattingly. Flight Director, Don Puddy, advised that this period had been intentionally left open so that Mattingly could get the Command Module cabin in order to receive all of the rocks and other equipment from the Lunar Module, including the two passengers. And also to get everything set up for the rendezvous and docking, which will occur on the 52nd and 53rd revolutions of the Moon. As we mentioned previously we do not expect to get television of the docking. This was originally scheduled, however, it has to be dropped because of the fact the Lunar Module steerable antenna is not working. With this situation it becomes necessary for the Command Module while the two vehicles are operating separately and in close concert such as they will be during the rendezvous and docking procedures. It becomes necessary to operate the Command Module with its Omni Directional antennas, rather than with the High Gain antenna, so that we don't block the receivers at the Manned Spaceflight network station while we have one vehicle operating with a much greater signal strength than the other as we found out prior to the landing. We tend to get better saturation in the receivers in order to keep this balance proper and to avoid that sort of problem, the two vehicles will be operated in a rendezvous and docking stage using comparable signal strengths and comparable antennas. And we therefore will not be able to get the television. The signal strength will simply be too low for a good television transmission.</p> <a name=172_13></a>     <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 172 hours 24 minutes [172:12].

173:03:13|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Reading you weak and noisy.
173:03:45|T|CMP|Hello, Houston. Do you read?
173:03:47|C|Har|Casper, Houston. I'm reading you very weak with lots of noise. Over.
173:04:11|C|Har|Casper, Omni Delta.
173:04:44|T|CMP|Houston, do you read Casper?
173:04:48|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Reading you very weak. If you read, go Omni Delta.
173:06:20|T|CMP|Houston, can you read Casper? Over.
173:06:26|C|Har|Casper, Houston. How do you read?
173:07:00|C|Har|Casper, DAC on.
173:07:46|T|CMP|Houston, how do you read Casper?
173:07:48|C|Har|Casper, Houston. Reading you very weak. Coming up on 10 seconds to T-2.
173:11:02|C|Har|Casper, Omni Delta.
173:11:15|T|CMP|Okay. How about that one?
173:11:17|C|Har|Hey, a lot better now, Ken. We had a bad antenna, I guess, on this acquisition. The mark should have gone on the tape recorder, though.
173:11:31|T|CMP|Okay, I - The tape recorder wasn't running. So I started it on Low Bit Rate for you.
173:11:37|C|Har|Thank you.
173:12:38|C|Har|Ken, for your information, the LM is not going to do a P22.
173:12:45|T|CMP|Okay: thank you.
173:15:04|C|Har|Casper, Houston. It looks like we got a - about 10 minutes here or so that's free. I got Flight Plan change Victor here.
173:15:17|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Let me make one quick note on what I marked on there and - on F-1 and I'll - be with you.
173:15:31|C|Har|Okay.
173:15:32|T|CMP|That's an awfully big target to be marking on. So I picked a little target on the side of it.
173:16:14|T|CMP|Okay. I'm ready for change Victor.
173:16:18|C|Har|Okay. And for your information, Ken, the stowage for the items transferred from the LM to the CSM will be nominal. First change is at 179:20. And guess we should have brought that page up to add the 4 hours to.
173:16:39|T|CMP|179:20. I did that. That's 79:20. Go ahead.
173:16:51|C|Har|Okay, just to make sure we're at the right place, that's the old 175:20.
173:16:58|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
173:17:00|C|Har|Okay. At that place -
173:17:02|T|CMP|Big blank area right there.
173:17:03|C|Har|Right. At that place put, "On LM request, connect LM/CM umbilical and transfer over to the CSM.
173:17:33|T|CMP|Okay. "On LM request connect the LM/CM umbilical and transfer power to the LM" at 179:20.
173:17:42|C|Har|Roger. At 179:45, "Close LM hatch -
173:17:48|T|CMP|And?
173:17:52|C|Har|Hatch installation decal, LM Tunnel Vent valve to LM/CM Delta-P; tunnel lights, off.
173:18:29|T|CMP|Okay. You want to close the LM hatch, and I take it you want to install the Command Module hatch.
173:18:36|C|Har|That's -
173:18:37|T|CMP|And we'll do a LM/CM Delta-P for the position, and the tunnel lights off.
173:18:24|C|Har|Roger. And delete the update block, the weight block, and the Verb 40 load - Verb 48 load. And right under that, put "Mass Spec Ion Source, On.
173:19:08|T|CMP|Okay. All right, go ahead.
173:19:11|C|Har|That's right under where I had the Verb 48. This is 280 hours but - just to get it in there. Mass Spec Ion Source, On. VHF AM B, Off, Center." And begin the eat period.
173:19:34|T|CMP|Okay. Now somewhere I need to load the - the LM weight into CS - add it to the CSM weight. Or at least I have the LM weight on there for the DAP. Let's see - Is that already taken care of? You're gonna give me a LM weight sometime earlier. So it will be covered. Okay.
173:20:02|C|Har|Okay, that ought to occur right after docking, Ken.
173:20:10|T|CMP|Yeah, I got it. Okay.
173:20:14|C|Har|Okay. You can start turning pages now, I guess, and we want to - at the old 176, we want to scrub that whole page. Actually, we are gonna scrub everything from 176 on up through 181 up - well, up to 181. So page 176, 176:30, scrub those two columns. On the next page, the 177, the -
173:20:45|T|CMP|You're not gonna want to use them again tomorrow?
173:20:48|C|Har|Negative. They say not. Don't scrub them too heavily.
173:21:01|T|CMP|Okay. I don't want to copy all that over again tomorrow (laughter).
173:21:05|C|Har|At this point, let's just skip over them -
173:21:07|T|CMP|Yeah, we won't do anything ...
173:21:17|C|Har|Okay. Anyhow, go on over to 181 hours. And this is the real -
173:21:28|T|CMP|Okay, 181 -
173:21:29|C|Har|- 181. What it says right there in your Flight Plan. And put LiOH canister change -
173:21:36|T|CMP|Okay, and that's the same for both, huh?
173:21:39|C|Har|That's affirmative.
173:21:42|T|CMP|LiOH change?
173:21:44|C|Har|Roger; 15 into Bravo. Stow 12 in Alfa 3.
173:21:55|T|CMP|Okay.
173:21:57|C|Har|And if you want to write "Hallelujah" or something in there, we're back on the nominal plan again.
173:22:05|T|CMP|(Laughter)
173:22:09|C|Har|Still in the morning. You notice -
173:22:10|T|CMP|(Laughter) I think that's called a champion event.
173:22:12|C|Har|Roger. We just got in there for the rest period.
173:22:18|T|CMP|(Laughter) Well, I'm glad you didn't decide to scrub that one.
173:22:28|C|Har|And that's it for right now, Ken.
173:22:33|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. I'll go back and see if I can pick up the - Orion and the landing site.
173:22:41|C|Har|Okay.
173:23:07|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. One of the things we didn't talk about was I got 509 running now, and I'm gonna turn it off when I finish this next P24. Does that sound alright?
173:23:18|C|Har|Stand by.
173:23:37|C|Har|that's a good plan, Ken.
173:27:18|C|Har|Ten seconds to T-2 - T-1.
173:27:25|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
173:28:24|C|Har|Casper, are you gonna do the comm check with the LM?
173:28:31|T|CMP|Okay. It has another minute or so.
173:29:28|T|CMP|Orion, Casper on Victor Hotel. How do you read? Over.
173:30:09|T|CMP|Orion, this is Casper. Over.
173:30:23|C|Har|Ken, they should be configured here in just a second.
173:30:36|T|CMP|Hello, Orion. You got the combination. Good afternoon.
173:30:41|T|CDR|Okay, Casper. This is Orion. How do you read? Over.
173:30:44|T|CMP|Loud and clear, John.
173:31:00|T|CMP|Orion, this is Casper. Reading you loud and clear.
173:31:04|T|CDR|Okay, I'm not reading him.
173:31:15|T|CMP|Loud and clear, John. How me?
173:31:24|C|Har|Casper. DAC on.
173:31:29|T|CMP|Loud and clear, John. How me?
173:31:35|T|CDR|Roger. We read you 5 by, Ken. With a little squeal.
173:31:42|T|CMP|Okay. You're loud and clear, Charlie.
173:31:46|T|LMP|How's things up there?
173:31:48|T|CMP|Oh, just fine. Smile, I'm gonna take your picture here in a minute.
173:31:52|T|CDR|Good show.
173:31:59|C|Har|Casper, the DAC should be running.
173:32:04|T|CMP|DAC is running.
173:32:12|C|Har|And you're coming up on 10 seconds to T-2.
173:32:19|T|CMP|Okay.
173:32:44|T|CMP|Man, that's hard to see in this sunlight.
173:33:19|T|CMP|Okay. On target.
173:33:30|T|CMP|In this Sun angle, that Flag and Spook are hard to see until you are right on top of them.
173:34:19|T|CMP|Okay, on target. By this Sun angle, that Flag and Spook are hard to see until you're right on top of them.
173:39:15|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We've got a bunch of pads to get up to you. The first one I've got for you is your - a range update, whenever you're ready to copy.
173:39:29|T|CMP|A range update.
173:39:30|C|Har|Roger. The - the - ranges that you have are a little bit in error. I'd like to give you the correct ones, so that when you compare your ranging, it'll look more better to you.
173:39:46|T|CMP|You mean the nominal ranges in the rendezvous profile?
173:39:51|C|Har|That's affirmative, sir.
173:39:55|T|CMP|Oh, okay. All righty.
173:40:00|C|Har|Okay. Range at insertion should be 171 nautical miles.
173:40:15|T|CMP|Okay, that'll be 171. Ready.
173:40:20|C|Har|insertion plus 6 is 142.
173:40:31|T|CMP|Okay.
173:40:33|C|Har|Omni Alfa, Casper.
173:40:42|T|CMP|You've got it.
173:40:43|C|Har|Okay. Insertion plus 9 is 129.
173:41:00|C|Har|And insertion plus 12 is 120.
173:41:12|T|CMP|Okay, let's see, that's - those aren't the same figures I've got in here, are they?
173:41:25|C|Har|They should be about 15 miles different as I understand.
173:41:35|T|CMP|Hey, what was the last one you gave me? Insertion plus how much?
173:41:39|C|Har|Plus 12. And it was 120.
173:41:43|T|CMP|Okay.
173:42:02|T|CMP|Mattingly:</b> Okay.
173:42:06|C|Har|And I have that big bug-a-boo, the P27 update.

173:48:01|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
173:48:05|T|CMP|Amazing.
173:48:08|C|Har|And if you'll give us Accept and bring up the high gain, we'll get your state vector up.
173:51:10|C|Har|Casper, I have a correction to that range update I gave you.
173:51:19|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by just a second.
173:51:34|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
173:51:36|C|Har|Roger. The Insertion plus 12 should read 116.
173:51:52|T|CMP|Okay. Plus 12 is 116.
173:51:55|C|Har|Okay, I owe you a consumables status. Everything's great there. We're nominal. And on the RCS, we're 153 pounds over the redline.
173:52:07|T|CMP|Okay.
173:52:09|C|Har|And the CSM weight that's stored in the CSM - CMC is okay.
173:52:21|T|CMP|All right.
173:52:31|T|CMP|You want to give me a hack at the LM weight, or I'll just guess at 5900 again.
173:52:41|C|Har|Stand by, Ken.
173:53:00|C|Har|LM weight is 5953
173:53:05|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
173:55:18|C|Har|Casper, you can terminate the BAT B charge now.
173:55:24|T|CMP|Okay. Battery B charge is off.
173:56:03|C|Har|Casper, the computer's yours
173:56:09|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
173:58:04|C|Har|Casper, I have an ascent pad for you.
173:58:09|T|CMP|Okay, stand by.
174:00:01|C|Har|Okay. You got the numbers?
174:00:18|C|Har|We got the angles, Ken. Torque them.
174:00:35|C|Har|You copy, Casper? You're clear to torque?
174:00:41|T|CMP|Roger. Torqued.
174:02:04|T|CMP|Hey, Hank. Do we have enough time to let me take a look at this COAS star, or do you want to get your pad first?
174:02:15|C|Har|Okay, we've got about 10 minutes to LOS.
174:02:22|T|CMP|Okay, Ed. We're in good shape then, because the star is right here.
174:02:25|C|Har|Okay. Why don't you press ahead with the COAS?
174:02:28|T|CMP|Okay. All righty. I'll be done with it in just a jiffy.
174:04:06|T|CMP|That's pretty close, isn't it?
174:04:10|C|Har|Roger.
174:04:11|T|CMP|Okay, I'm ready to copy your pad.

177:13:34|C|Irw|- Ken, we want you to do the - Ken, do the Verb 49 maneuver to the SIM bay attitude per Flight Plan and then do the 360-degree roll and, of course, following that, you do the Verb 49 maneuver to the docking attitude. Then I have a change for the Flight Plan whenever you're ready to copy.
177:13:57|T|CMP|Okay. We're in perfect position to take pictures of the LM right now. All they've got to do is to pitch. He prefers to go to the other sequence, is that correct?
177:14:08|C|Har|Okay. If you're in a position to take pictures of the LM we wanted the LM to do a 360-degree yaw, and you're to take pictures of the - the minus-Z portion of the ascent stage, using the same camera setting that you have on the DAC and the EL, except the focus on the EL should be changed to infinity. Over.
177:14:37|T|CMP|Okay, we'll just take you up on that, Hank, and take pictures of the - where's minus Z? Let's see that's - that's -
177:14:46|C|Har|Okay. Ken, it's the back side of the LM.
177:14:53|T|CMP|Roger. I'm with you and I'll turn the DAC on, and I'll a - fix the EL ... station-keeping now.
177:15:03|C|Irw|Okay. And, Ken, if you observe anything there, will you please relay your observations?
177:15:14|T|CMP|Yes, sir; certainly will.

177:15:37|C|Irw|I understand a portion of the MESA blanket's still on the - on the front.
177:15:45|T|LMP|Yeah, that might have been what you saw. It came pretty high in the air and it went straight out to the west.
177:15:51|C|Irw|Okay. We copy.
177:15:56|T|CMP|Okay, everything on the plus-Y side looks clean - just the surface is a little flaky with paint ...

177:16:22|C|Irw|Orion, will you go Forward Omni?
177:16:23|T|CMP|... it looks like the - the -
177:16:36|T|CMP|Looks like some of the thermal blanket around the ECAs ["Descent Engine" in LM transcript.] on the back end there is pretty badly chewed up.
177:16:46|C|Irw|Okay. We copy.
177:16:47|T|CMP|Some of the stuff is torn - a couple of panels are torn off. And some of the stripping in between it is - it looks like it was struck by something, but it looks like all the mylar blankets underneath are still intact.

177:17:40|T|CMP|No, sir; it's not possible from the back; I can't tell about the bottom; but, on the back side, the Mylar blankets are still intact - it's only that outer covering that's broken.

177:20:06|T|CMP|Hey, Charlie, have you got a Forward VHF there?
177:20:12|T|CMP|Okay, the things I'd like for you to look at are - you remember on the aft shelf of the SIM bay, there's two booms back there.
177:20:21|T|CMP|The one on my - the most- plus-Y one is the Mass Spec - It's got a white cover and it - it's kind of a rectangular shape cover. The one on the left or - it's really in about the center of the SIM bay - at the aft end and it has a silver cover and that's the Gamma Ray. Would you take a look and see if either of the covers are not quite closed because we have indications in the spacecraft that they're not closed and indications on the ground that they are.
177:20:57|T|LMP|[Young in LM transcript] Are you maneuvering, Ken?

177:31:17|T|CMP|Well, I got about 10 degrees in pitch.
177:31:29|T|CMP|Houston, did you ...?
177:31:39|T|CDR|Houston. Casper wants the Logic Go and Omni.
177:31:44|C|Irw|Roger; you're Go.
177:31:50|T|CDR|Yeah, they gave you Go, Ken.
177:31:58|C|Irw|Casper, Omni Alpha.
177:32:14|C|Irw|Casper, let's hold up on the Pyro A.
177:32:35|T|CMP|Yes, sir. I thought you just gave me a Go; but I guess not.
177:32:49|C|Irw|Okay. Casper, let's take the Logics, Off, and we'll go through it again.
177:32:55|T|CMP|Okay. Logics, Off.
177:32:58|C|Irw|Stand by.
177:33:14|C|Irw|Say, Ken. You're Go for Pyro Arm - I'm sorry, Logics, On.
177:33:18|T|CMP|Okay. The Logics are coming on. There's Number 1, and there's Number 2.
177:33:31|C|Irw|Okay, Casper. You're Go for Pyro Arm.
177:33:37|T|CMP|Okay. Pyro Arms coming on. 1; there's 2.
177:33:46|C|Irw|Roger. Looks good here.
177:34:00|T|CDR|Okay, Ken. You there?
177:34:02|T|CMP|I'm about 5 degrees from it. You can go ahead and start your maneuver, I'll take station-keeping.
177:34:07|T|CDR|Okay. You have it.
177:35:32|T|CMP|Okay. I'm approaching. Your attitude looks good.
177:35:40|T|CMP|I'll tell you when we have capture.
177:37:46|T|CMP|Say again.
177:38:58|T|CMP|Okay, about 5 feet.
177:40:37|T|CMP|Doesn't look like it. I don't have any barber poles. There we go. Took a couple of extra blurps to get you. Okay. Are you free?
177:40:52|T|CMP|Okay.
177:41:00|T|CMP|Okay, it looks - looks pretty fair. How about if I just retract you?
177:41:25|T|CMP|I believe we're there.
177:41:27|T|CMP|Casper's captured Orion!
177:41:30|C|Irw|Very good. We were wondering what took you so long.
177:41:35|T|CMP|Yeah, he's all locked on.
177:41:38|T|CDR|We - we were doing these fancy maneuvers up here. Hardly anybody ever gets to do a 360-degree yaw on the Moon.
177:41:52|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We're about 25 minutes to LOS, and I have about five pages of time-line changes, whenever you're ready to copy.
177:42:03|T|CDR|Yes, sir. Charlie's about ready.
177:42:08|C|Irw|And, Orion, you can close the Crossfeed and open A Main SOV.
177:42:36|C|Irw|Casper, let's hold off on the P20. We need good comm to get all these changes up.
177:42:43|T|CMP|Okay. Is this attitude good?
177:42:46|C|Irw|Very good.
177:42:48|T|LMP|Okay, Jim, go ahead.
177:42:51|C|Irw|Okay. Timeline book changes - start on page 13 and change 173:55 to 177:54. And under "Configure S-band," Item 1, change CS - "CSM maneuver to jettison attitude" to "CSM maneuver to SIM bay minus-X forward attitude" and delete "Proceed with prep "et cetera. Over.
177:43:34|T|LMP|Roger. We copy. Go ahead.
177:43:36|C|Irw|Okay. Item 2, delete Item 3, change "Prim" to "Secondary" first line, change "Right" to "Off" and "Hi" to "Lo." Add a second line, "S-Band antenna, Aft"; and delete remainder of Step 3. Add the following: "Exterior Light, Off; perform docked deactivation (staged), Steps 1 to 7 of the Contingency Checklist, page 3-9." Over.
177:44:22|T|LMP|Okay. Delete all of Step 2. That's the "Verify jet attitude." Step 3, sec - "S-Band, Secondary, Off, and Lo." Delete - mixed - all the steerable stuff, and add "External Light - Exterior Light, Off," which it is, and "Docked deactivation (staged), Steps 1 through 7" in the Contingency Book.
177:44:49|C|Irw|Okay. Next is change 1 - 174 hours to 177:59 under "Prep for transfer" and step 3, change line 4 to read "LMP purge valve (1, aft LHSSC)
177:45:30|T|LMP|Okay. That's - all I did was add in "LMP purge valve." All the - all the rest was there.
177:45:36|C|Irw|Okay, I have a - a question here, Charlie, but then, on the next line, it's - under neck ring, they said add "Stow commander's purge valve" - oh, that's "Serial number 194 in ISA bottom pocket.
177:46:00|C|Irw|Okay, your purge valve apparently is serial number 197, and John's is 194. That make sense to you?
177:46:09|T|LMP|Yeah, I got it. I know which one.
177:46:12|C|Irw|Okay, if you've got that, I'm doing a Step 5 - it's delete first two lines. Over.
177:46:24|T|LMP|Hey, we've been using the purge valves interchangeably. I don't know who was using whose when we were out on the Moon.
177:46:33|C|Irw|Okay, we'll talk about that later. Let me get the - the rest of the change to you. Under Step 9, after "SE Audio, Open," add "ECS LCG Pump, Open." Delete remainder of step. Insert the following: "Cabin Gas Return, Open; Suit Circuit Relief to Auto - that's a verify; Suit Isol Valve, both, to Suit Disconnect. Both, disconnect hoses and stow. Both, doff suits - suits, install PGA electrical connector covers from the purse, and stow LCG plugs in suits from the purse. Install neck ring dust covers in the purse. Transfer suit to CMP." Then configure circuit breakers per 3-10 and 11 of Contingency Checklist. Over.
177:47:40|T|LMP|Okay, copy. "Cabin Gas Return," add after "SE Audio, Open." "LCG, Open" - correction, "LCG Pump, Open; Cabin Gas to Open; Suit Circuit Relief to Auto; Suit Disconnect - Suit to Hose Disconnect; doff suits; put on electrical connectors, the LCG plugs, dust covers." And then go to 3-10 for the CBs on Contingency Checklist.
177:48:11|C|Irw|Okay. Then on page 14, step 11, delete "PPKs, three, on the left-hand midsection and the aft SRCs." That's in parentheses. The next item is the flag kit. Next item is flight data file. Then add Timeline Book and LM Contingency Checklist. Over.
177:48:56|T|LMP|Okay. Scratch PPKs, the flag kit, the flight data file, and add the Timeline Book and the Contingency Checklist.
177:49:05|C|Irw|Okay. Step 14, delete. And delete "MSFN up-link, update, target PGNS, and configure AGS, step 1." Over.
177:49:22|T|LMP|Okay, "MSFN up-link, modulate, delete step 1.
177:49:29|C|Irw|Okay, then on page - we'll delete page 15, 16, and 17, and then on page 18, under "IVT to CSM," delete step 2, and prior to "LM to CM transfer list," add "Perform final deactivation per Contingency Checklist, Page 3"...
177:49:55|T|LMP|Hey, hold on a minute - hold on a minute - hold on, Jim.
177:49:58|C|Irw|Okay.
177:50:02|T|CDR|You're going faster than he can move.
177:50:05|T|LMP|I can't turn the pages that fast. I'm on - I've deleted page 16 and 17, and I'm on page 18. Go ahead.
177:50:14|C|Irw|Okay, under "IVT to CSM," delete step 2, and prior to "LM to CM transfer list," add "Perform final deactivation per Contingency Checklist, page 3-12 to 3-15." Over.
177:50:55|T|LMP|Okay, on "IVT to CSM," delete step 2. Perform final deactivation per 3-12 to 15 in Contingency Checklist.
177:51:08|C|Irw|Okay, and then under the transfer list, delete "DSEA, PPKs, flag kits flight data file in the jettison bag, purse and contents, unused food, used urine bag, and used fecal bags." Over.
177:51:39|T|LMP|Okay. We copy that.
177:51:41|C|Irw|Okay. And then go back to Page 14, Charlie. Let me know when you're there. I think we've missed something there.
177:52:02|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
177:52:04|C|Irw|Okay, on the right-hand side of that page, we want to delete, essentially, three blocks there; the "MSFN up-link/update," all the steps under that - the five steps; then the next, "target PGNS"; and then "Configure AGS." All that portion is to be deleted.
177:52:23|T|LMP|Yeah. I got you. Go ahead.
177:52:29|C|Irw|Okay, under "Configure AGS," all those AGS - the four AGS entries there are - are deleted. We pick up there with Step 2.
177:52:39|T|LMP|I got you.
177:52:40|C|Irw|Okay, then the - the following are changes in the LM Contingency Checklist on page 3-9. Step 4, add "Verify" - Do you want me to wait until you get to the Contingency Checklist, Charlie?
177:52:59|T|CDR|Yeah. You - you better wait until he floats over there to it.
177:53:02|C|Irw|Okay. Let me know. We've got 17 minutes to LOS. Shouldn't take us long to go through the Contingency Checklist changes -
177:53:10|T|CDR|What page did you say?
177:53:12|C|Irw|Starting at Page 3-9.
177:53:44|T|LMP|Okay, go ahead.
177:53:46|C|Irw|Okay, on Page 3-9, Step 4, add "Verify" after "Master Arm Off." Then delete "Audio, Commander"; and Step 6, add "Verify" after "Mode Control, Both, Off." Then Step 7, delete first two lines. And then on - why don't you repeat up to that point? Over.
177:54:24|T|LMP|I got it all, Jim. Step 4: "Verify Master Arm, Off"; delete "Audio, Commander; Mode Control, Both, Off, Verify." "Window Shades and Commander transfer," delete. We'll just leave him over here, huh?
177:54:38|T|CDR|Hey; Jim, I - I - I guess I think that to verify the Master Arm, Off, is kind of a silly change to make Charlie copy, if you got 25 pages of that.
177:54:50|C|Irw|No, listen, John; we've just about one more page, and we'll be finished.
177:54:55|T|CDR|Okay.
177:54:56|C|Irw|Okay, on Page 3-10, Secondary Power Amp, Close. And then on Page 3-11 - let me know when you're there.
177:55:20|T|LMP|You speak.
177:55:22|C|Irw|Okay, row 3, SE Audio, Open, and Primary Amp, Open. Row 4, S-Band Antenna, Open. And then we'll go to Page 3-12. Let me know when you're there.
177:55:49|T|LMP|I'm there.
177:55:51|C|Irw|Okay, Step 2, change "Audio, LMP" to "Audio, Both." Change line 2 to read "VHF B and VHF A Transmitter and Receiver, Off." Then Step 4, add, after "Secondary S-Band Transmitter and Receiver, Open," "Secondary Power Amp, Open, and delete "Primary Power Amp, Open." Then Step 5, delete three lines and add "Connect LM/CM umbilicals." Over.
177:56:32|T|LMP|Okay, what was that last one?
177:56:35|C|Irw|The last one was Step 5 to delete three lines and and "Connect LM/CM umbilicals." Over.
177:56:52|T|LMP|Okay, copy.
177:56:58|C|Irw|Okay, then on step 6, under "To use CSM Power," and "LM power dash 1 and LM power dash 2, Main B, circuit breakers, Closed, and CSM- in parentheses." Over.
177:57:32|T|LMP|Okay, we copy.
177:57:34|C|Irw|Okay then, Page 3-13, looks like we just have about three or four more changes here.
177:57:44|T|LMP|Go ahead.
177:57:46|C|Irw|Okay, on 3-13 on - und - under row 3, Open Utility Light. On row 5, open Translunar Bus Tie, and then the next change is on Page 3-14. Over.
177:58:07|T|LMP|Go ahead.
177:58:12|C|Irw|On 3-14, row 2, Open ASA; row 4, Open S-Band Antenna and Translunar Bus Ties. Over.
177:58:30|T|LMP|Roger. Go ahead.
177:58:32|C|Irw|Okay, next, and the last is on Page 3-15, Charlie. Let me know when you're there.
177:58:40|T|LMP|Turn the page; I'm there.
177:58:42|C|Irw|Okay. Step 9, add, after "Ascent Water, Close," "Cabin Gas Return to Egress," and last change is Step 9 - Delete the first line. Over.
177:59:03|T|LMP|I got you.
177:59:05|C|Irw|That's it.
177:59:10|T|LMP|Okay, what's the plan, Jim? Just to power this moose down, and then come back in tomorrow and fire it up again for jettison?
177:59:22|C|Irw|That's affirmative, Charlie, and will you get the AGS Mode Control, Off?
177:59:34|T|LMP|It's Off.
177:59:35|C|Irw|And, Orion, if you'd like, I'll go through the - the basic plan here, post-docking, so it's - be clear in your minds. The first step, of course, is to doff suits in the LM, and, of course, we're going to postpone some of the LM transfer until after you wake up. We're powering down the LM, and we are going to - we're drying out the water boiler. And we'll be ready to close out the LM at - at 179:20. That's AOS plus 10 minutes on this next pass. And then Step 5 is - we'll - y'all will get in the LM tomorrow and complete the transfer and LM jettison, and you will need the LM Timeline Book and the LM Contingency Checklist at docking to accomplish the deactivation. Over.
178:00:29|T|CDR|I got you.
178:01:34|T|CMP|I'll be with you in just a minute.
178:01:47|T|CMP|Okay, I got the drogue out - I mean the probe and the hatch out and I'm ready for the drogue, so if you're going to do anything that affects the pressurization, let me know.
178:02:02|T|CMP|Yeah, I read you.
178:03:03|T|LMP|Houston, Orion. Over.
178:03:05|C|Irw|Go ahead, Orion.
178:03:09|T|LMP|Okay, that first part, "Docked deactivation stage," was that just Steps 1 through 7 or the whole thing?
178:03:17|C|Irw|No, Steps 1 through 7.
178:03:28|T|LMP|Okay.
178:04:27|T|CMP|Yeah, you'll have to open the door and find out.
178:04:41|T|LMP|Okay, Houston -
178:04:42|T|LMP|Mark. Primary Evap Flow is Close.
178:04:45|T|CC|Okay, we copy. And, Casper, you can go into your P20 attitude, minus-X forward.
178:05:00|T|LMP|John verifies that the Master Arm is Off.
178:05:04|T|CC|All right (laughter).
178:05:13|T|CC|And, Casper; this is Houston.
178:05:19|T|CMP|Go ahead.
178:05:20|T|CC|Roger, Ken. We're finished with that update, so you can press on with the minus-X forward.
178:05:28|T|CMP|Okay.
178:10:04|C|Irw|Okay, 16, we're about 30 seconds from LOS. And AOS, 1 -
178:10:14|T|CDR|Okay, when you see us next time, we'll be ...
178:10:18|C|Irw|Okay. And AOS time, 179:08; and your angles are zero - zero and 170.
178:10:30|T|CDR|Okay. Thank you, Jim.

178:59:39|T|CMP|Loud and clear, Jim.
178:59:42|C|Irw|Roger. There's still excessive noise. We can just barely hear you.
178:59:54|T|CMP|Well, we're here.
178:59:56|C|Irw|Okay.
179:00:19|C|Irw|Orion, we'd like for you to switch Omni antennas.
179:02:11|C|Irw|Ken, do you know whether John and Charlie still have their comm carriers on? Are they monitoring comm with us?
179:02:19|T|CMP|No, Jim, they're not. And Charlie just said that he's got a ... bus off-scale low, but the battery looks okay.
179:02:37|C|Irw|Okay. Ken, will you have them close the circuit breaker on Panel 11, Signal Conditioner 1, on row 3?
179:02:46|T|CMP|Okay.
179:03:56|T|CMP|Jim, is there something in particular that you want? I'll see if I can get them for you.

179:07:34|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. We read you loud and clear.
179:07:42|T|LMP|Okay. Somebody wanted me up for comm for some data or something, Jim.
179:07:46|C|Irw|Roger. We just - they just wanted to look at the LM status.

179:08:59|T|LMP|That's right, Jim. It was Closed. I gave you a mark on that.
179:09:03|C|Irw|Roger. I copied.
179:11:27|C|Irw|Orion, this is Houston. Verify that you have Ascent Water selected and verify Primary Evap Flow Number 2, Closed. And verify Descent Water, Closed. Descent Water selected.

179:14:13|T|CC|Okay.
179:14:23|T|CC|And, Orion, this is Houston. Could you tell us where you are in the Timeline Book?
179:14:33|T|LMP|Yeah, I'm putting the buddy - the BSLSS rock bag in the - Ken's stowage thing here.

179:14:54|T|LMP|John's got his suit off. I've still got mine on. And the - everything else has been done.
179:15:02|T|CC|Okay. I'm looking under Step 9. I gave you some changes there, which included configuring circuit breakers per the Contingency Checklist.
179:15:19|T|LMP|No, I haven't done that. I was going to wait until I got my suit off. You want me to do that now?
179:15:24|T|CC|No, just stand by -

179:22:45|T|CMP|Go ahead.
179:22:48|C|Irw|Roger. It's going to take some load to dry out that water boiler. So, don't do Step 9 yet. And, we're thinking of bringing some more equipment back on to reduce that dry-out time. Over.
179:23:09|T|LMP|Roger.
179:23:28|C|Irw|Casper, will you go Auto on High Gain?

179:28:01|T|LMP|Go ahead, Jim.
179:28:03|C|Irw|Roger. A few things that we want you to activate here so put a load on that water boiler. Have five items, if you're ready to copy.
179:28:23|T|LMP|Why don't you just read them to me and I'll turn them on?
179:28:26|T|CC|Good idea. Suit Diverter valve to Cabin.

181:13:08|C|Eng|Okay, Apollo 16. For tomorrow, we'll give you a Flight Plan update in the morning, but just a resumé here. We'll have you wake up at 189:30. That'll give you a good night's sleep, there. And we'll transfer back over the LM and get the rest of the gear back over and activate the LM. Come back to the Command Module and don the suits, and jettison the LM, and jettison the satellite. And towards the end of the day, we'll do a TEI. We've got a plan for using the Mapping Camera and Altimeter most of the - I think it's most of the day. And we have some Pan Camera passes also. We'll get the details on that up tomorrow.
181:14:11|T|CMP|Okay, we're not going home with any blank film, are we, Tony?
181:14:26|C|Eng|Okay, Ken. All the Pan [Camera film] will be used up, but it looks like we'll have several hundred feet of the Mapping Camera [film].
181:14:36|T|CMP|Okay.
181:15:10|T|CDR|Well, one thing about it, Tony with one suit on and one suit off a day, if - you don't have to worry about your exercise periods.
181:15:20|C|Eng|You're not going to wear out the ropes tomorrow, huh?
181:15:32|T|CDR|Doing the suit donning and doffing is the equivalent of wearing out a set of ropes.
181:15:37|C|Eng|I believe it. You guys will be all set for a Houdini act.
181:15:45|T|LMP|Hey, Tony, did - Tony, did you say we get up at 8 - 189:30?
181:15:54|C|Eng|That's affirmative, it's 181:27.
181:16:01|T|LMP|That's amazing. That's what I was just looking at.
181:16:08|C|Eng|Don't you think you can sleep that long? Golly, I'd think you'd sleep 12 hours.
181:16:21|C|Eng|And y'all have an estimate on when you'd be ready to go to bed?
181:16:21|||<p class="tech"><b>181 Id 35 Duke:</b> Probably - I - we just started eating.
181:16:39|C|Eng|Okay. And you can go back to Block, and your EMP is running.
181:17:07|C|Eng|And our plan here is - once you get to bed, we'll do all we can to not disturb you until it's necessary to meet the schedule for tomorrow.
181:17:25|T|CDR|Which is 189:30, right?
181:17:30|C|Eng|We may have to -
181:17:31|T|CDR|If we stay up all night, tomorrow morning we're gonna be awake at 189:30.
181:17:36|C|Eng|Okay.
181:17:43|C|Eng|There's some slop in that, John. We may be able to even slide that some.
181:17:56|T|CDR|I'd just as soon get up a couple of hours earlier and use the Mapping Camera film.
181:18:09|C|Eng|You're really socking it to us here
181:19:23|C|Eng|I wonder if you could give us an estimate on how much time you're going to need in the LM tomorrow before you get to the LM activation.
181:19:42|T|CDR|Around 30 minutes would probably do it, Tony.
181:19:46|C|Eng|Okay.
181:20:24|T|CDR|... tomorrow, this ...
181:21:30|C|Eng|Incidentally, John, you got three dots from the Cape.
181:21:39|T|CDR|Now you're talking.
181:22:24|T|Crew|(Laughter)
181:22:32|C|Eng|Apollo 16, somebody may be on VOX, there. Every once in a while, we have you keying down here.
181:23:58|T|LMP|Thank you, Tony. We appreciate it.
181:24:23|C|Eng|And, Apollo 16, we were a little late on acquisition, there. We'd like you to verify that your High Gains's set up on zero Pitch and Yaw 170.
181:24:39|T|CMP|That's where she is. We saw you with a low signal strength, and -
181:24:50|C|Eng|Okay.
181:24:52|T|CMP|Okay, but we're - we're in Auto instead of React [sic].
181:24:58|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
181:25:01|T|CMP|Which accounts for it.
181:32:07|C|Eng|Okay, Apollo 16, if you have a chance, there, we'd like an E-Mod.
181:32:19|T|CMP|On the way.
181:32:21|C|Eng|Okay.
181:35:14|C|Eng|And, Apollo 16, we've got all we need for the night. Why don't you press on through there and then, your pre-sleep, just record the read-outs. Don't bother sending them down, and we won't bother you anymore. Just hit the sack. See you in the morning.

189:20:01|P|PAO|<b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> That's Ken Mattingly aboard Apollo 16 talking to Capcom Hank Hartsfield here in Mission Control.</p> 				<p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> That's Ken Mattingly aboard Apollo 16 talking to Capcom Hank Hartsfield here in Mission Control.
189:20:40|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Charlie's going off biomed here for a while.
189:20:45|C|Har|Roger.
189:21:17|T|CDR|Ken really had a hard time getting that LiOH canister out last night. He had to wiggle it back and forth about 20 times and go - and come forward and then he'd push it back, come forward, and push it back. Finally got it worked out of there. But what he was worried about and what - what worried me is, is there a possibility of busting that nylon strap on there off? In which case you'd probably never get it out.
189:21:50|C|Har|I don't know, John. I'll question them on that.
189:21:56|T|CDR|Okay. I think I remember breaking off one sometime a long time ago, and I just wondered if they'd beefed that thing up any.
189:22:25|C|Har|16, Houston. Is the A side free?
189:22:35|T|CMP|I just checked them, Hank. They're - they're both okay, now. I had a little trouble getting the one out - let's see, which one was it last night? It was the - it was the B, and I had just a little trouble getting the one out yesterday morning, or whenever it was we made the other change of A. But it was just a little sticky; it wasn't like this. I think we may have had a little extra humidity because the windows are starting to fog up more often now.
189:23:06|C|Har|Roger.
189:23:39|T|CMP|Okay. I killed the jet monitor, and I - I am ready to copy.
189:23:52|C|Har|Okay, Ken. The first change occurs at 189:46 in the Flight Plan.
189:24:08|T|CMP|Okay.
189:24:09|C|Har|Okay. At 189:46 [189:35], add "Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On," and you might make a note there to perform this before opening the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter cover. What we're going to do here is to turn the camera on before we open the door and use the Gamma-Ray Boom as a reference. They want to try to get an idea of what's happening on this extend/retract on the Mapping Camera; and, later on, we'll do the same thing. We'll turn the camera on and retract it all the way with it running and close the door before we turn it off.
189:24:54|T|CMP|Aren't you guys clever? Okay.
189:24:59|C|Har|Okay. At 189:51 [189:40], delete "Image Motion, On; and delete Mapping Camera, On, T-start." Change the "Image Motion, Incr -
189:25:15|T|CMP|Okay, I'd better get my maneuver going here before we do anything, else.
189:25:21|C|Har|Okay. Press on with that, and let me know when you're ready to go again.
189:25:29|T|CMP|Okay. Would you check my Logic Power, on, on 181, please?
189:25:43|C|Har|Yes, sir.
189:25:57|T|CMP|Okay. I didn't think I got to them last night to turn them off.
189:26:00|T|LMP|...
189:26:02|T|CMP|There's two guarded switches down there.
189:26:05|C|Har|Ken, are you on Vox this morning?
189:26:06|T|CMP|On the bottom row. Yeah.
189:26:11|T|LMP|Yes, sir. Thank you.
189:26:29|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. While I'm getting this roll going, why don't you give me some more of that stuff? The last thing I copied was the deletion at 189:50 [189:38] of the Image Motion and the Mapping Camera, On.
189:26:41|C|Har|Okay. And the "Image Motion, Increase", change the "Barber pole" to "Barber pole plus one.
189:26:51|T|CMP|Okay. That's BP plus one.
189:26:53|C|Har|And at 189:57 [189:45], "Charge Battery A.
189:27:07|T|CMP|Okay. Charge Battery A at 189: 57 [189:45].
189:27:13|C|Har|Okay. On the next page, at 190:15 [190:03], P52 -
189:27:19|T|CMP|Before I leave that, Hank, do you have a camera stop time?
189:27:31|C|Har|Stand by one.
189:27:47|C|Har|Casper, would you give us Accept, please?
189:27:52|T|CMP|You have it.
189:27:55|C|Har|Okay. We're going to send you a new state vector; and FAO advises that stop time will be read up with the updates.
189:28:05|T|CMP|Okay.
189:28:17|C|Har|I think - you - you got your roll attitude now?
189:28:23|T|CMP|Yeah. Let me get that straightened out first.
189:29:32|T|CMP|That's good.
189:29:42|T|CMP|Hank, there's no way we're going to make it to this attitude on time.
189:29:48|C|Har|it's not critical, Ken.
189:29:50|T|CMP|I guess that's agreeable with everybody. Okay. But I assume that - we might just as well hold off on this camera extension and all that until daylight. It looks like it's going to be dark or do you want to do that right now while we're -
189:30:37|C|Har|We want to - we want to do it now.
189:30:09|T|CMP|Do that, and get this attitude, and take whatever lighting happens to be out there? Okay.
189:30:19|T|CMP|Okay, let me - it'll work. No, it's still daylight. Make sure. it should be. Yeah. Okay. Get [vox] this dirty?
189:30:51|T|CMP|Yeah, you got it all dirty.
189:31:01|T|CMP|IMC is On; it's barber pole and - gray. The Mapping Camera is coming On -
189:31:13|T|CMP|Mark. The Laser Altimeter door is coming open -
189:21:21|T|CMP|Mark it. Barber pole, gray. Mapping Camera is going to Extend -
189:31:40|T|CMP|Mark. It's barber pole and running. While I'm here, I'll get the Gamma Ray Shield, Off, and the Laser Altimeter, On.
189:32:09|C|Har|Okay, Image Motion is set, and ready to copy some - some more.
189:32:16|C|Har|Okay, at 190:15 [190:03]. Next page. P52, option 3 -
189:32:25|T|CMP|Go ahead.
189:32:27|C|Har|- followed by GDC align.
189:32:38|T|CMP|Okay.
189:32:40|C|Har|Okay. The next thing occurs at 191 hours. I guess you can get it right at the top of that page, "CMP, open LM hatch.
189:32:58|T|CMP|Okay.
189:33:00|C|Har|At 191:05 [190:53], may have to use an arrow to get it in there, "Image Motion, Increase, Barber Pole, On.
189:33:14|T|CMP|Okay. IMC to barber pole at 191:05.
189:33:22|C|Har|Roger. And for planning, about 191:06 [190:54], we plan to start reading up the LM changes if we can get through these. At 191:16 [191:04], from that MSFN up-link black, delete the LOPC target-load information there in the desired orient.
189:33:50|T|CMP|Okay. That's deleted.
189:33:52|C|Har|At 191:16 [191:04], you'll have to use an arrow again -
189:33:55|T|CMP|For planning purposes, what book should the LM guys have available to write in?
189:34:00|C|Har|Okay. The LM Contingency Checklist and the LM Timeline.
189:34:07|T|CMP|Okay. We'll have those out.
189:34:12|C|Har|Okay. 191:16 [191:04], we want the "Image Motion to -
189:34:17|T|CMP|Go ahead.
189:34:18|C|Har|- barber pole plus four.
189:34:23|T|CMP|Okay, BP plus four at 191:16 [191:04].
189:34:28|C|Har|And delete the update block at 191:18 [191:06].
189:34:38|C|Har|High Gain to Auto.
189:34:50|T|CMP|You've got it.
189:34:53|C|Har|Okay, and I'll - stand corrected on that update block. We'll give you a TEI pad there.
189:35:04|T|CMP|Okay.
189:35:06|C|Har|Okay. At 191:33 [191:21], delete everything down to orbital science photos.
189:35:23|T|CMP|Okay. Well, that one I can do.
189:35:26|C|Har|Okay. And at 191:50 [191:38], here's where we're going to close that mapping camera up; I guess the best thing to do is just scratch through all that stuff there and write out to the side the order we want to get it in, which is as follows: "Laser Altimeter, Off; Mapping Camera, Retract; Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Closed - that's after it's retracted, of course - "Mapping Camera, Off." And I think you're at attitude now, Ken, if you want to start your P20. It's not at attitude, stand corrected.
189:36:17|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
189:36:20|C|Har|Yeah, it must have bumped a stick there.
189:36:26|T|CMP|[Vox] Thank you. I'm glad somebody is awake this morning.
189:36:46|C|Har|Okay. After the Mapping Camera Off, wait 22 seconds, Mapping Camera, Standby; IMC Off" They want to do a Verb 49 to the LM comm, deep space measurement attitude to arrive at 192:10 [191:58]. The attitude is 322, 115, 305. High-Gain angles for AOS acq: Pitch, minus 35; Yaw 235. And along about 213:00, beg - Stand corrected - 191:55 [191:43], want to start transferring equipment from the LM.
189:38:10|T|CMP|Okay. Now, give me that time that you've got to be in attitude again, I didn't get that one.
189:38:17|C|Har|One - 192:10 [191:58].
189:38:29|T|CMP|192:10. Okay. And you didn't say anything about the X-Ray. Do you want it to go to Standby?
189:38:43|C|Har|We want to leave the X-Ray, On.
189:38:49|T|CMP|Okay. So all the rest of that block up there, I delete, right?
189:38:52|C|Har|That's affirmative.
189:38:55|T|CMP|And leave the alpha-particle cover open and all that. Okay. I'll just delete all those guys, and let me read you what I have. That's the "Laser Altimeter - Starting at 191:50 [191:38] we'll go "Laser Altimeter, Off; Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter when it's in, the "Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover" is to "Close," the Mapping Camera" then comes "Off" and we go through a little ditty of "33 seconds, Standby; IMC, Off." While we're doing this, we can do a Verb 49 to the attitude 322, 115, 305; AOS High Gain angles will be Pitch, minus 35; Yaw, 235. I need to be in attitude by 192:10 [191:58]. Starting about 191:55 [191:43], you want to start transfer of LM equipment.
189:39:50|C|Har|That's affirmative. Now, if you'll make a little note there, go to 214 hours, Page 323.
189:40:07|T|CMP|Go to - Say again?
189:40:10|C|Har|214 hours, that's on three hundred and - Page 323.
189:40:21|T|CMP|Ah-hah.
189:40:33|T|CMP|Okay.
189:40:36|C|Har|Okay. I'm going to give you both times. If you like, you can write in the - your clock times over these. 214 hours becomes 192:10 [191:58] -
189:40:46|T|CMP|Hey, Hank - Hank, I'm getting - I'm getting confused. Would you give an overall picture, so that I can have some - some perspective of what we're doing. It - it'd sure made it a lot easier. I can copy this line by line, but I'll never - never keep it all straight here if -
189:41:02|C|Har|Okay We're gonna do the items in the Flight Plan up to 192:00 [191:48], and then we're gonna go over to 214 hours in the Flight Plan and pick up these items in there - until we get over to about 216:15. And then we're gonna jump back to 176:55, and pick up the LM jett procedure. And when we get through with that, we're gonna jump back to -
189:41:41|T|CMP|Okay now - just a second -
189:41:42|C|Har|- 217 - for the subsat -
189:41:43|T|CMP|- Wait a minute - wait. Let me absorb what you're saying. Okay, Hank. When you say you're gonna pick up, these things over here at Rev 72, I guess you're looking at all these visual targets and photo targets.
190:42:08|C|Har|Actually, we're scrubbing most that.
189:42:10|T|CMP|And of those - Oh, okay. All right, I was gonna say because we're in - we're on a groundtrack that isn't very compatible with some of those things. Okay, so then you're gonna do that and then you're gonna go back and do the LM jettison, and then come back up to the subsat?
189:42:29|C|Har|Roger. And we're trying to work at a -
189:42:31|T|CMP|Oh, okay.
189:47:33|C|Har|- clock update in here somewhere to get all this to look right.
189:42:37|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay -
189:42:40|T|CDR|That'll be the trick of the year.
189:42:42|T|CMP|Can you do that with a clock sync? You're even better than I thought you were.
189:42:46|C|Har|Nobody down here -
189:42:47|T|CMP|All right, let me -
189:42:48|C|Har|- even knows what time it is now.
189:42:50|T|CMP|- change the - the - Don't tell us things like that. Let me - all right, let me - let's - so we can make sure we're all talking in the same hours, I would like to do like we did the other day and - and correct the - the - times in the Flight Plan that are printed now to be the times that we'll really do it. And then you talk to me in times that we'll really do it and forget what it says in the Flight Plan.
189:43:22|C|Har|Okay. I'll do that.
189:43:24|T|CMP|That worked out real good with the rendezvous. Okay, so now the pages I need to fix the times on are going to be - starting at Page 323.
189:43:34|C|Har|That's affirmative, and 214:00 becomes -
189:43:37|T|CMP|And 214 hours will be -
189:43:39|C|Har|192:10 [191:58].
189:43:43|T|CMP|19 - uh-oh. 192:10?
189:43:47|C|Har|That's affirmative. You have to subtract 21 hours and 50 minutes from these times.
189:43:53|T|CMP|(Laughter) Sim Sup [Simulator Supervisor - ie this is like a simulation] is having a field day. Okay. This will take me a few minutes, but I'll - I'll get there.
189:44:09|C|Har|I'm considering resigning after this shift.
189:44:15|T|CMP|(Laughter) Okay. Just a second, Hank, let me - I'll - I'll get this page done, and then we can work on it, and I'll be right with you.
189:44:42|T|CMP|Okay. let's see.
189:44:56|C|Har|Ken, can we get a Shield, On, Gamma Ray?
189:45:01|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Try 9-A.
189:45:08|T|LMP|It's on, Ken.
189:45:09|T|CMP|Thank you. It's on, Hank.
189:45:25|C|Har|You're at attitude now, Ken.
189:45:31|T|CMP|Thank you.
189:45:50|T|CMP|Hang on a second.
191:45:52|T|LMP|Just a minute, Ken.
189:45:55|T|CMP|How about L-3
189:45:56|T|LMP|L-3
189:46:00|C|Har|Say again, Ken.
189:46:06|T|CMP|I'm sorry. We got - we got a lot of things going on at one time here. Okay. I've got Page 323 times corrected now, if you want to - if you want to correct those - those events before I work on the next page?
189:46:26|C|Har|Okay. At 192:10 [191:58], delete the galactic photo sequence.
189:46:39|T|CMP|Okay.
189:46:42|C|Har|In fact, delete everything in that page, and then, at 192:23, LM activation begins. Actually, everything in the left hand column, I should have said, should be deleted.
189:47:10|T|CMP|Okay. LM activation goes where all that other stuff is.
189:47:14|C|Har|That's affirmative.
189:47:23|T|CMP|Go ahead, Hank.
189:47:25|C|Har|Okay. The next column, all the P20 stuff; and at "Acquire MSFN," the High Gain
189:47:34|T|CMP|Okay. Now, what about this Skylab contamination at the bottom of the page?
189:47:37|C|Har|Delete.
189:47:48|T|CMP|Okay. Start over again now in the next column.
189:27:51|C|Har|Roger. Delete the P20. The MSFN angles are minus 35, yaw, 238.
189:48:08|T|CMP|Okay.
189:48:09|C|Har|Delete the orbital science prep - the configure camera, et cetera, and the orbital science. At 192:55 [191:43] there, we're going to up-link to the LM - just for your information - a state vector liftoff time P23 - P30 load and P99.
189:48:40|T|CMP|I hope that's not a lift-off time.
189:48:44|C|Har|Negative.
189:49:00|C|Har|The computer is yours.
189:49:03|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
189:49:07|C|Har|At 193:04 [192:52], we're gonna give you the LM jettison pad.
189:49:24|T|CMP|Okay. And where will that go? We're gonna go back to the other - the other part of the book?
189:49:32|C|Har|Roger. You'll copy that at - on Page 283. That's at 176:15 in the original Flight Plan.
189:49:22|T|CMP|(Laughter).
189:50:02|T|CMP|If you pull it out, I think, you'll probably find more behind it there. Okay, Hank.
189:50:14|C|Har|Okay. On the next page, we need to change all those times again. 215 becomes 193:10 [192:58].
189:50:42|T|CMP|Yeah. Let me see what time that was.
189:50:44|T|LMP|It's just 10 minutes.
189:50:46|T|CMP|Okay, we're - oh - let me - which battery?
189:51:02|T|CMP|Okay. We're charging battery A.
189:51:05|C|Har|Roger.
189:51:09|T|CMP|There.
189:51:50|T|CMP|Go ahead, Hank.
189:51:52|C|Har|Okay. At - at 193:10 [192:58], Verb 49 manouver to LM jett pad attitude.
189:52:24|C|Har|Delete the shape target load there in the MSFN up-link
189:52:41|T|CMP|Okay.
189:52:42|C|Har|Delete the target - the orbital science stuff there - delete the rest of the things in that column and at 193:23, begin suit donning.
189:53:20|T|CMP|Okay, And we're all waiting with bated breath to find out what time you <u>end</u> suit donning.
189:53:30|T|CMP|206:25 [206:13].
189:53:35|C|Har|I guess just when the end is end. I - Let's - let's look here at the next column; 193:40. Delete -
189:53:41|T|Crew|(Laughter) ... discouraging.
189:53:42|C|Har|Delete down through "Mapping Camera Laser Altimeter Cover, Close.
189:54:04|T|CMP|Okay. Are you - are you sure we wouldn't do better starting with a clean page like we did the other day once.
189:54:11|C|Har|I've been thinking the same thing.
189:54:13|T|CMP|I didn't mean to be facetious about that, Hank - because it seems like I'm doing more deleting than I'm writing, and it's getting so that - it's getting so confused, I may miss writing down - You know, when it comes time to execute, I may miss something.
189:54:39|C|Har|Well, if we had it to do over, I think this is what we ought to do. This thing was just handed to me a few minutes ago, and we're trying to straighten it out. You want to continue with this, or do you want to try to salvage -
189:54:50|T|CMP|Okay. Well, let's - yes, sir. Let's press on. Let's press on to this sequence until we get to LM jett, and see how it works.
189:55:00|C|Har|Okay. At - at 193:46 [193:34], and I guess you're just going to have to write this in the left-hand column and point over there because that's what I had to do. We want "Mass Spec, Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiment to Standby.
189:55:23|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Hank, let me - let me regroup now. I got everything deleted out of all that stuff that's on there down through "Mapping Camera Cover, Close." That leaves the alpha cover to be closed. Is that correct?
189:55:41|C|Har|That's correct.
189:55:59|T|CMP|Okay. Now read me the write-in.
189:56:02|C|Har|Roger. It's "Mass Spec, Ion Source, Off.
189:56:10|T|CMP|At what time?
189:56:11|C|Har|193:46 [193:34]. "Experiment to Standby." And then there's a little caution, wait 5 minutes before retracting Mass Spec boom. "Gamma Ray, Retract; X-Ray to Standby; and then at 193:51 [193:39], which is your five minutes, Mass Spec, Retract.
189:57:00|T|CMP|Okay. So I've deleted all that stuff that's there, except for the Alpha cover Close. At 193:46 [193:34], we'll take the Mass Spec Ion Source, Off, and Experiment to Standby. Start our five-minute time. The Gamma Ray boom gets retracted, the X-Ray goes to Standby, and after 5 minutes, I retract the mass spec boom, and the alpha-particle cover will come closed.
189:57:27|C|Har|That's affirmative. And then you'll do the - you'll do the purge line Heaters, On, configure for the dump, and the rest of the things there.
189:57:38|T|CMP|Okay.
189:57:40|C|Har|And on the next page, at 194:10 [193:58] -
189:57:40|C|Har|And on the next page, at 194:10 [193:58] -
189:57:45|T|CMP|Hey, Hank - Okay. This - This PGA donning, with things going on during it, bothers me a little bit. We - this PGA donning in our present configuration is - is a three-man effort, even if one man's job is to get in the corner and stay there - stay out of the way; and I'd like for us to do the minimum activity while we're putting those suits on.
189:58:26|T|CMP|If we can do it in the LM, I guess that will relieve a lot of the load here.
189:58:33|C|Har|Okay. I guess we're just gonna have to do the best we can, Ken, and we'll try to help as much as we can from down here.
189:58:43|T|CMP|Okay. It's not so much a problem entirely, it's just keeping track of things, and you just - once a guy starts putting that suit on, he commands the rest of the volume in the spacecraft. It's a - that A7LB is a real - real interesting operation.
189:58:25|T|CMP|If we can use the LM or it, that will help out a great deal. [According to the CM transcript "If we can do it in the LM, I guess that'll relieve a lot of the load here".]
189:59:06|C|Har|I don't see why not.
189:59:11|T|CMP|Okay. We'll plan to do that.
189:59:19|C|Har|Okay. At 194:10 [193:58], delete the P52 and -
189:59:23|C|Har|- the "P20; CMC Mode, Auto; GDC align.
189:59:30|C|Har|Do the purges and dumps, delete the P30 remark there -
189:59:40|C|Har|- and, at 194:23 [193:11], we're going to close the hatches.
189:59:43|T|CMP|Wait a minute. Did you say delete the dumps?
189:59:46|C|Har|Negative. Do the dumps.
189:59:50|T|CMP|Okay. Do the dumps and the purge, delete the P52, and the alignment and the P30 stuff.
190:00:01|C|Har|Roger. And, at 194 -
190:00:02|T|CMP|Okay, now. Let me write the times on this page.
190:00:29|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Go ahead.
190:00:31|C|Har|Okay. At 194:23 [194:11], we've closed the hatches, and you do the "Purge Line Heaters, Off," and terminate the waste water dump; and, at this point -
190:00:49|C|Har|- we're going to jump in the Flight Plan. I think that's as far as we ought to go on this rev. We're about two minutes from LOS -
190:00:55|T|CMP|Okay. You're starting to break up.
190:00:55|C|Har|- but, at this point, you're going to jump back to 176: 55.
190:01:03|C|Har|Okay. We'll -
190:01:06|T|CMP|If you'll tell me time bias to put on that page, I'll have that ready.
190:01:17|C|Har|We'll catch that the next rev, Ken.
190:01:21|T|CMP|Can you give me the time bias so we can - I can do that? Update the times on the page?
190:01:31|C|Har|We weren't planning on doing that section. We were just going to do all those steps. There's about 45 minutes of stuff in there getting ready for the jett before we do it.
190:01:44|T|CMP|Okay. How about the - if I'm standing by with a blank page and just let you read me a new time line.
190:01:54|C|Har|We'll have it ready for you, Ken.
190:01:59|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.

190:53:38|T|CMP|Go ahead.
190:53:42|C|Har|Hartsfield:</b> Hello, there.
190:53:51|C|Har|Would you like to finish the updates?
190:54:00|T|CMP|Okay. Just a minute.
190:54:25|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I'm ready to copy. I think I need the Updates Book.
190:54:31|C|Har|Okay. In the form of review, Ken, when we get to 192 hours, we're going to flip over to what was originally 214:00 in the Flight Plan, and that's going to become 192:10 [191:58]. There's a 10-minute pad in there. And, at 192:10 [191:58], we work through those changes down to the point where I read you "Start hatch closing" at 194:23 [194:11]. And, at 194:27 [194:15], we want to jump back to the "LM jett procedures," and there is only one change in that. So, I think that's the best place to go, which was at 176:50, originally.
190:55:29|T|CMP|Roger. You want to go at 194:27 [194:15] - is when you want to go the "LM jettison procedures?
190:55:38|C|Har|Roger. And, that's at 176:50 in the original Flight Plan, and 176:50 becomes 194:27 [194:15].
190:55:53|T|CMP|Okay; now stand by.
190:56:15|T|CMP|Okay; 176:50 becomes what, Hank?
190:56:18|C|Har|194:27 [194:15].
190:56:33|T|CMP|Okay; that means that all these things now are gonna be off by this screwy number. Is that correct?
190:56:41|C|Har|Roger. Until we get - That makes LM jett come out on time by going to this screwy number here, 194:27 [194:15]. And, we pick up there, and we don't -
190:56:51|T|CMP|And, that's the equivalent to 176:50?
190:56:55|C|Har|That's affirmative.
190:57:00|T|CMP|Okay; I have crossed out 176:50, and I've called it 194:27 [194:15].
190:57:06|C|Har|That is correct. Now we do not -
190:57:10|T|CMP|Okay.
190:57:11|C|Har|We delete the "VHF AM" and the "Configure the camera" business, and we pick up with the hatch closing. We already start with that. Now, you can start those things early. There is a - a little more time in here than was originally in the Flight Plan. And you don't have to do the -
190:57:28|T|CMP|Yeah. We're going to need a little more with those suit donnings.
190:57:32|C|Har|Okay; and the Direct O<sub>2</sub> Valve closed, you can delete that.
190:57:46|C|Har|Now, other than changing your time columns like, turning the page there, the 177 there becomes 194:37 [194:25]. Everything is good through the sep maneuver. The only change is that at 194:49 [194:37], the Noun 81, make -
190:58:06|T|CMP|Okay; wait a minute. Let me get the time column changed.
190:58:06|P|PAO|<b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> Apollo Control Houston [at] 191 hours, 10 minutes [190:58] Ground Elapsed Time, our Flight Director in the control center today is Phil Shaffer, relieving Gene Kranz on this shift.</p> 				<p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> Apollo Control Houston [at] 191 hours, 10 minutes [190:58] Ground Elapsed Time, our Flight Director in the control center today is Phil Shaffer, relieving Gene Kranz on this shift.
190:58:56|T|CMP|Okay. I got the time changed on the page. Now you can read me some times.
190:59:01|C|Har|Okay; 194:49, "The Noun 81 becomes minus 2.0 and 00." The CSM sep[aration] is at 2-foot-per-second retrograde. This is so we can get the CSM out in front of the LM for TEI.
190:59:29|T|CMP|Okay. Is the LM not going to impact before we do TEI?
190:59:38|C|Har|I think the planning is now for about 3 hours after TEI. What they need to do is wait for the 210 antenna to come up so they can get data -
190:59:47|T|CMP|We're not even going to get pictures of it, huh?
190:59:51|C|Har|That's affirmative; no pictures. Okay; at 195:18 [195:06] -
191:00:01|T|CMP|All right.
191:00:04|C|Har|- after "Roll (4), off," - that's the completion of the little block following the sep, you can insert a remark "Doff PGA's," and at this time, we jump back over to what was -
191:00:20|T|CMP|Wait a minute. I haven't found "Roll (4), off" yet.
191:00:22|C|Har|Okay, that's in the block after P00, after CSM sep 195:17 [195:05].
191:00:31|T|CMP|195:17 [195:05] - I have as the first number on the top of the page.
191:00:39|C|Har|That should be 195:07 [194:55].
191:00:45|T|CMP|Okay; I mislabeled it. Thank you. Let me redo them.
191:01:10|T|CMP|Okay; now, at 195:17 [195:05], say again?
191:01:13|C|Har|Okay; 195:18 [195:06], after the completion of that little block, - that ends with "Roll (4), off," enter a little comment, "Doff PGAs," and go to Page 327. That was originally 217 hours in the Flight Plan.
191:01:42|T|CMP|If I ever find my way through here.
191:01:56|T|CMP|Okay; I've got Page 327
191:02:01|C|Har|Are you there, now?
191:02:07|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Now, we want to do all these steps the that are down here at 195:20 or so, don't we? It says doff PGAs there, but we really want to do all these things do so in that group, right?
191:02:28|C|Har|Stand by.
191:03:04|T|CMP|I tried to dry them out.
191:03:10|T|CMP|There's a towel that's right over your left shoulder, if you need it. If your wrap round there.
191:03:43|T|CMP|Oh, isn't space flight glamorous.
191:04:03|T|CMP|Tuck them into there -
191:04:10|C|Har|Ken, I guess I meant for you to do everything there except doffing the biomed harness, and the - of course, delete the uplinks and the other stuff..
191:04:26|T|CMP|Okay. Then, we go to Page 327.
191:04:30|C|Har|That's affirmative.
191:04:31|T|CMP|Is that right?
191:04:32|C|Har|And 217 hours becomes 195:10 [194:58], and that's the time bias from then on, if you want to start updating your times. And, where we come back in there is at the place - place where were supposed to uplink the vector. Where we start there is 195:18 [195:06].
191:04:56|T|CMP|Okay. Now 217 is what?
191:05:01|C|Har|217 becomes 195:10 [194:58].
191:05:17|T|CMP|Okay. And then we follow the rest of the flight plan All the way out?
191:05:20|C|Har|Roger. We start at 195:18 [195:06], actually. We don't do those up-links. And, we pick up there at 195:18 and then from then on, we just follow sequentially - with all those little -
191:05:36|T|CMP|Why is it that there is no up-link in that?
191:05:45|C|Har|Well, I've been advised that there's another Flight Plan change coming that's going to move the subsat blocks back a little bit, and to get in some mapping camera stuff. Okay; I got it straight now. We will not track the subsat.
191:06:05|T|CMP|You will not track the subsatellite. Not even a little bit. Is that correct?
191:06:13|C|Har|That's affirmative. They're going to run the cameras to try to use the film.
191:06:35|T|CMP|All right, Hank. How about doing one thing for us, then? If this is going to be the basic time line, and we're going to use these pages, is it reasonable to get you to give us a clock sync somewhere - so we - I'm afraid if I keep scratch - scratching out times and all in here, I'm going to miss something important.
191:06:57|C|Har|Well, Ken, to fill you in on a little bit here, we originally planned a clock sync and that's why some of the confusion this morning. Then we found out that it wouldn't work, because it put the lift-off time prior to time of midnight and wasn't sure it would work, and we couldn't find out in time enough before we had to start giving you this up through the LM jett, so we're going to work on that possibility.
191:07:24|T|CMP|Well, okay. But for the time being, let's - let's just take one plan and run with it, and that is to update the times on every page.
191:07:32|C|Har|That's what we're doing.
191:07:34|T|CMP|Once we have - Yeah, okay. Okay. All right -
191:07:28|C|Har|You have your Nouns 93, Ken?
191:07:49|T|CMP|- you want to talk to the LM guys while I do some page updatings? Huh?
191:07:52|C|Har|Do you have your Noun 93s from the P52?
191:07:50|T|CMP|What do you need, Hank? Oh, you want our - Well, let me find it. I don't know what page that's on now.
191:08:21|T|CMP|You out them up there, how's the Delta-P?
191:08:32|T|CMP|Okay.
191:08:52|T|CMP|Here we go, Hank. There was minus 0.1, plus 0.002, plus 0.095. That was torqued at 190:21:00 [190:09:10].
191:09:05|C|Har|Roger; copy. And, we need barber pole, plus 4.
191:09:20|T|CMP|Yes, sir. Yes.
191:09:26|C|Har|And, Ken, the last thing, if you can give us A/C Roll, and we're - then we'll be ready for the LM updates.
191:09:38|T|CMP|Okay. A/C Roll.
191:10:17|C|Har|16, Fredo's going to read up the LM changes if you give us the word whenever you're ready to copy.
191:10:26|T|CMP|Okay, stand by. You ready to copy the - the - Yeah -
191:13:35|T|CMP|Hank, I'm a little confused, it looks like in places we've got a 12-minute difference, and in other places we've got a 10-minute difference from the times that are marked on here. Is that correct? Did I interpret that properly?
191:13:49|C|Har|Yeah, that's affirmative. We go back to the - to the LM jett procedures. There's just - you know, we fitted in to fit with the actual jett time, so that time difference is correct.
191:14:06|T|CMP|Okay. Does that mean things like AOS and all that will move the same amount, or is that different?
191:14:14|C|Har|We plan to give you updates on those as we go along.
191:14:21|T|CMP|Okay.
191:14:54|C|Har|16, Houston.
191:15:00|T|CMP|Go ahead. Go ahead, Fredo.
191:15:03|C|Hai|Okay; we got quite a batch to give you here out of the Contingency Book in the time line. And I guess you'll have to drag out a different color writing utensil than you used yesterday, because you're going to be writing over some things you already did on the Time Line Book.
191:15:24|T|CMP|Well, right now, Fredo, we'll - we'll have to stand by for a minute.
191:15:29|C|Hai|Okay.
191:15:50|T|CMP|We've got all colors, especially black, Fredo.
191:16:00|C|Hai|That's nice.
191:16:20|T|LMP|Okay, Fred.
191:16:24|C|Hai|Okay. Is this Charlie?
191:16:39|T|LMP|How's that, Fred? How are you reading now?
191:16:42|C|Hai|Okay; loud and clear, Charlie. And, where you need to be is on page 2-1, phase 1, of the Module Activation.
191:16:55|T|LMP|That's where I am.
191:16:58|C|Hai|Okay. Right at the top there, when you IVT to the LM, there's a note that says "Use the CSM comm umbilical." As bad as that LM's comm has been, we're not really going to be in good shape there until almost before LOS, when we get to steerable attitude. Okay; and otherwise there -
191:17:20|T|LMP|Okay; what do you mean?
191:17:22|C|Hai|Okay; in Step 1, you can scratch the second line, and write in "Carry CSM O<sub>2</sub> hose across.
191:17:39|T|LMP|Okay.
191:17:40|C|Hai|Okay at the end of Step 2 - And incidentally, we need the hose because we're not going to bring on the suit fans - At the end of Step 2 there, put a note in that says to give us the CB configuration on 11 and 16. And I guess all we really need is the ones closed, because there shouldn't be too many that are closed.
191:18:13|T|LMP|Okay.
191:17:40|C|Hai|Okay; Item 3, first line, make that "Ascent H<sub>2</sub>O," and the second line, make it the -
191:18:26|T|LMP|Okay. That's reasonable.
191:18:28|C|Hai|Yes. And likewise, second line is number 1 Ascent O<sub>2</sub>.
191:18:36|T|LMP|Okay.
191:18:37|C|Hai|Okay; you can scratch the "Cabin Repress to Auto," the next line, and substitute "Press Regs A and B to Egress," and that is indicated as being a verify.
191:18:55|T|LMP|Okay.
191:18:57|C|Hai|We'd like to retain the next line there, that "Cabin Repress breakers," so you've got the caution and warnings.
191:19:07|T|LMP|Go ahead.
191:19:09|C|Hai|Okay. Another little block you might write out to the left there, label it "Transfer Items." And, maybe you've already done some of these, but this will take care of some of the ones we missed having you do yesterday. And they're the PTK(?), the Flight Kit, the purse with the unused food, and the used fecal-urine bags, and lastly the DSEA.
191:19:57|T|LMP|Okay.
191:19:59|C|Hai|Okay; beside the subheading near "Power transfer" write in 192:15.
191:20:10|T|LMP|Okay.
191:20:12|C|Hai|Okay, now that whole block that says "If no CSM power", we're going to use to effect the transfer except we're kind of changing it around, so you can just scratch that "If no CSM power." Go down -
191:20:28|T|LMP|Okay.
191:20:30|C|Hai|- go down to the fourth line and change the "Ascent ECA Control, Close" to "Ascent ECA, Close.
191:20:45|T|LMP|Okay.
191:20:45|||<p class="tech"><b>191 20 h6 Haise:</b> After that, add a step that is "Cross Tie Bus and Balance Loads, Open.
191:21:03|T|LMP|Okay.
191:21:04|C|Hai|Now, that's gonna temporarily wipe out the LMP bus, but don't worry about it. The next step is "Bat 5 Normal Feed, On," so we'll get it back there. Okay -
191:21:14|T|LMP|Okay.
191:21:16|C|Hai|- after the "Bat 5 step," add in, and you'll have to write it out to the left there, I guess, "CSM LM Power, Off," followed by "Bat 6 Normal Feed, On, talkback gray.
191:21:39|T|LMP|Okay.
191:21:41|C|Hai|Okay. Out beside "CB (11) and (16) EPS," scratch the first line there. That's "Descent ECA Control, two, Close.
191:21:52|T|LMP|Okay.
191:21:55|C|Hai|Okay, and then starting two lines down: where it's "Bat 1 Low Voltage, On," et cetera, just scratch the whole rest of those lines in that box.
191:22:07|T|LMP|Okay.
191:22:10|C|Hai|Okay, below that, Step 1, "Transfer to LM power," you can scratch all of those lines, all five.
191:22:19|T|LMP|Okay.
191:22:21|C|Hai|Step 2, "Flood Light to All," but then scratch the next three lines.
191:22:31|T|LMP|Okay.
191:22:34|C|Hai|Okay. Page 2-2, under step 1 you can scratch everything in parentheses.
191:22:44|T|LMP|Okay.
191:22:46|C|Hai|Under Step 2, Line 2, scratch "Descent ECA Control, Close.
191:22:57|T|LMP|Okay.
191:22:58|C|Hai|Then all four items that are under "CB(16) Stab/Control," from there on, these four lines, scratch.
191:23:10|T|LMP|Okay.
191:23:13|C|Hai|Okay. Now, the next Step 3 items, plus the block there about "When bus volts less than 27, high voltage taps," scratch all that clear on down on down to "ECS activation.
191:23:27|T|LMP|Okay.
191:23:29|C|Hai|ECS activation," Step 1, third line, CB (11) you can scratch - Stand by one.
191:24:00|C|Hai|Okay, Charlie. That's correct. "CB (11) ECS Suit Fan 1, close," scratch that line.
191:24:08|T|LMP|I got it scratched.
191:24:10|C|Hai|Okay; and the circuit breaker below that, "Glycol Pump, two, Close," change the two to a one.
191:24:20|T|LMP|Okay.
191:24:22|C|Hai|Okay; then the next two lines at the bottom there, "Press Reg A and B," "Suit Gas Diverters," scratch those.
191:24:32|T|LMP|Okay.
191:24:33|C|Hai|Add a line below that, "Glycol to Pump 1.
191:24:41|T|LMP|Okay.
191:24:43|C|Hai|Okay, ready for 2-3, and Step 2, you can scratch the first line about "If LM is to be active", et cetera. And, just the Prime Evap "Flow 1, Open." That's Step 2, now.

191:26:09|T|LMP|Okay.
191:26:11|C|Hai|Okay; the second line there, rather than "Off/RESET," make it "Range.

191:35:37|T|LMP|Okay.
191:35:38|C|Hai|And before you turn the page - before you turn the page there, we need to write in down at the bottom of that page, "Updata Link to Data.
191:35:54|T|LMP|Okay.
191:35:55|C|Hai|Followed by a "MSFN Up-link," and if you're interested in what that is, it's a state vector on LGC time. A P30 and a P99 load.
191:36:14|T|LMP|Okay.
191:36:15|C|Hai|Okay; after we get done with the up-links, put CSM maneuver to jett attitude and select Forward Omni.

191:36:38|C|Hai|Go ahead.
191:36:39|T|LMP|Wait a minute, Fredo. We maneuver to jett attitude and select Forward Omni?
191:36:44|C|Hai|That's affirmative, Charlie.
191:36:48|T|LMP|Okay.
191:23:36|C|49|We just went to the steerable attitude, so we can get all these up-links in.
191:36:59|C|Hai|Okay; then we - next note is "Verify jett attitude, CSM Narrow Dead Band, Att Hold.
191:37:10|T|LMP|Okay.
191:37:12|C|Hai|Then it's "Window Shades, three, Closed." That's to keep the heat leak down for that 8 hour loiter time the LM has to do.
191:37:28|T|LMP|Okay.
191:37:29|C|Hai|Then we'll go the LM Timeline Book, Page 14, right hand column.
191:37:28|T|LMP|Stand by.
191:37:42|C|Hai|Hey, you ought to write that note there, Charlie, so -
191:37:55|T|LMP|Yeah, I got it.
191:37:56|C|Hai|Okay. The whole left column there is just scratched, and I guess they need to know what kind of shape you're in over on the right side. I understand you scratched through a bunch of this already.
191:38:12|T|LMP|Yeah, but I think I know what to do. Just target the PGNS and get a Go for closeout, looks like it's all I got to do.
191:38:23|C|Hai|Yeah. Okay. If you're ready, then at Step 1 there, delete -
191:38:31|T|LMP|Go ahead.
191:38:37|C|Hai|Stand by one, Charlie. Ken, is about 30 seconds to start bringing up the SIM bay configuration.
191:38:50|T|CMP|Well, if the hats can do that for us; okay. I'll sure get it on there as fast as I can and I'd like to have some clarification. I just turned off the two hydrogen fans - their heaters, and I had nothing in the way of fans on Tank 3.
191:39:10|T|LMP|Watch it, John. Don't let that big hatch ...
191:39:13|C|Hai|Okay; I'll continue on here while they're thinking about that, Ken. Charlie, Step 2 there, scratch the "V47 Enter," et cetera, and substitute with the Verb 77 Enter.
191:39:35|T|LMP|Okay.
191:39:36|C|Hai|Scratch Step 5.

191:43:21|C|Hai|Okay; and I guess you've - you've got the idea here, Charlie, that everything else that's indicated on this, you're going to have to configure. Like a bunch of these you're going to be closing.
191:43:34|T|LMP|Yeah, I know.

191:43:54|T|LMP|Yeah. Guess so.
191:43:56|C|Hai|Okay; Step 2. I guess the way you want to suit, with that "Transfer to CSM" step, fifth line there under Step 2, you can scratch and write it as "Don suits and then transfer.
191:44:16|T|LMP|Okay.
191:44:18|C|Hai|Okay; then everything "LM to CSM transfer list," the rest of that column on the left side, and the whole right side, we can scratch. If you wanted to, I guess you -
191:44:30|T|LMP|Okay.
191:44:31|C|Hai|- You could use it for one final verification there, Charlie, but we should have picked all those items.
191:44:39|T|LMP|Okay.
191:44:21|C|Hai|And that's it.
191:44:42|T|LMP|I got one question, Fred. Have - On the PPKs, I took a peek at them yesterday, and there was only one bag in there, and it says three here. Are we only supposed to have one bag?
191:44:56|C|Hai|I'll check that, Charlie. Stand by.
191:45:07|C|Hai|Okay; the word I get, Charlie, is there is only one PPK pack.
191:45:15|T|LMP|Yeah, I thought so, but I just wanted to make sure.
191:45:20|C|Hai|Must have been a small cannon ball.
191:45:25|T|LMP|Yeah. (Laughter) Okay; look, I'm going on over to the LM and get started on this stuff. Okay?
191:45:36|C|Hai|Okay. That sounds excellent, and I guess we need to talk to Ken now.
191:45:44|T|LMP|Okay.
191:45:59|T|LMP|Hey, Ken, could you turn off my Vox, please? Okay, open hatch.
191:46:21|C|Har|Ken, I don't know where you are on the procedures now, but it's about time to start that maneuver, if you get a chance.
191:40:32|T|CMP|All right, Henry. I'll be there in just a minute. I just finished your SIM Bay stuff. And, Henry, could you have an EECOM check and see if our sensor and accumulator looks like it's been working properly in the last hour?
191:47:04|C|Har|Okay; will do. Okay, EECOM says that they can see it's receiving the stroke signal, but they have no way of telling if it really does stroke.
191:47:25|T|CMP|Okay. Seems like it has gotten a little stuffy and the humidity has built up a little bit, and I was just wondering is there some way I could verify that it is working without having to watch this high O<sub>2</sub> Flow on - watch the O<sub>2</sub> Flow sensor. Can they - they have the Flow sensor; can they tell if it - if it's been getting its flow pulse?
191:47:25|P|PAO|<b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control Houston 192 hours [191:48] Ground Elapsed Time.

191:48:14|T|CMP|Okay; I'm in Auto 2 now. And I'm changing the DAP to Narrow Dead Band.

191:48:46|T|LMP|Okay; the CBs are in - as per page 3-13 and 3-14, staged deactivation, that we left them last night at Moon. [?].
191:49:00|C|Har|Roger; copy.
191:49:04|T|LMP|No. I thought I had my own.
191:49:58|C|Har|Ken, it only took your Mapping Camera 2 minutes and 28 seconds to retract, that time.
191:50:08|T|CMP|Yeah, we noticed that.
191:50:36|C|Har|Ken, while you are maneuvering there I'd like to get a quick check on the cryo configurations.
191:50:43|T|CMP|Okay.
191:50:45|C|Har|What we'd like to have is O<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Off, 3, Auto.
191:50:56|T|CMP|O<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2 are Off, and 3 is in Auto.
191:50:59|C|Har|And Hydrogen Tank Heaters 1 and 2 in Auto. And all three fans, Off.
191:51:11|T|CMP|Okay; Hydrogen Tank Heaters 1 and 2 in Auto, and all three fans, are Off. Thank you.
191:51:17|C|Har|Okay, and we should be on the 100-watt heaters.
191:51:23|T|CMP|Yeah, that's what, we've been running on - I don't -
191:51:48|C|Har|Ken, the LiOH canister you had trouble with, has it already been put in the LM for good?
191:51:57|T|CMP|No, sir. I've got it stowed on board.
191:51:59|C|Har|Okay, real good. We'd like to bring that thing home.
191:52:00|T|CMP|It was the one I took out last night; Okay; I had a little trouble with the one yesterday morning, but not so much, and it's already in the LM. Last night I was getting concerned that we picked up some humidity and it was swelling.
191:52:17|C|Har|Roger.
191:52:29|C|Har|Okay. Ken, what we'd like to do, is get Canister 13 to the LM in place of the one we're bringing home.
191:52:43|T|CMP|Say again, Henry.
191:52:45|C|Har|I said did you make a substitute for the one that you're going to keep there or -
191:52:55|T|CMP|I'm sorry, I still haven't understood you. Say again, one more time, please.
191:53:01|C|Har|Okay; we're going to keep the canister that's bad. We're going to bring it home so we can look at it, so did you substitute another one to be jettisoned with the LM?
191:53:13|T|CMP|No, sir. I packed all that stuff yesterday sometime, and it's over in the LM in a jett bag, and if we have extra canisters, I'd just as soon leave it that way if we could.
191:53:24|C|Har|We concur.
191:53:28|T|CMP|We're having enough trouble staying up the time line, without digging through a jett bag looking for a canister.
191:53:31|C|Har|We don't want to do that.
191:53:37|T|CMP|Easy on that baby ... Okay, Hank. You got the one that stuck last night. It's down in - in A - A-3, I believe it is the first one. And let's leave it at that.
191:53:53|C|Har|We concur.
191:54:39|T|CMP|Okay; and Orion's back on internal power at 192:06.
191:54:46|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
191:56:37|T|CMP|Man, Henry, we're not going to be in attitude until 192:14. Is that acceptable?
191:56:44|C|Har|That's okay.
191:58:14|C|Har|16, Houston. We have a block data we need to get up before LOS. Okay, 16, we're about 2 minutes from LOS. I don't think we can get it in now. We'll give it to you next rev. AOS will be at 194 - 193 - 192:58 [192:46].

192:47:53|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston.
192:47:59|T|CMP|Go ahead, Henry.
192:48:01|C|Har|Roger. How is it going?
192:48:06|T|CMP|Well, we're waiting for some LM - stuff, I guess.
192:48:11|C|Har|Okay. Pads and everything are in the work. Maybe we could clean up a few things now. We need the Noun 20s on page 212 in the Contingency Checklist. That's from the LM.
192:48:31|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Here we go with the 212. The Noun 20s were for the Command Module: 33294, 11631, 30499. In the LM, 34091, 29673, 05443. Over.
192:48:56|C|Har|Roger. Copy and the GET?
192:49:04|T|CMP|Okay. At 192:36:40 [192:24:50].
192:49:09|C|Har|Roger, copy.
192:49:29|T|LMP|Okay, Hank. We're ready for the up-links. We're sitting in Hi bit rate, we've got Data and good signal strength. You should be able to sock it to us.
192:49:43|C|Har|Roger, Charlie. And they are not quite ready with those up-links.
192:00:49|T|LMP|Okay. Hank, let me ask a question. Over.
192:50:04|C|Har|Go ahead.
192:50:08|T|LMP|Okay. Did it occur to anybody down there that last night if we'd stayed powered up, we could have gotten rid of this contraption, and it wouldn't have taken up all this time today? Or was that ever discussed?
192:50:23|C|Har|It was discussed, and the decision was made to power down.
192:50:30|T|LMP|Yeah. Well. we're gonna be about four times the work to do whatever it is they would have done. And I'm not really 100 percent sure we're going to be right on this, because we never practiced it.
192:50:45|C|Har|Roger. Understand. And we'd like to get the S-Band Voice Function switch Off in Orion.
192:50:59|T|LMP|It's Off. And the comm configuration you read up was the Down Voice Backup.
192:51:10|C|Har|Roger. We want to get a little ranging, and we'd like to verify who was on biomed last night.
192:51:22|T|CDR|I guess all of us were, weren't we? I think we all were, Hank.
192:51:28|C|Har|Okay. Understand all three.
192:51:36|T|LMP|Can't you tell?
192:51:47|C|Har|I guess for some reason, they didn't copy the CDR.
192:51:56|T|CDR|Well, it was plugged in.
192:52:02|T|CMP|Hank, we've got a - the vacuum cleaner stalled out sometime on us, and if you guys want it back for failure analysis, we'll bring it back. Otherwise, we're gonna toss it out. Do you have any thoughts on that?
192:52:18|C|Har|We'll check into it, Ken. And would you by chance have a crew status report?
192:52:34|T|CMP|No, Henry. I haven't gotten around to doing that kind of bookwork yet. Can we just sort of let it go for a while?
192:52:40|C|Har|Affirmative.
192:52:43|T|CMP|We're all here.
192:52:44|C|Har|Okay. I have a TEI-63 pad I'd like to get up, block data.
192:53:13|T|CMP|All righty. Go right ahead.
192:53:17|C|Har|Okay. TEI-63, SPS/G&N; 38491; plus 0.67, plus 0.97; 198:33:20.08; plus 3186.7, plus 0731.6, minus 0118.9; 181, 083, 015; the rest is NA; ullage, 2 jets, 17 seconds; ascent REFSMMAT, assumes sep maneuver.
192:54:33|T|CMP|Okay. TEI-63, SPS/G&N; 38491; plus 0.67, plus 0.97; 198:33:20.08; plus 3186.7, plus 0731.6; minus 0118.9; 181, 083, 015; two jets for 17 seconds on the ascent REFSMMAT and that's assuming sep maneuver.
192:54:55|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
192:55:10|T|CMP|I have a Hi O<sub>2</sub> Flow and I can't figure out why. No, it's been just been sitting there.
192:55:20|T|CDR|...
192:55:22|T|CMP|At four. I turned it off a long time ago, John.
192:55:37|T|CMP|Well, if - if that's the only problem, you're right; but - but high O<sub>2</sub> flows are caused by things not - not - I don't care about the end result.
192:55:53|T|CDR|Why don't you change the ...?
192:55:55|T|CMP|I've already done that. Our cabin has dropped to - I guess that's the prob - that's why the flow is up.
192:56:08|T|CDR|...
192:56:12|T|CMP|Maybe last night, which I think you got something this morning.
192:56:15|T|CDR|...
192:56:18|T|CMP|That ought to - that ought to tighten it up. Self-sealing tanks.
192:56:44|C|Har|Ken, if you - wanted to get your Flight Plan in order, if you took Pages 283 through 286 and just stuck them between 326 and 327, they should all be in order.
192:57:01|T|CMP|Okay.
192:57:16|T|CMP|Take 283.
192:58:02|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. That's Page 283 through 285 and -
192:58:09|C|Har|Roger. And just insert those between 326 and 327, and then - then you'll be in order just to flip the pages.
192:58:20|T|CMP|That's a good plan; wish I'd thought of that.
192:58:37|C|Har|And, Charlie, I have your fine align torquing angles for Page 214.
192:58:47|T|LMP|Would you stand by just for a second, please? Okay, Hank.
192:58:56|C|Har|Roger. Plus 02620, plus 07950, plus 04770.
192:59:37|T|LMP|Is that a good readback, Hank?
192:59:39|C|Har|I didn't read you, Charlie.
192:59:45|T|LMP|Okay. I read back plus 02620, plus 07950, plus 04770. Over.
192:59:56|C|Har|Roger. Good readback. And we'd like to get another set of Noun 20s after you torque those.
193:00:13|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Our book is rearranged per your suggestion. That should help a great deal.
193:00:20|C|Har|Roger.
193:00:24|T|CMP|And can you give me a jettison pad, yet?
193:00:29|C|Har|They're working on the pads, Ken. Looks about like 10 more minutes.
193:00:40|T|CMP|Okay. I just noticed I'm supposed to be there already.
193:01:12|C|Har|And, Ken, the decision is to bring the vacuum cleaner home with you.
193:01:21|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I'll bring the vacuum cleaner home.
193:01:33|C|Har|And, Charlie, when you get to Noun 20, just hold them -
193:01:35|T|LMP|Okay, Hank. Here's the Noun -
193:01:36|C|Har|- and we'll copy.
193:01:40|T|LMP|Okay. I was just going to read them to you. We got them.
193:02:36|C|Har|Charlie, we have the Noun 20s.
193:02:43|T|LMP|Okay.
193:03:12|T|CMP|Hank, I'd also like to verify that it's okay to leave the CSM-to-LM umbilicals hooked up in the tunnel.
193:03:21|C|Har|Okay. I'll check that out.
193:03:36|C|Har|And, Ken, to give you a few more words on that - cancelling that subsat tracking. We're trading that off for photography - Mapping Camera, Pan Camera, and X-ray. And we're getting 16 degrees more of the lunar surface that's never been photographed before.
193:03:52|T|CMP|Okay.
193:04:02|C|Har|And, Ken, it's okay to leave the umbilicals hooked up.
193:04:07|T|CMP|All right. Thank you.
193:05:50|C|Har|16, Houston.
193:06:10|T|CMP|Go right ahead, Henry.
193:06:13|C|Har|Roger. We'd like to verify once again the docking angle.
193:06:23|T|CMP|Okay. We'll read it one more time. Turn to your right. Your right. There it is.
193:06:40|T|CDR|Plus 4.5 degrees!
193:06:44|C|Har|Roger. Copy. Plus 4.5.
193:07:15|C|Har|What the problem is there, John, is we're still getting a torquing angle required, and we're having a little trouble with it. And we're just trying to figure out what's wrong.
193:07:31|T|CDR|Right. You want to check our arithmetic? That's probably a possible problem.
193:07:44|C|Har|Roger. We did another Noun 20, so we got a problem with the X - X-axis.
193:12:01|C|Har|16, Houston. Charlie, I got a new set of torquing angles for you.
193:12:12|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by a second.
193:12:26|T|LMP|Go ahead, Hank.
193:12:29|C|Har|Okay. Minus 02900, minus 08320, minus 02930. And we'd - after you've torqued that, would you get us another set of Noun 20s on the DSKY?
193:12:50|T|LMP|Okay. I copy minus 02900, minus 0820 - minus 08320, minus 04930.
193:13:02|C|Har|Good readback, Charlie.

193:15:07|C|Har|Roger. We're copying them.
193:17:29|C|Har|Orion, verify Data A. We're ready with the up-link.

193:19:30|T|CMP|Oh, very well.
193:19:32|C|Har|We need to keep the LM comm up is the reason.
193:19:38|T|CMP|Roger. I understand.
193:19:43|C|Har|And if you'd flip the page again, I'll give you your subsat jett PAD.
193:19:54|T|CMP|Okay.
193:19:55|C|Har|196:13:46 [196:02:56]; 089, 246, 000.
193:20:09|T|CMP|Okay. 196:13:46 [196:02:56]; 089, 246, and all zeros.
193:20:16|C|Har|Good readback, Ken.
193:20:22|T|CMP|Okay. Can you give me some of these photo pads so I can get them going, because this time after jettison is going to be pretty crowded, too?
193:20:30|C|Har|They're in work.
193:20:31|T|CMP|I'd like to get those down right now, before we get all suited up and ready to go.
193:20:35|C|Har|That's a good plan. I'll try to have them for you in a couple of minutes. And, for Orion, I have the LM deorbit PAD.
193:20:56|T|CMP|Okay, he'll be with you in just a second, Hank. He's halfway in a suitwork.
193:21:01|C|Har|Roger.
193:21:12|T|LMP|Okay. Speak to us, Henry, with the pads.
193:21:16|C|Har|Roger. LM deorbit, 203:08:09.50 [202:56:19.50]; minus 0238.9, minus 0103.1, plus 0254.5; NA down to FDAI inertial, 197, 023; the rest is NA; LM weight, 5275.
193:21:52|T|LMP|Hank, Hank, stand by. Stand - Hey, stand by. I ran out of ink. Stand by.
193:22:00|C|Har|(Laughter) Roger.
193:22:04|T|CDR|What'd you do with the pencil I gave you? It doesn't run out.
193:22:11|T|LMP|(Laughter) Okay. Go ahead. Start with - I got the Delta-Vs, but everything after that I missed.
193:22:15|T|CDR|(Laughter) That ought to tell them something about the changes.
193:22:18|C|Har|Okay. FDAI is 197, 023. The rest is NA; LM weight, 5275.

193:23:00|C|Har|Roger. And on the Noun 33, the seconds is 09.50.
193:23:07|T|LMP|Okay, 09.50. Is that running out of ink tell you something about the changes we've had, Ken, I mean, Hank.
193:23:19|C|Har|Roger. It does.
193:23:41|T|CDR|Yeah, but don't get behind the power curve because this cooling loop down here ain't got much.
193:23:50|T|CMP|Okay.
193:23:53|C|Har|Ken, which PAD is it that you want? Those on page 324 don't - don't apply.
193:24:06|T|CMP|Okay. You mentioned something about we're gonna get a whole lot of Mapping and Pan Camera stuff in there in those revs between there and TEI. And I just thought that, if we had some idea of what's coming, we could do a better job of getting ready for it.
193:24:28|C|Har|Roger. This all occurs on the rev after next.
193:24:34|T|CMP|I know. I'd - I'd like to be able to plan a little further ahead. If you don't get ahead - plan ahead, you just run a real good chance of not getting all the things done the way you'd like to.
193:24:45|C|Har|We agree. And I'll try to have some words for you here in a few minutes.
193:24:51|T|CMP|Okay. I understand your problems. That's - that's no sweat.
193:25:42|C|Har|And, 16, for your information, LOS is at 194:11.
193:25:54|T|CMP|Okay.
193:27:53|C|Har|Orion, all your loads are in.
193:28:01|T|LMP|Okay. Can we start to maneuver to the jett attitude?
193:28:06|C|Har|Stand by.
193:30:10|C|Har|Casper, Houston. We'd - we'd like for you to start on the callouts that are at 193:46 [193:34].
193:30:21|T|CMP|Okay. I'll do those now.
193:30:24|C|Har|Roger. We want look at data on telemetry before we start to maneuver because, when we do that, we go into Low Bit Rate and an Omni.
193:30:34|T|CMP|Okay.
193:30:49|T|CMP|Okay, the Mass Spec Ion Source is Off. The Experiment is Standby. Gamma Ray goes to Retract.
193:30:56|T|CMP|Mark. Barber pole; X-Ray to Standby.
193:31:48|T|CMP|Okay, the Alpha and X-ray covers are coming closed.
193:31:53|T|CMP|Mark.
193:31:55|C|Har|Roger.
193:31:56|T|CMP|They're closed.
193:32:40|C|Har|Orion, Houston.
193:32:47|T|CMP|I haven't got time right now, Charlie. He's calling you.
193:32:52|T|LMP|Go ahead.
193:32:57|C|Har|Okay, Charlie. in that setup, we forgot to get things configured for auto transfer protection on the glycol system there. So I've got a short read-out here to make sure that's configured.
193:33:13|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
193:33:15|C|Har|Okay. On Panel 11, and I think you're already there - you checked, you got Pump 1, Pump 2, and the Auto Transfer breakers closed.
193:33:30|T|LMP|That's affirm. It's set up.
193:33:33|C|Har|Okay. Switch to Pump 2.
193:33:45|T|LMP|Okay. Pump 2.
193:33:46|C|Har|Okay. Open the Auto Transfer circuit breaker and then switch back to Pump 1.
193:34:01|T|LMP|You're back to Pump 1.
193:34:03|C|Har|Okay. And, lastly, Charlie, close the Auto Transfer breaker, and we're back in business.
193:34:11|T|LMP|Okay.
193:35:39|C|Har|Casper, we're ready for Mass Spec, Retract.
193:36:14|T|CMP|Okay. The mass spec is coming now.
193:36:18|C|Har|Roger.
193:37:20|C|Har|Orion, Houston. Did you load your DAP before you started the P30?
193:37:51|C|Har|We need Auto on the High Gain, Casper.
193:38:55|C|Har|And, Ken, our plan for the - for the camera work is, at about 196:45 [196:33], somewhere in there, it's sunrise. We plan to run the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter throughout the - the daylight part of that Rev, up to about 197:50 [197:38]. And we'll bring the Pan Camera on at about - oh, a third of the way through that daylight portion, about 197:15 [197:03], and run it until darkness. And we'll do a Solar Corona just prior to that, and maybe some handheld photography, which we'll read up to you after you doff your suits on the next rev.
193:40:30|T|CMP|Houston, Orion.
193:40:35|C|Har|Go ahead.
193:41:04|C|Har|Ken, it looks like the Mass Spec is jammed. Would you give a 15-second Deploy -
193:41:07|T|CMP|Houston, Orion.
193:41:08|C|Har|- and then a Retract?
193:41:16|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 16.
193:41:19|C|Har|Go ahead. Apollo 16, Houston. Go ahead.
193:41:40|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. Go ahead.
193:41:52|T|CMP|Houston, Apollo 16. Over.
193:41:55|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston.
193:42:18|T|Comms Technician|Madrid comm tech, Houston comm tech, Net 1 voice check.
193:42:20|T|CMP|Hey, Hank, you read us? 16?
193:42:22|C|Har|Roger, 16. Houston's reading you.
193:42:25|T|Comms Technician|Got a voice? Houston Comm Tech, Net 1.
193:42:27|T|Comms Technician|Got a voice?
193:42:28|T|Comms Technician|Okay. We seem to be out with Madrid.
193:42:31|T|Comms Technician|Roger; stand by.
193:42:45|T|Comms Technician|Casper, this is -
193:43:01|T|CMP|Okay. We'll just stand by until they get through with it. Thank you very much, sir.
193:43:06|T|Comms Technician|You're welcome. I enjoyed it.
193:43:07|T|CMP|How's everything in Madrid?
193:43:09|T|Comms Technician|Everything's fine here.
193:43:15|T|CMP|Good.
193:43:16|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston.
193:43:21|T|CMP|Hello, Henry. Glad to have you back.
193:43:23|C|Har|Roger. We had a little trouble with the network there. It appears that the Mass Spec boom is jammed, and we'd like for you to give it a 15-second Deploy and then back to Retract.
193:43:38|T|CMP|Okay. 15-second Deploy and back to Retract. Stand by.
193:43:43|T|CMP|Deploy.
193:43:50|T|CMP|How far did it look like it went before it jammed?
193:43:55|C|Har|About a third of the way in.
193:44:01|T|CMP|Okay. There's 15 seconds, and I'm going to Retract.
193:44:28|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Charlie has a visual on it, and it stopped again.
193:44:34|C|Har|Our data confirms that, Ken.
193:44:39|T|CMP|Okay.
193:44:57|T|CMP|I've got the switch in the Off position now.
193:45:03|C|Har|Roger. Ken, would you give us one more of those 15-second Deploy and back to Retract?
193:45:15|T|CMP|Okay. How about if I just take it all the way out?
193:45:32|C|Har|Okay. Why don't you go ahead and try it? We have data shows it's stalling both ways.
193:45:42|T|CMP|It's going out now.
193:46:32|C|Har|Orion, we'd like you to verify Forward Omni before you secure the LM.
193:46:47|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. It - it didn't go all the way out and Charlie can visually verify that it is not all the way out.
193:46:56|C|Har|Okay. Would you try another Retract?
193:47:02|T|CMP|It's going to Retract now.
193:48:43|T|CMP|Houston, can we start the new maneuver to the jett attitude? Over.
193:48:49|C|Har|Stand by 16.
193:49:25|C|Har|16, Houston. Give us the SIM bay roll-jet configuration and start your Verb 49. I think that's what you've got in there now.
193:49:38|T|CMP|Yes, sir. It is.
193:49:44|C|Har|And you are No Go for coupled jets. I think we're going to have to jettison that boom. We're look at that now.
193:49:56|T|CMP|O Okay. Is that a requirement for - the LM jettison, you mean?
193:50:10|C|Har|We'll get you an answer to that.
193:50:32|C|Har|Okay. We're gonna keep the boom for LM jett, but keep the SIM bay jet configuration, so we don't go coupled.
193:50:46|T|CMP|Okay. If we stay in the SIM bay jet configuration, what's this gonna do to our translation capability for the maneuver? We gonna have to line it all up in one axis?
193:51:32|C|Har|Roger, Ken. Minus X is what we want to do on that sep maneuver, anyhow.
193:51:39|T|CMP|Roger. But that's probably not going to line up with the - with the attitude I'm unlocking in, is it? Normally that turns out to be a three-axis burn.
193:51:54|C|Har|Maneuver to get it all in minus-X, and then do it.
193:52:05|T|CMP|Okay. So you want me to maneuver to the minus-X attitude first.
193:52:12|C|Har|Roger. We want to get the sep maneuver all in X, and I've got FDO trying to get you an attitude for that.
193:52:20|T|CMP|Well, I can probably figure that out from Noun 41, I mean, P41.
193:54:30|C|Har|Casper, FDO says the maneuver attitude to get that minus-X thruster is pitch, 327; yaw, 0; and roll, whatever you have.
193:54:52|T|CMP|Okay. That'll be whatever roll we have, pitch of 327, and a yaw of 0.
193:54:58|C|Har|Roger. And we'd like to remind you we will need Omni Delta for AOS next time and to change the "verify" to a "configure the DSE after LOS to Low Bit Rate; Record; Forward.
193:55:15|T|CMP|Roger.
193:55:59|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. You're looking good at LOS, and AOS will be at 194:57 [194:45].
193:56:10|T|CMP|Roger. And we're feeling good, too.
193:57:11|C|Har|And, Ken, to reiterate: as far as that boom is concerned, it's the roll jets we're concerned with. They're the only ones we have to keep single jet on.
193:57:26|T|CDR|Ken is off comm; he's suiting up.
193:57:28|C|Har|Roger.
193:57:38|C|Har|Hey, John, would you - would you tell Ken that on that boom out, our only concern is going coupled on the roll. So when he gets ready to do this burn, if he just wants to use X and Z and just leave his Y-translation - you know, make a 90-degree roll and burn a Z. Now, Ken can handle it any way he wants, but just let him know our only concern is coupled jets in roll.
193:58:09|T|CDR|Okay. Understand.

194:48:47|C|Har|Stand by.
194:49:36|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. Would you verify that you left Orion in Auto and not Attitude Hold?

195:01:22|C|Har|Okay, Ken. We don't have High Bit Rate. The way you can do this is -
195:01:29|T|CMP|What should they be, please?
195:01:33|C|Har|Okay. We just want the single jet authority in roll. That's the only thing we have to worry about the boom. And you're gonna have to burn out the - your Y as if you were trimming the plane-change burn, using that same roll and - roll 90 degrees to get rid of your Y.
195:02:08|T|CMP|If I go into attitude, I can get it all in - get rid of the Y anyhow, can't I?
195:02:12|C|Har|Say again, Ken?

195:29:28|C|Har|All righty. Then the first change is at 196:21. Delete the "Verb 48" and the "P20" and the "Set Omni." Just delete that group of data.
195:29:53|T|CMP|Okay.
195:29:54|C|Har|At 196:35, add "Enable all jets, except A-1, A-2, B-1, Bravo 2, Delta 1, Delta 2.
195:30:19|T|CMP|Hank, is that the SlM jett - jett configuration?
195:30:21|C|Har|Negative. This gives you couple jets in all axes but roll, and we want Quad 3 providing roll control. Now this is so FDO can get good tracking for TEI, and this is being coordinated with OSC and is acceptable to the Mapping Camera pads.

195:32:00|C|Har|That's correct. And following that, P20 Option 5 plus-X forward SIM attitude - to be there at 196:41. Noun 79, 0.5-degree dead band. High Gain, Pitch 10, Yaw 0 for AOS acq.
195:32:43|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, does that mean that the - that the jettison attitude is going to be very close to the P20 attitude?

195:35:11|T|CMP|Okay. T-start is 196:49:43.
195:35:25|T|CMP|And we'll have the Laser, On, and the IMC, On, and we'll go to barber pole plus 1.
195:35:33|C|Har|That's affirmative. And at 196:52, orbital science visual, King. That's Victor 4. It's on charts Delta 4 and Delta 5, window 5. And note that the visual runs until 197:02.
195:36:16|T|CMP|Okay. We'll cover King on window 5 when we go by it.
195:36:23|C|Har|Roger. And at 196:56 [196:44]: acquire mix - MSFN, Manual, Wide, Pitch 10, Yaw 0.
195:36:45|T|CMP|Okay. We'll acquire MSFN at Pitch 10 and Yaw zero, in Manual and Wide.
195:36:50|C|Har|Okay, Ken, and we'll save the rest of this until the next rev. You can go ahead and start dopping [sic - "doffing"?] and getting ready for the satellite jett.
195:37:00|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
195:39:40|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. Going off comm for doffing the suits.
195:39:44|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
195:39:59|T|LMP|Hank, before tomorrow, we'd like - well, right away, would - would you guys ask the suit people what we could do to get some lubrication into these wrist rings? John and mine are real tight, and we're get - finding them very difficult to lock. Over.
195:40:19|C|Har|Okay, Charlie. I'll do that.

195:55:08|T|CMP|Hank, I'm looking ahead here trying to find out where we have a Pan Camera turn-on, and I don't see it. Maybe I'm missing it somewhere. Can you - I thought you said something about we're supposed to have both a Mapping Camera and a Pan Camera pass.
195:55:22|C|Har|Roger, Ken. We get it on it just after AOS at 197:03 [196:52]. We got some more changes for you for that Rev, and we thought we'd read them up the first part of the rev, rather than clutter you up right now.
195:55:37|T|CMP|Why don't you clutter me up right now with those things, please.
195:55:41|C|Har|You want them now? Okay, 197:03 -
195:55:46|T|CMP|Yes, please. Go ahead.

195:57:13|C|Har|Okay, we're going to pick up that long run you had that; started down at Vogel and -
195:57:26|C|Har|- and went up to Lassell and Alpetragius end stopped. And then you picked up at the one down at Bullialdus. Well, Bullialdus -

196:44:45|C|Pet|Casper, Houston. How do you read?
196:45:22|C|Pet|Casper, how do you read Houston?
196:45:30|T|CMP|Hello there.
196:45:32|C|Pet|How you doing?
196:46:28|T|CMP|Okay, looks like we got a good lock now.
196:46:32|C|Pet|Okay. And, Ken, would you verify that you copied the Flight Plan changes at 197:03 and 197:05 that were given just prior to LOS.
196:46:51|T|CMP|Well, I don't know if I copied the ones that you think you gave. I copied some that said, "IMC to barber pole, and Pan Camera, Standby, Stereo, Power," and then something got started about orbital science photos, and that was all I got.
196:47:06|C|Pet|Okay, the first one there that you just read back was at 197:03; and at 197:05, we have "Configure Camera for orbital science, Command Module 5/EL/250/CEX intervalometer f/8, 1/250, infinity, 128 frames, magazine Romeo Romeo.

196:48:41|T|CMP|Okay, why don't you - can you give me some idea of how long it'll be? I'm - I - I don't know whether I have time to take my suit off or what.
196:48:57|C|Pet|Okay, Ken, that - that target position you're going to add are Vogel, and - and that goes all the way up through the cinder cone there. Actually, you're changing over at Alpetragius - a little jog, and then on up past the cinder cone. And you were originally scheduled to look at Bullialdus, and we're going to have to delete that because your track is too far to the north now. So, we're going to bring your groundtrack from the cinder cone right on up through Helmet and Gassendi and on up to Mersenius Rille, from D-11, 12, and 13.
196:49:41|T|CMP|Okay, you want to take one continuous strip.
196:49:43|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
196:49:44|T|CMP|Make one continuous strip from Vogel to Alpetragius to the cinder cone to the Helmet to Gassendi to the Mersenius Rille.
196:49:54|C|Pet|That's affirmative; except there will be that little jog at Alpetragius over to - to the right there and then on up through cinder cone and straight on up through Helmet, then Gassendi and on up to the rille.
196:50:08|T|CMP|Yeah, I understand that. I'm going to have to have some help on the f-stops, and I guess I'd rather have you call them out to me rather than have me try to write them down and jot them on a map and all that jazz.
196:50:20|C|Pet|Okay; we'll do that.
196:50:25|T|CMP|Okay; thank you. And can you give me a time for passage of Vogel?
196:50:30|C|Pet|Okay, hang on a minute.
196:50:45|C|Pet|Okay, it looks like 197:29 is for Vogel. And it'll be a continuous pass from that point on.
196:50:59|T|CMP|Okay; thank you.
196:51:07|C|Pet|Okay, and I have a couple of other updates at 197:14 and 15.

196:51:37|C|Pet|Roger. And right now, you're up to that point where you should go Image Motion, Increase, and Pan Camera, Standby, and all that stuff at 197:03 [196:52].
196:51:42|T|CMP|Okay.
196:51:50|C|Pet|Okay; and at 197:15 [197:03], we want Image Motion, Increase.
196:51:57|T|CMP|Stand by, please.
196:52:02|C|Pet|Okay. Standing by.
196:52:37|T|CMP|Okay, Don. Go ahead.
196:52:38|C|Pet|Okay, at 197:15 [197:03], we want Image Motion, Increase, barber pole, plus 3 steps/On.
196:52:52|T|CMP|Okay. Barber pole plus 3 at 15.
196:52:56|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
196:53:04|T|CMP|Okay. Is that - is that all for about 10 minutes, please?
196:53:08|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
196:53:10|T|CMP|Okay.

196:54:13|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
196:54:19|T|LMP|Okay. I think, looking back at the procedures during the back side pass, I think I've figured out what's wrong with the LM, but I'm not really sure.
196:54:31|C|Pet|Okay. Go ahead.
196:54:37|T|LMP|Okay. With the changes from yesterday that were not updated this morning, it looks like to me on Pages 16 and 17 of the Timeline Book, we came out of there with no AC power. Both Inverter breakers are Open.
196:52:58|C|Pet|Roger; understand. Due to the changes yesterday that were not updated today, on Pages 16 and 17 of the Timeline Book, you came out without AC power.
196:55:10|T|LMP|That's apparently what happened, and I think that the ATCA/PGNS needs AC to fire the jets - but I'm not really - to get the control voltage, but I'm not really positive.
196:55:21|C|Pet|They're saying here, Charlie, that AC is not required to fire the jets.
196:55:28|T|LMP|Okay. Then that didn't - hmm. Okay. Well, I don't know what happened, then.
196:55:34|C|Pet|Roger. Don't worry about it, Charlie. We're not.
196:55:48|T|LMP|Okay; fine. It's just - disappointing. Except for that one switch, I left everything just like you wanted it.
196:56:01|C|Pet|Roger.
196:59:55|C|Pet|Again, Casper, as a reminder, you should now be about through configuring the camera for orbital science, and we're about two and a half minutes away from the Pan Camera, Operate.
197:02:57|C|Pet|Casper, we've got a REFSMMAT for you any time you can let us have the computer.
197:03:13|T|LMP|Okay; you got - computer.
197:03:19|C|Pet|Right.

197:15:51|C|Pet|Roger.
197:15:52|T|CMP|Will it be too crowded for that?
197:15:53|C|Pet|Negative. I don't think so.
197:15:59|T|CMP|Say again, Don.
197:16:01|C|Pet|We'll hold off. Go ahead with your strip.
197:16:18|C|Pet|Okay. Looks like we're about a minute from Boboland [?].
197:16:24|T|CMP|Okay. I'm all set; thank you. And I'm starting with an f/8 and 1/250. And I'll wait for you to tell me when to change settings.
197:16:35|C|Pet|Roger. We'll do it.
197:22:54|T|CMP|Don, one of the things that I just noticed in passing Alphonsus is the dark halo craters. And each of those has a little amount of light material inside of the crater itself, just like all the rest of these craters around here. So maybe a dark halo is really an early stage in development.
197:23:15|C|Pet|Roger. We copy. And in a couple of minutes, Ken, we'll have you go to f/5.6. I'll call you on time.
197:23:32|T|CMP|Thank you.
197:24:55|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. In about 15 seconds, you should be north of Bullialdus, and we'll have you go to f/5.6 at that point.
197:25:10|T|LMP|Hey, right now, I'm just passing Lassell C, looking straight down.
197:25:14|C|Pet|Roger.
197:25:56|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. Go to 5.6 as you get up - a beam of Bullialdus.
197:26:09|T|CMP|Okay. Abeam Bullialdus; I'll go to 5.6.
197:26:12|C|Pet|Roger.
197:27:03|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. In about a minute or so, we'll be up by Helmet. And, at that time, we'll want to change the shutter to 1/125.
197:27:18|T|CMP|Okay.
197:28:10|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. Looks good on 1/125 on the shutter, and you should be coming up by Helmet pretty soon now.
200:21:30|P|PAO|<b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control at 197 hours, 41 minutes [197:29]. Our Return to Earth Officer is in the process of computing a preliminary set of numbers for the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver, That maneuver will start Apollo 16 on its way back to Earth [and] is scheduled to start at 200 hours, 33 minutes [and] 20 seconds [200:21:30] Ground Elapsed Time. And the burn will be performed with the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine will be about a 2 minute, 50 second maneuver. And with the completion of that burn a splashdown time will be set at 266 hours, 2 minutes [and] 7 seconds. That time is subject to change a little bit but the time of Entry Interface will be quite fixed once the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver has been performed. We also have some times for Acquisition of Signal with and without the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. If the burn is performed as planned, the Acquisition of Signal time as Apollo 16 comes around from behind the Moon after performing the burn will be 200 hours, 43 minutes [and] 10 seconds [200:31:20]. If for some reason the burn is not performed as scheduled on the 65 revolution, the Acquisition of Signal time will be 200 hours, 52 minutes [and] 50 seconds [200:41:00]. Looking a little farther down the Flight Plan, the time now for Mid-Course Correction Number 5 is 217 hours, 34 minutes. And the time for the CSM EVA is 221 hours, 5 minutes. Correction on that the - yes, that would be hatch open [at] 221 hours, 5 minutes for hatch open, and hatch closed at 222 hours, 15 minutes. In Central Standard Time that would compute to 4:47 pm Central Standard Time the hatch open and 5:57 pm central standard time for the hatch closed. And again the splashdown time that we are looking toward is 266 hours, 2 minutes 7 seconds. We expect that that number will probably be updated somewhat following the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver.

We would like to point out that these numbers that were just passed along for such events as TEI, the Mid-Course Correction, the Trans-Earth EVA and splashdown all do not take into account the fact that we are expecting to do a clock update. That clock update will move the clock ahead about 21 hours [and] 50 minutes. That 21 hours [and] 50 minutes will have to be added to the times that we have given - to the GET times that we have given, in order to keep them in sync with the time we'll be using in Mission Control once the GET update has been done. We still haven't settled precisely on when that update will be made. The primary purpose for it is to bring the clocks into synchronization with the Flight Plan. At this point there are two things we can do. We can either go through the Flight Plan as we have been doing up to now and changing all of the times that are in the Flight Plan to make them agree with the clock or, and this is a more simple procedure, we can simply change the clock to make it agree with the times that are already in the Flight Plan. This eliminates a great deal of changes that have to be made to the Flight Plan and will be done at a convenient point. However, just when that point will be reached we haven't decided on yet. It will be sometime after the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. The Central Standard Times, of course, are not affected and they will remain the same for the hatch open, hatch close.

197:38:31|C|Pet|Okay. And you can go Pan Camera, Off, now. And you can go Laser Altimeter, Off.
197:38:46|T|CMP|Okay. The Laser's Off. The Pan Power's Off. And I'm going to Standby on the mapper.
197:38:52|C|Pet|Roger.
197:39:02|T|CMP|And the Image Motion is Off.
197:39:04|C|Pet|Roger. Okay. And then we want to do Mapping Camera, Retract.
197:39:53|T|CMP|Mapping Camera's Retracting .
197:39:56|C|Pet|Okay.
197:41:01|T|CMP|Okay, Don. You want to talk about that - the cue card change, or whatever it was you were getting ready to do awhile back?
197:41:07|C|Pet|Roger. And verify that you've got Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover Closed.
197:41:16|T|CMP|No, sir, I haven't. Just now got the camera in.
197:41:20|C|Pet|Okay; then we want Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover Closed, and enable all jets.
197:41:28|T|CMP|Okay. We got the Cover Closed.
197:42:07|T|CMP|Okay. The jets are configured.
197:42:09|C|Pet|Okay. We need to go to Block on the computer. And, Ken, it looks like that circ flag has not been set. I'm sorry; it's set. It needs to be reset.
197:42:27|T|CMP|You :mean - you mean the numbers, Verb 45?
197:42:33|C|Pet|Stand by a minute. Verb 45, Ken.
197:42:54|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. And we've got one note on the Service Module RCS system. I got a TEI pad, couple more changes to the Flight Plan, and a SPS cue card change for you. And you can copy them in any order you want.
197:44:15|T|CMP|Okay. Let's start with your RCS notes. And then following that, let's take the Flight Plan, and the - I think - Let's take the RCS, the cue card, the Flight Plan, and finally the pads.
197:44:30|C|Pet|Okay. The RCS note is we want the Service Module RCS Secondary Propellant Pressure switches, four, Open. And that's to prevent the primary fuel tank depletion during TEI.
197:44:47|T|CMP|Don, did you copy?
197:44:54|C|Pet|Roger, Ken. I copied you. And I had started reading there on the RCS note. Did you read that?
197:45:02|T|CMP|No, sir. I hadn't ... -
197:45:03|T|CDR|No, we missed you.
197:45:07|C|Pet|Okay. I'll - I'll try it again here. The Service Module RCS Secondary Propellant Fuel Pressure switches, four, Open. And the purpose for that is to prevent primary tank fuel tank depletions during TEI.
197:45:31|T|CDR|Do that right now?
197:45:36|C|Pet|Stand by one. That's affirmative. That's affirmative. We want to go ahead and do it now.
197:45:58|T|CDR|Got four, Open.
197:46:02|C|Pet|Okay. Now the SPS cue card. Let me know when you're ready to copy.
197:46:16|T|CMP|Okay, Don. Go ahead. And why don't you give me an outline of what is first, so I have some idea of what to do, and then I'll work on the card. We can go back and do it in detail.
197:46:24|C|Pet|Okay. First of all, about a third of the way down the page, we've got a note on the - on PNGS operation for TEI, and then we've got a couple or three words to add down about nine lines from the bottom on the gimbal trim and verify manual thrust vector control. And we're gonna say there, "Except Yaw." And seven lines from the bottom, we're going to have you open the Pitch 2 and Yaw 2 Battery B circuit breakers to keep the Secondary system from getting an - or sensing an overcurrent and shutting itself down. And on the back of the card, we're going to reclose those two circuit breakers after the Delta-V Thrust Stop.
197:47:13|T|CMP|Okay. Is there some reason you think that we need that added protection this time?
197:47:19|C|Pet|I guess it's just a feeling that if you get into TEI and you lose the primary system and you're on the Secondary system, you don't want the Secondary system to - to sense an overcurrent and shut down. And we're gonna pull these circuit breakers to make sure that that control system continues to function.
197:47:19|||<p class="tech"><b>197 47 4l Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's always the case. I just wondered if there was some reason that you were suspicious that might be more appropriate thing to say this time.
197:47:51|C|Pet|Negative. We don't have any - any evidence that says that's likely to happen or any more likely to happen.
197:48:06|T|CMP|All right. Is that the - that's the context of the changes?
197:48:11|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
197:48:21|T|CMP|Okay. Now let's take it from the top.
197:45:24|C|Pet|Okay. About a third of the way down the page then, we want to add, "PUG Mode, Aux; Oxidiser Flow Valve, Normal, Secondary." And in a comment, we want to add - "Do not -
197:48:49|T|CMP|Would this be - Is there something different about this than what we've done here - for all of the other burns?
197:49:03|C|Pet|I think just the "PUG Mode, Aux" is the only change.
197:49:14|T|CMP|Okay. You want to go PUGs, Mode to Aux. You want to leave the Oxidiser Flow Valve in Secondary. And the position of the valve in Normal. Is that correct?
197:49:26|C|Pet|That's affirmative. And we do not want to move the Oxidiser Flow Valve during the burn.
197:49:35|T|CMP|Okay.
197:49:36|C|Pet|Okay. Then nine lines from the bottom, where it says "Set GPI trim, verify MTVC," we want to add the words, "Except Yaw.
197:49:57|T|CMP|Roger.
197:50:01|C|Pet|Okay. And seven lines from the bottom, we'd like to add "Circuit breakers Pitch 2 Battery B, Open, and "Yaw 2 Battery B, Open.
197:50:20|T|CMP|Okay.
197:50:23|C|Pet|Okay. And on the back of the page, after the "Delta-V Thrust, two, Off," we want to close those circuit breakers. That's Pitch 2 Battery B, Closed, and Yaw 2 Battery B, Closed.
197:50:43|T|CMP|Okay.
197:50:46|C|Pet|Okay. That does it for the cue card.
197:51:08|T|CMP|All right. Give me the Flight Plan now, if you will, please.
197:51:11|C|Pet|Okay. At 198:40 in the Flight Plan.
197:51:21|T|CMP|All right.
197:51:23|C|Pet|Okay. We want to add a waste water dump to 10 percent.
197:51:34|T|CMP|Okay. We'd have gotten that down further, but we just - just couldn't get it all done the last time.
197:51:39|C|Pet|Okay. And that's somewhere between the P52 and AOS, anywhere you want to stick it.
197:51:47|T|CMP|Okay.
197:51:52|C|Pet|Okay. And at 199:45 [199:33] -
197:52:10|C|Pet|At 199:45 [199:33], we want to add -
197:52:12|T|CMP|Don, you gave me that at 199:40, didn't you?
197:52:16|C|Pet|Negative. That -
197:52:17|T|CMP|You gave me that waste water dump at 199:40 or 45?
197:52:21|C|Pet|Negative -
197:52:22|T|CMP|You had me -
197:52:23|C|Pet|- It was 198:40 [198:28] on the waste water dump.
197:52:29|T|CMP|Okay. That makes more sense. Thank you.
197:52:35|C|Pet|And at 199:45 [198:33] -
197:52:37|T|CMP|All right. Go ahead.
197:52:39|C|Pet|At 199:45 [198:33], we want to add "Load EMP 509.
197:52:50|T|CDR|Okay. "Load 509 at 199:40 [199:28].
197:52:55|C|Pet|Okay. That's 199:45 [198:33]. And now I've got the preliminary TEI-64 pad.

198:50:18|T|CMP|Okay. 200:07:27, 31:33, 43:09, and 52:48.
198:50:26|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
198:50:57|T|CMP|(Laughter) I would suspect that you can probably throw this one back in that jett bag, too, then. There. Thank you.
198:51:13|C|Pet|And, Ken, you're on air to ground.
198:51:19|T|CMP|Thank you.
198:52:31|C|Pet|Okay, 16. I've got some numbers on the RCS Delta-V. I believe they're at 200 hours and about 15 minutes in the Flight Plan now.
198:52:45|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead now.
198:52:48|C|Pet|Okay. Pre-TEI, you've got 75 feet per second; post-TEI, you've got 111 feet per second.
198:53:01|T|CMP|Okay. Pre is 75 and post is 111.
198:53:05|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
198:53:10|C|Roo|And, Ken, have you got a couple of minutes to listen to a few words about servo loop.
198:53:19|T|CMP|Okay. Go right ahead, Stu.
198:53:21|C|Roo|Okay. That's a real good system you've got on your second loop. We have got the simulator swinging right with the characteristics of your spacecraft. And this is the way it's going to look to you if you have to use it. Prior to ignition, the gimbal is going to be oscillating plus or minus - approximate - at about a degree - 0.9 - something like that or, in other words, 1.8 peak to peak. But once you get Thrust On, there's a side load on your bell from the LOI burn, and this side load acts as a damper. Since the load is cyclic, it really doesn't matter which direction the load is; it damps out. Under CMC control, it will damp out in a few seconds and burn very steady. In SCS, Auto, it damps almost immediately and then is steady throughout the rest of the burn. In Rate Command, however, since you're continually pulsing it with an input, it continues to oscillate pretty much at this same magnitude, or amplitude, throughout the burn. However, as far as you controlling it, it really doesn't matter. However, sitting in the simulators we don't get the real live shake effect that you're going to get. The spacecraft is going to shake and shudder; however, your attitude will remain virtually unchanged. And, I guess, the only advice that I could say would be that if you download - if you could go to SCS, Auto, you would save those excessive clutch currents that you get under Rate Command with this continual oscillation. And I guess I'll stop there, if you've got any questions.
198:55:26|T|CMP|No, that sounds - that's good information, Stu. I'm glad to hear that. Do you - you got any cute tricks in the back of your mind on how you can download from Rate Command and then go back to Auto without getting a big transient due to the mistrims?
198:55:45|C|Roo|No. I - I think - now I tried it - purposely having at least, say, a degree mistrim and - when I would switch, and you'll get the transient, but the bell will - will steady out. Now, I think going ahead and flying it in Rate Command is - is acceptable; however, you are - you are getting the bell oscillating, and you are putting, you know, the currents through there. This attitude -
198:56:14|T|CMP|Okay. I get the - Sounds like - if you could - you could damp the rates - damp the oscillations quickly by getting it into Rate Command - I mean the - Auto and then use the old thumbwheel procedure to change the pointing accuracy if you aren't pointing in the right direction.
198:56:44|C|Roo|Yeah. You - you don't have much control with that - with that thumbwheel in - in the Auto. I think, probably, I would take it in Rate Command, go back to my attitude, recycle my BMAGs, uncage them again at my - at the attitude I wanted, and then accept the trim - the mistrim in the - in the gimbal and - and let that damp out. I think you're going to be hard put to try to guess - guess your thumbwheel setting. However, let us think about that a little bit; and, also, I'd like to say this has been checked. I talked with North American this afternoon. This all agrees with the hardware evaluator, as far as our characteristics, so I think we're pretty close to your spacecraft.
198:57:39|T|CMP|Okay. That's outstanding. Sounds like you guys have done a mighty thorough job. My first choice then would be to - I think, based on what you said right now, just do the natural thing and take the oscillations unless they're excessive, and look - just download in the normal manner and ride it out.
198:58:01|C|Roo|Okay. That sounds - I think that's very -
198:58:03|T|CMP|So, as the first choice, I think we'll do the normal thing and burn CMC.
198:58:12|C|Roo|By all means, yes. CMC is - is prime, or you can - you can download -
198:58:15|T|CMP|Yes, okay.
198:58:16|C|Roo|- You'll be in Rate Command, and you will have the bell shaking. It'll start to damp a little bit; but every time you hit with an impulse, why, you'll excite the oscillation again.
198:58:31|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you very much, Stu.

199:01:15|P|PAO|<b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. Our spacecraft communicator for the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver will be astronaut Don Peterson. He is accompanied at the Capcom console by astronaut Stu Roosa, who a few moments ago was discussing with Ken Mattingly from his experience in the simulators what Mattingly and the crew of Apollo 16 should experience. If for some reason they had to switch over to the backup guidance system to control this Trans-Earth Injection maneuver, with the problem that they have had with the thrust vector control, how that system would control, and what they should expect to see and feel. In essence, Roosa's comments, from operating with a similar system in the simulator, were that the backup system should control very well. But there will be some oscillations due to the oscillation in one of the two axis of control of the thrust vector control system which transmits the commands to the SPS engine bell that gimbal it from side to side and up and down. In the yaw direction there are some oscillations in the backup control mode. However, Roosa found that with a precise sort of a set up that the Apollo 16 spacecraft has, and what he described as some sideloads that are characteristic of the way this engine is burning. It will damp out most of the oscillation shortly after the engine ignites, and would control properly, and would control the burn very well. This again, we'd reiterate, is a backup control system from everything that we've seen on the primary control system is expected to function normally and give the same excellent account of itself that it has in previous burns. The advice to Ken Mattingly, in the event that there is some unforeseen problem with the primary control system, is that he would go on around, not perform the burn, let us take a look at the primary system back on the frontside of the Moon. See if there would be any way of restoring that, and if not, the burn would be performed with the backup system which we would also expect to do a very good job of controlling the maneuver.</p>    <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control.

199:14:01|C|Pet|Will do, Ken.
199:14:06|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
199:17:18|C|Pet|16, I've got about four more updates to the Flight Plan, any time you want to copy. At about 200 hours and 43 minutes is the first one.
199:17:32|T|CMP|Okay. Go ahead.
199:17:35|C|Pet|Okay. There's a list of items at 200 hours and 43 minutes, and we want to add to that list "Pan Camera V over H override to high altitude.
199:17:51|T|CMP|Okay, Pan Camera V over H to high.
199:17:56|C|Pet|And at 200 hours 46 minutes, we want to change from "Barber pole plus three steps," to "Barber pole plus two steps.
199:18:10|T|CMP|Okay. That's plus two.
199:18:12|C|Pet|Roger. And at 200 hours and 56 minutes, we want to change from "Gamma Ray, Deploy" to read "Gamma Ray, Deploy to 8 feet," and that's "59 seconds.
199:18:31|T|CMP|Okay. Gamma Ray, Deploy at 8 feet, 59 seconds.
199:18:40|C|Pet|Okay. And at 201:082 we've got "Maneuver angles to Moon UV attitude are roll, 174; pitch, 212; yaw, 64; and the High Gain Antenna angles are Pitch, minus 73; and Yaw, 12.
199:19:09|T|CMP|Okay; 174, 212, and 064 for the attitude, and High Gain, minus 73 and 12.
199:19:18|C|Pet|Readback correct, and that's all the Flight Plan updates we've got right now.
199:19:25|T|CMP|Okay, Don. Down here where it says "Pan Camera, Mapping Camera film should be expended," I'm gonna let those things run until you guys tell us that you're either tired of taking pictures or something, because we're not going to run out, I don't imagine - at least not at this point.
199:19:44|C|Pet|Okay, 16. Understand the Pan Camera will probably run out, but the Mapping Camera may take quite awhile.
199:19:53|T|CMP|Okay. I suspect it's probably to our advantage, even though the cutter works good, that we probably ought to go ahead and run it out. That's your call though.
199:20:05|C|Pet|Okay, 16. I think that's what we plan to do.
199:20:10|T|CMP|Okay.
199:20:22|C|Pet|And, 16, it'll take about 3 hours to get rid of that mapping camera film, if we run it all the way out.
199:20:30|T|CMP|Okay. Is that what you want to do or did you want to just go ahead and cut it tomorrow? It's no difference to us.
199:20:39|C|Pet|We'll let it run out, Ken.
199:20:44|T|CMP|Okay.
199:20:44|||<p class="tech"><b>199 10 Peterson:</b> 16, can you verify that the sub-satellite deployed on time?

199:30:43|C|Pet|Stand by one. Okay, 16. You can go to burn attitude.
199:30:51|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, sir.
199:32:03|C|Pet|16, would you verify Limit Cycle switch, Off.
199:32:10|T|CMP|No. As a matter of a fact, it's on right now.
199:32:16|C|Pet|Okay. We'd like to have that switch Off, please.
199:33:07|C|Pet|And, 16, we'd also like you to verify once more, although we're sure you're going to do it this way anyway, that you're going to leave the Optics Power switch on during the burn, because that will decrease the probability of the - of the glitch occurring.
199:33:26|T|CMP|Okay. I didn't realize that it would. We would have left it on, but thank you for telling us.
199:33:31|C|Pet|Roger.
199:33:31|P|PAO|<b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo control. A few moments ago Ken Mattingly reported the spacecraft was beginning to maneuver to the proper attitude for the Trans-Earth Injection burn. We expect when they do that we'll momentarily lose lock on with the High Gain Antenna. In fact, we are hearing a bit of increase in the noise level now and we just had break in the lock. We'll be reacquiring [and] should have a good solid lock up again shortly. In the mean time we'll continue to have rather noisy communications between the ground and the spacecraft. And communications controller here INCO reports that we should be locking up shortly on an Omni antenna. And we've just done hat. We've got good solid lock on now. As an additional note of interest on the interference problem that we're having with the Lunar Module transmitter which is as we said on the same frequency as the sub-satellite. We're predicting that the LM batteries will die at about 211 hours ground elapsed time give or take an hour and a half. So at about 211 hours we should be able then to command the sub-satellite and to begin receiving data from it. Now there is a small possibility that we'll get a lock on the Lunar Module for a long enough period of time that we can command it to shift frequency so that we no longer have the interference problem. However, as soon as the LM breaks lock it will again revert to the original frequency so this would only be a temporary assist in the problem. And, until 211 hours plus or minus an hour and a half we don't expect to be getting any consistent data from the sub-satellite. We' re showing now 19 minutes, 25 seconds until we lose radio contact with Casper. As the spacecraft goes around the corner behind the Moon it should be in the proper attitude for the burn and flight controllers here will be getting a last look at all the systems and we'll be giving the Apollo 16 crew [the] Go for Trans-Earth Injection.</p>    <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo control.

199:40:12|T|CMP|Go ahead.
199:40:14|C|Pet|Okay. For the first 15 degrees past the terminator, the settings are 5.6, 1 over 125, and infinity; from 15 degrees to 30 degrees, it's 5.6, 1 over 250, and infinity; and past 30 degrees, it's 8, 1 over 250, and infinity.
199:40:48|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, Don. The first 15 degrees, it's 5.6, 1/125; and, from 15 to 30, it's 1/250; and, from 30 on, it's f/8 and then 1/250. Thank you.
199:41:00|C|Pet|Roger. And just a couple of additional comments here. The P20 attitude is going to differ slightly from what you've got in the Flight Plan, due to the fact; that we're using a different TEI REFSMMAT. It's a very small change and probably not very significant. But we didn't want it to surprise you. And the TEI rev is different, of course. That's going to give us a slightly different terminator, so we've been advised that you can turn the Mapping Camera and the Pan Camera on a couple or three minutes early, if you'd like since we got a lot of film.
199:41:39|T|CMP|Okay. We'll put those things on as soon as it's practical. And you - did you want to change the Noun 78 load, or are you just saying that that will give us a different set of gimbal angles?
199:41:53|C|Pet|The Noun 78 load is correct, it'll just give you a slightly different set of gimbal angles.
199:42:00|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
199:42:02|C|Pet|Roger.
199:42:09|T|CMP|And the 509 flag is set.

200:36:39|C|Pet|Roger. Hope they come out nice.
200:36:45|T|CDR|This Moon is really - is really a fascinating satellite. Boy, there's something new and different, and - and you can sure see a lot of variety from this view right here. This is almost -
200:37:01|T|CDR|This is even more spectacular almost than the Moon - than the Moon in earthshine when we're coming in here just -

200:40:56|T|CDR|The - the earthrise was just beautiful, and it just -

200:44:23|C|Pet|Roger.
200:44:28|T|CDR|That's from horizon to horizon along the equator. And we are really climbing away from the planet. You can just see it getting smaller by the second.

200:52:52|C|Pet|Barber pole plus 2, 16.
200:53:13|T|CMP|Okay. You've got it now. Is there anything else we have out of configuration?
200:53:17|C|Pet|I think not, but stand by a minute.
200:53:41|T|CMP|You know, you can sort of sense a - From where we're looking right now, you can sense a swingout in this big arc back toward the Earth. I'm looking right now at my 12 o'clock out the hatch window. Seems like we're almost climbing right away from the center of the Moon. And I can see the whole - Mare Crisium is spread out up to the north, and on our groundtrack, well, just north of our groundtrack, you can see Messier A and B Craters and Langrenus.
200:54:30|C|Pet|16, we can go ahead and get the Gamma Ray deployed to eight feet. That's 59 seconds.
200:54:40|T|CMP|Okay. I'll do that. Eight feet to 59 seconds. And this is the one place we can get a good view of Humboldt that we got on our first pass there.

200:55:17|T|CMP|Okay. Don. You want those deployed for 59 seconds. Is that affirmative?
200:55:20|C|Pet|Roger.
200:55:30|T|CMP|I guess in SIM bay attitude, the only thing we have been able to see so far is Sea of Kovalsky, and Charlie said he got a view of it out his window. So I guess we've - just about now we're able to see the whole Moon. Boy, we're really moving away fast.

200:59:59|T|LMP|Pete, did CST come back with anything on those wrist rings?
201:00:06|C|Pet|Stand by one, Charlie. We'll check on it.
201:00:32|T|CDR|You know, as we move out from the Moon, I think that by looking at the varied structures on the surface, that we can see from here, I guess my impression of it is that the Moon may be 4 billion years old plus, but it sure had a - and it may eventually have stopped growing after the first 500 million or changing dynamically, like the Earth changes, but during that first 500 million years, it was certainly busy cause it really has a lot of variety down there, and we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of com - complexity of the story. That's my personal opinion.
201:00:32|||<p class="tech"><b>201 0l 20 Peterson:</b> Roger. Charlie, on the problem with the rings, I guess we don't really have an answer for you, and we may get some more in the morning. But there's no apparent good way to do anything about that. We don't have a cleansing agent or a lubricant that we can use on them. I guess you'll just have to use more force on them.
201:00:32|||<p class="tech"><b>201 0l 45 Duke:</b> Fine. With - we can get them locked with a little force, and they pass checks okay, once we get them on.
201:01:53|C|Pet|Roger.
212:53:36|P|PAO|<b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> The ring that Charlie Duke was asking about is the glove lock ring. The problem that he described is in getting the gloves locked onto the suit and you heard him say that it does take some force to do it, but once they get it done, and get the gloves locked in place they're maintaining a good seal and the suit is passing suit integrity check alright. The recommendation, from Capcom Don Peterson, was that there is little we can do about cleaning the grit out of those wrist locks. They looked into the possibility of perhaps pouring water into them but they felt that that would only turn the dirt that's in there to mud and would really not improve the situation any. So the crew was advised to leave them as they are and apply the necessary force to get them locked. It appears that this will cause no problem. Apollo 16 at the moment is 1,766 nautical miles from the Moon continuing to climb out rapidly, although the velocity is dropping off, down now to 6,245 feet per second. And about 12 hours from now or at 212:53:36 seconds the spacecraft will again cross that mythical line we call the Lunar sphere of influence. At that point they will be under the dominant effect of Earth's gravity. We'll have our displays switched over from Moon reference to Earth reference and we'll begin seeing Apollo 16 accelerating toward Earth.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> The ring that Charlie Duke was asking about is the glove lock ring.

201:04:51|T|CMP|Okay. We won't go anywhere.
201:06:43|C|Pet|Okay, 16. The Verb 49 at about 201:07 [200:55] in the Flight Plan, for the UV photography, should have been started, oh, about 10 minutes ago.
201:06:57|T|CMP|Okay. We'll go to it now.
201:07:00|C|Pet|Roger. And it's correct as you have it now.
201:07:43|T|CMP|Okay, Don. This is the 174, 212, and 64, right?
201:07:47|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
201:08:08|C|Pet|And, 16, we've got a REFSMMAT, if you're ready to Accept?

201:10:49|C|Pet|Roger.
201:12:42|T|CMP|Okay, Don. Go ahead with your updates.
201:12:47|C|Pet|Okay. I've got this Verb 49 maneuver that's at 201:30 [201:18]. We want to change that from a maneuver to thermal attitude to a ramu - maneuver to Sco X-1 attitude. And the angle - the new angles are at 347, 071, 000, and the High Gain is minus 36, and Yaw is 176. And we also want to add Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open, at that point.
201:13:38|T|CMP|Okay. And we've got a Verb 49 maneuver to Sco X-1 and the attitude is 347, 071, and 000. The High Gain is minus 36 and 176, and we'll open the Alpha/X-Ray Cover.
201:13:52|C|Pet|Roger. And at 202:25 [202:13] -
201:14:02|T|CMP|Okay. Just a second, I had - we hadn't updated our time this far. Well, we're going to get a clock sync here when we -
201:14:08|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. I wouldn't bother updating the time very much further because you're going to do a clock resync here at 202:20 [202:08].
201:14:22|T|CMP|Okay. Well, I stopped an hour too soon.

201:14:36|T|CMP|All right sir.
201:14:37|C|Pet|- going by the old numbers where it was 224:18 or so, which is now about 202:25 [202:13]or so, we want to delete that Verb 49 maneuver. And at 202:25 [202:13] or thereabouts, we will resync the clocks, and that'll bring you up - the clock'll come 226:30, so we'll pick up with the nominal Flight Plan, which will have you going to bed a couple hours earlier tonight.
201:15:10|T|CMP|Okay. Very good. Thank you, sir. Okay, and then what do we do about this - can we do our PTC REFSMMAT change at the same time we're in this attitude?
201:15:27|C|Pet|Say again?
201:15:31|T|CMP|Can we do our PTC REFSMMAT change while we're in this Sco X attitude?
201:15:42|C|Pet|Oh, I'll have to advise you, Ken. Stand by a minute.
201:15:57|T|CMP|No, sir. I'm timing it.
201:16:00|C|Pet|16, you can go ahead with the maneuver. You'll have about a 68-degree gimbal angle.
201:16:11|T|CMP|Say again.
201:16:17|C|Pet|And, 16, we need to up-link a REFSMMAT to you before you get into the P52.
201:16:25|T|CMP|Roger. You have the up-link now.
201:16:29|C|Pet|Okay.
201:16:30|T|CMP|I guess the question - I'm not sure if we got the right question and answer together. Can we do the PTC REFSMMAT platform change in the Sco X-1 attitude? Maybe that's the question you answered, I'm not sure.
201:16:56|C|Pet|16, the answer to that apparently is yes, but you will wind up with a 68-degree gimbal angle.
201:17:05|T|CMP|Okay. Did you plan for us to do it some other time? Or -
201:17:25|C|Pet|Oh, 16, if the 68-degree middle gimbal angle is acceptable to you, we would like for you to go ahead and press on with it.
201:17:33|T|CMP|Okay. We'll do that, and that'll get us back on time. And we're looking at a 64-degree angle now, so 4 more isn't going to be that different.
201:17:44|C|Pet|Roger.

The total change will be 24 hours 34 minutes and 12 seconds. And what we would like you to do is on, let's see here, Page 338 in the Flight Plan, we'd like you to pick up at about 226:30 in the Flight Plan -
202:05:22|T|CMP|Hey, Don, (laughter) I'm sorry you're gonna - Hey, Don, you're gonna have to start over again. Just as you started talking, our cabin fan let out a great big moan, and so we turned it off then, after all sitting up straight to see what it was. So would you start over again?
202:05:41|C|Pet|Okay, I'll do that. If you'll go Accept, we've got the clock sync ready to go, and it'll be a 24 hour 34 minute and 12 second total change in the clocks. And what we would like you to do is pick up the Flight Plan at the old - at the old point of 226:30, actually pick up those events, although your clock may not come out exactly on that time. And what we're saying is we may cut a little bit into your rest period.
202:06:12|T|CMP|Okay; but we're planning to do a little stowage here that we never have had a chance to get done.
202:06:19|C|Pet|Roger.
202:06:20|T|CMP|So we're going to have to do some of that stuff now.
202:06:23|C|Pet|Okay. The items we'll pick up with, I guess, are the ones immediately following 226:30 [201:55]in the old Flight Plan.
202:06:35|T|CMP|Okay.
202:07:17|C|Pet|Okay. Ken, your clock should be changed now. And if you'll pick up with - on Page 338 where it says, "Gamma Ray, Shield Off," you can go ahead and finish that stuff up.
202:07:29|T|CMP|Okay. I take it we're gonna hold off on this PTC for a while until you've had enough time in this attitude?
202:07:40|C|Pet|Stand by one.
202:07:53|C|Pet|Roger. We'd like to stay away from the PTC for about 15 more minutes.
202:08:00|T|CMP|Okay; we'll do that.
202:09:32|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We'd like you to close the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover now, but we want to leave the X-Ray on for an extra 30 minutes because we failed to get some calibration data, and I'll call you when it should go off.
202:09:32|||<p class="tech"><b>202 l0 52 Peterson:</b> 16, did you copy on the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover?
202:11:03|T|LMP|Roger.

202:11:15|T|LMP|Okay, I closed the cover.
202:11:19|C|Pet|Okay. And, also, we'd like you to read out T<sub>ephem</sub> for us. That's Verb 5 Noun 1 1706 Enter.
202:11:51|T|CDR|How's that look to you, Houston?
202:11:54|C|Pet|Stand by one; we'll take a look at it.
202:12:01|C|Pet|Okay, 16. That looks good.
202:12:04|T|CDR|That's three balls 11, okay.
202:13:03|C|Pet|Okay, 16. On those numbers you've got on the DSKY there, if you'll go to the G&N Checklist, Page 9-4, you can load Register 2 and 3 in column Bravo, Lines 4 and 5.
202:13:26|T|LMP|Okay, G&N Checklist, 9-4, what - load what?

202:13:47|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. We have now completed the clock sync and update, synchronizing the clock aboard the spacecraft and the clocks here in Mission Control with an updated time, advancing them 24 hours, 34 minutes [and] 12 seconds. Faced with the choice of making the Flight Plan agree with reality would require updating events item by item to account for the difference in time introduced when the LM landing was delayed and the subsequent early departure for Earth, or making reality in effect agree with the Flight Plan we've chosen to do the later. Which means that we moved the clocks ahead 24 hours, 34 minutes and 12 seconds. And having completed that we're in effect back on the normal Flight Plan. At present time our clock reads 227 hours, 11 minutes 20 seconds . And at this point in the Flight Plan the crew will be preparing for their rest period. We've asked them to go back and pick up items about 30 minutes prior to that. Which includes putting the spacecraft in the Passive Thermal Control mode, rotating it about its longitudinal axis at the rate of 3 revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature equilibrium. Completing that they'll then begin their pre-sleep checklist and probably begin the rest period around 227:30 [202:44] although we expect that they will be a little late getting to this. And will begin the sleep period probably 30 to 45 minutes after that. That's somewhere around 228 to 228:30. In making this clock update it should now eliminate the need for most of the Flight Plan updates that we have been forced to make for the last several days. The clocks now agree with where we should be in the Flight Plan. An arbitrary change keeps all of the sequences as they should be and the intervals between the events where they should be. And we'll also have another clock with a nomenclature TV 5, which would be viewable on the - on the monitors in the news center, which is counting the actual ground elapsed time. Which is 202 hours, 17 minutes. But [the] time that is in sequence with the Flight Plan is the updated time, which now reads 227 hours 3 minutes. This time by the way, is arrived at by taking the Flight Plan time for Entry Interface and subtracting the predicted Entry Interface time, using the original or the older GET, the previous GET before we updated, then subtracting the Entry Interface time that we would have with our previous GET or Ground Elapsed Time, from the Entry Interface time that is showing on the Flight Plan. Now we come up with the difference in time, which is taken care of in the clock update of 24 hours, 34 minutes and 12 seconds. This then is the time that is used for the clock update. And as mentioned previously, we are now more or less back on the nominal Flight Plan. Now there would be several minor changes, but nothing like the number of changes that we have been experiencing for the last several days.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

203:11:45|T|LMP|Man, I tell you. That ascent engine coming on, you - you - it was a real - It wasn't what I expected, anyway. At ignition, there, it seems like it sort of sits a little bit, then it grabs you and, boy, off you go! And it takes you a while - at least, it did for me - to get my eyeballs uncaged. And we were - then all I saw out the window was the MESA blanket; then we were back on the gages.
203:12:15|C|Pet|Roger. It looked like you lifted out of there pretty rapidly.
203:12:21|T|CDR|Yeah; that machine just flies so nice. It's just unbelievable! But once you get to ascent stage, it's really light and responsive. Boy, you fire one of those thrusters and it does exactly what you want it to.
203:12:36|C|Pet|Roger.

203:19:16|T|LMP|But then the rest of you will stand on your heads.
203:19:41|T|CDR|Okay; I don't know if you can see this or not. See this dirty hand?
203:19:46|C|Pet|Oh yeah, we can see that.
203:19:47|T|CDR|See that? Can you see the dirt under those fingernails - can you see the dirt under those fingernails?
203:19:52|C|Pet|Roger.
203:19:53|T|CDR|That's Moon dust. You talk about a - you talk about two dirty human beings. It took 10 minutes before we could get Ken to open the door. As soon as he saw us, he wanted to close it.
203:20:09|C|Pet|Roger. We understand. He runs a neat ship.
203:20:12|T|CDR|And we're still that way. Yeah, wait'll you see some of these rocks. And we've - and some of the data that Ken's got. That's really something. The Moon around Alphonsus. I got a chance to look at it today for the first time, and - it's really - it's really a strange place. How's everybody doing down there at MCC. Is everybody starting to take it easy for a change?
203:20:45|C|Pet|Oh, I think we're all breathing easy now. And if we can, we'd like to get a quick look at the CMP because we're going to have to give up the lines here in a couple of minutes.
203:20:55|T|LMP|Okay. Will do.
203:21:08|C|Pet|The only - the only really neat guy on the crew.
203:21:21|T|LMP|What'd you say? You must be blind.
203:21:27|T|CDR|He does dress pretty well.
203:21:30|T|LMP|Notice the reflection off the bald head?
203:21:42|T|LMP|Did the Surgeon do a back flip on that one?
203:21:46|C|Pet|Negative. He's not agile enough.
203:21:57|T|LMP|Ken doesn't look like he is either.
203:22:02|T|CDR|(Laughter) I told you, in a J-mission spacecraft, you - you either have to be a midget to do that, or have thought about it a lot before you try it.
203:22:17|T|LMP|Okay. We're going to sign off here.
203:22:25|C|Pet|Okay. Thanks a bunch, guys. We'll being talking to you again in a minute.
203:22:31|T|LMP|Okay. Thanks, Pete. We'll go back to SCI on the S-Band Aux.
203:22:43|C|Pet|Okay. And for thermal reasons, as soon as you can, we'd like to go on now and get into PTC.
203:22:50|T|LMP|All right. We'll start up.
203:22:52|T|CDR|We're for that.
203:23:06|T|LMP|What's happening down in there?
203:23:11|C|Pet|Say again, Charlie.
203:23:17|T|LMP|Get any newsy items for today?
203:23:22|C|Pet|No. I guess we don't have anything going on right now, Charlie. Everything's routine. If you want a news report, we can dig one up, I think.
203:23:37|T|LMP|No, it's not important. Wondered what - We haven't had an update for a while; y'all must have ran out of paper.

203:29:10|C|Pet|Stand - stand by one.
203:29:28|C|Pet|Okay, 16. All we have is the G&N data. We don't have tracking data because you are uncoupled. However, based on the G&N data, it looks like less than one foot per second.
203:29:42|T|CDR|Yeah; but - course, I - Yeah, I forgot us - about us being uncoupled.

203:35:07|T|CDR|Hey, Tony, this is John. Over.
203:35:11|C|Eng|Yeah. Go ahead, John.
203:35:15|T|CDR|I don't know if we told you or not, but Charlie and I think you really did one whale of a job doing those EVAs. We know how tough that is to do all those real-time changes. We just thought you did one heck of a good job, and we sure appreciate it. Just wanted you to know that.
203:35:34|C|Eng|Oh, thank you much. But you guys made it awful easy.
203:35:42|T|LMP|Hey, Tony. I was sitting here today thinking about those rocks we got, and the thing that really strikes me is that there was - I really don't think we got any volcanic rocks to speak of. Maybe some of those little black clasts were volcanics, but otherwise - I don't think we got any. There wasn't any there. The - there was one other - one other point that could have been - Those ones we were calling shocks could have been a tuff breccia, since they were so friable. But - that we might - that might prove to be the case; but to us, they looked shocked due to the other features that we saw that - that - applied a shocked metamorphism. Over.
203:36:37|C|Eng|Right. We - From your description, we had thought there was a good chance that you might have gotten a tuff breccia there. I think, also, the fact that a lot of the breccias were one-rock breccias would in - would mean that you may have your basalts or gabbroic anorthosites or whatever, and that they're just broken up. If they're one-rock breccias or two-rock breccias, it still has most of the information of the - of the rocks we're looking for. It's not like a - you know - if you remember, it's not like a soil breccia, where everything is lost. So we - we're very happy with what you found. Also, did anyone brief you on the newest on the X-ray results ?
203:37:17|T|LMP|No. Go ahead.
203:37:18|C|Eng|Okay. You remember the first look I gave - The first look that I reported to you indicated that the aluminium-to-silicon ratio was sort of intermediate. Well, they've gone back; and with the newer data and a better analysis, it turns out that Descartes has one of the highest ratios on the Moon. The only place we've seen like it right now is on the east side of Smythii. We don't really have a good comparison yet with the east of Crisium. But anyway, it indicates that if any place has anorthosites, you've found them.
203:37:56|T|LMP|I tell you, Tony, some of those rocks that we picked up - I was leaning, with the color and the crystalline structure that we had - they really gave me the - I didn't want to call it that, but they were certainly crystalline rocks; and there was no question in my mind. They had a sugary texture - the whitish ones. That big - one on the - rim of North Ray, there, with the shatter cone that had - a - a bluish tint to it in the crystalline structure. Although, it might have been just the - an aph - I say crystalline structure, or it might have been an aphanitic matrix; but y'all are gonna sort all of that out when you get bagged ones. I tell you, it really wasn't what we thought - I thought we were going to find up there. I imagined a lot of volcanics; and frankly, if the - if these shocked rocks turn out to be tuff breccias, that will be the only volcanics we found.
203:39:02|C|Eng|Right. Understand. I think -
203:39:04|T|CDR|...
203:39:05|C|Eng|- the fact that you recovered from the picture we had given you before you went and went ahead and found out what was there and sampled it so well - I think that's - a good indication that the training was good and you guys are really on the ball.
203:39:26|T|LMP|Well, we tried hard, anyway, Tony; and I think we got every - a piece of every rock that was up there. I really do. They were - and that's, I think, because we were lucky, and the rocks were identifiable.
203:39:46|C|Eng|You know, the -
203:39:47|T|LMP|...
203:39:48|C|Eng|- difference between a rock being identifiable mad not being identifiable is the level of training. That just says you guys were well trained.
203:39:58|T|LMP|Well, you guys tried to beat it into us long enough, I'll tell you that. Hope we did a good job.
203:40:08|C|Eng|I just got a set of questions that the geology team -
203:40:11|T|LMP|It looks like -
203:40:12|C|Eng|- would like to send up to you sometime. Maybe sometime during the Trans-Earth coast, we'll have a chance. I haven't really read through them, so I don't know what they're all about yet.
203:40:26|T|LMP|Okay. Well, we're gonna go into an eat period and a an EVA prep and try to get some rest before the EVA tomorrow, so - we'll wait on those. Okay?
203:40:34|C|Eng|That's fine. Hey, we have the TV back on on the Moon up there, and everything's looking fine. It hasn't changed much since you left.
203:40:47|T|LMP|Well, we were glad that y'all were able to watch lift-off. We heard that they got about 30 or 40 seconds, which, I think, was neat. It took me about that long to uncase my eyeballs when that ascent engine lifted off.
203:41:01|C|Eng|(Laughter) Yeah. Great.
203:41:03|T|LMP|It certainly wasn't what I thought I was going to - experience.
203:41:09|C|Eng|Yeah. INCO was really on the ball. They tracked you right up.
203:41:15|T|LMP|Well, that's just super.
203:41:21|C|Eng|I don't know - We don't know whether Ken understood the up-link while ago on the biomed harness. The idea is that he's going to have to change it before the EVA in the morning. So, if he'll sleep better without one on tonight, he could take the old one off, now.
203:41:40|T|CDR|Okay. We'll tell him.
203:42:23|T|LMP|And, Tony, the only - on that - on the rocks, back to one other little point, there. That - You know, we called the whitish rocks tuff breccias- I mean, shocked rocks. But we're cou - at least, I'm personally convinced that there are at least two endogenic craters that we passed, and - the big one on the way to North Ray and the big one coming back from - from Stop 8. And so, that might have been a source of a tuff - if that's what they turn out to be.
203:43:03|C|Eng|Very good. I just want to emphasize again that -
203:43:10|T|CDR|... situation, though.
203:43:12|C|Eng|Right. I understand. I just think it was outstanding, maybe serendipity, that we probably - your landing there at Descartes probably sampled the most differentiated place we could find on the front side of the Moon. I think that's really outstanding.
203:43:34|T|LMP|That's the feeling I got when we started seeing those rocks. That - that basalt that I called under the engine bell there, I think, might end up to be that blackish-bluish rock that we sampled up at North Ray, and so - we'll - but we'll see. We couldn't get any of what I call real basalt in rocks. Maybe some of the clasts will be, though.
203:44:03|C|Eng|Okay.
203:44:05|T|CDR|Could you tell from the TV, Tony, how rough that place was? Could you see all those - those swales and valleys that we didn't have mapped on our - that didn't show up on our map that were maybe, some of them, 30, 40, 50 meters deep?
203:44:24|C|Eng|Yeah, I sure could. It reminded me of a dune area.
203:44:30|T|CDR|Yeah. That's what it sort of looked like, sort of a dunes plains.
203:44:36|C|Eng|Incidentally, somebody here is kind of worried about -
203:44:39|T|CDR|I'll tell you -
203:44:40|C|Eng|- thermal problems, and we would like to get into PTC as soon as possible..
203:44:45|T|CDR|Okay, as soon as the thing - as soon as the rates get low enough, we will.
203:44:49|C|Eng|Okay.
203:44:51|T|CDR|Are the rates good enough now?
203:44:54|C|Eng|Negative.
203:45:06|T|LMP|Tony, that one - that crater at - the endogenic one that we described coming back from North Ray and going out, it - I was guessing 80 meters, John said about 50, but it was really deep; and I'm surprised that we didn't - I sure had no feel for that before we started.
203:45:32|C|Eng|Right. Understand.
203:45:44|T|LMP|I'll tell you one thing, your hair sure doesn't feel very good aft - up here after 3 days with it full of orange juice.
203:45:52|C|Eng|I don't know. It may do great things.
203:45:57|T|LMP|That stuff is great glue, I'll tell you. Boy, we were really worried about those hel - getting those helmets off, but they came - came right on off after we eventually broke the thing and got them cleaned up then.
203:46:11|C|Eng|Okay, and on your Flight Plan there, at right about 227:00, for setting up for PTC, I guess your DAP has to be set up for B/D Roll.
203:46:24|T|LMP|Okay.
203:48:45|T|CDR|Houston, can you give us a holler when these rates get good enough to start PTC?
203:48:50|C|Eng|Sure will.
203:50:18|C|Eng|Apollo 16, last time you changed the LiOH canister, did you happen to wiggle the other one and see if it had swelled up in there?
203:50:28|T|CDR|No, we sure didn't. That one out of B just came right out.
203:50:32|C|Eng|Okay.
203:50:43|C|Eng|Okay. Don't worry about it, then.
203:50:52|T|CDR|Okay.
203:52:13|C|Eng|Just a brief report from the home fronts here. Everybody's healthy, and happy, and not just little bit proud.
203:52:27|T|CDR|Boy, you had me worried there for a second.
203:52:30|T|LMP|Thanks, Tony. Appreciate it.

We do have an updated time now for the EVA from the Command Module.

212:45:09|T|CMP|Good morning, Henry.
212:45:10|C|Har|Good morning. Is everybody wide awake and feeling great this morning?
212:45:19|T|CMP|You even gave us an extra hour.
212:45:35|C|Har|We're coming up on antenna switch, and I think the comm is a little bad; but, right off the bat we'd like for you to remain in PTC.
212:45:47|T|CMP|Okay.
212:45:50|C|Har|And we'd also like for you to take the Up Telemetry Command switch Off for three seconds. We've got that same commanding problem we had during coast out to the Moon.
212:46:14|T|CMP|Okay. It's Off and back to Normal.
212:46:17|C|Har|Roger.
212:46:45|C|Har|That cured up the commanding problem.
212:46:52|T|CMP|Good show.
212:47:12|T|CMP|Hank, before we copy the Flight Plan updates, do you want us to start on the 236-hour item?
212:47:22|C|Har|Roger. We'd like for you to get started on the postsleep checklist. And, rather than read you a bunch of things to start with, I think I'll just remind you of a few things to catch you up. I've got a list of them here. While you're doing that, if we could get somebody to pull the Gamma Ray boom in, I'd appreciate it.
212:47:41|T|CMP|Okay. You want that all the way in?
212:47:51|C|Har|That's affirmative. And you'll need your Logic Powers to get that in.
212:47:53|T|CMP|All righty. Thank you, sir.
212:48:12|C|Har|And we'd like to get the S-Band Normal Mode switch to Voice.

212:48:27|C|Har|Okay.
212:48:32|T|LMP|We couldn't talk to you if we weren't in Voice, Pete.
212:48:40|C|Har|Roger. We were in Down Voice Backup there and then Command in Normal.
212:48:50|T|CMP|I got you.
212:49:23|C|Har|And, Ken, for your information, we've scrubbed the corona window calibration and the Skylab contamination photos.

213:10:08|C|Har|Outstanding.
213:10:25|T|CDR|Okay. Here's the crew status report, starting with the - A - item A-1 for the Commander. Skip the PRD. It's in the pressure suit, which is in the bag, and it's down - and it's very dusty, and I'd like to wait until we get ready to suit up for the EVA and I'll read you the PRD then.
213:11:02|C|Har|Okay, John.
213:11:03|T|CDR|A-3: Day 8, 7 hour - 7 hours, good sleep, nope. A-4: none. Day 9: still skip the PRD reading for the same reason; 6&frac34; hours, good sleep. A-4: none.

C-3: 7 hours, good sleep. C-4: none. And, Charlie remembered to get his PRD reading - reading machine out today, and C-1 is 21143. C-3: 7 hours, good sleep, C-4: none.
213:13:16|T|CDR|Did we lose you doing any of that, Hank?
213:13:20|C|Har|Negative, John. We got it all.
213:13:25|T|CDR|Okay. Now, on to the menu. When we got back to the - to good old Casper here - We're working on Day 8, meal C. And for the CDR, substitute a hamburger for beef gravy, and scratch the gingerbread. And for day 9, Meal A: scratch the peaches and the grits. Day 9, Meal B: scratch the hamburger and add meatballs with sauce. For day 9, Meal C: scratch the pecans. And, for the CMP -
213:15:54|T|CDR|Okay. For the LMP, with all of Day 8, scratch the mixed fruit, the ham steak, the white bread with jelly. On meal B: scratch the pea soup, the meatballs, the pork, and escalloped potatoes. Meal C: scratch the chocolate bar and a gingerbread and add pi - pineapple and a hamburger. On Day 9; scratch the peaches, the scrambled eggs, and the bacon squares on meal A. On Meal B: scratch the hamburger and white bread, the instant breakfast and the cereal bar. Meal C: scratch the pecans only. On the Duke: [sic], Day 8, last meal, scratch the beef and gravy and substitute a hamburger. And, scratch two-thirds of a chocolate bar. Scratch the gingerbreads. On Day 9, Meal A: scratch the peaches. And on Meal B: scratch the hamburger and - in a wetpack and the - and the cereal bar. And, add turkey and gravy. On day 9, Meal C: scratch the pecans only and add an orange drink. I think that about does it.
213:18:47|C|Har|Thank you, John. The surgeon's happy, and we didn't get any biomed on you last night. Could you check your system. Or, you have any idea why it didn't work?
213:19:07|T|CDR|I sure had it plugged in. I had it plugged in the night before last, too. I don't understand that. I got the leads tight -
213:19:31|C|Har|Okay. We're getting a - the carrier, John. We're just not getting modulation. So, there must be something fouled up in the system, there.
213:19:41|T|CDR|Okay. Well, why didn't you tell me, I could have changed this sensor out' - or this - it's probably in this box here, don't you reckon?
213:20:01|C|Har|Okay. When you get a chance, John, just check it out.
213:20:32|C|Har|And, we were - we lost our data on the antenna switching with your P52. Could we get those angles, please?
213:21:00|T|CDR|You - you have any idea what it might be that I could do to fix this -
213:21:55|C|Har|16, Houston.
213:24:37|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We just went through an antenna switch there, and I lost anything you said, then. And, John, if you're asking about the sensor there, the only thing we could suggest is to check the connections there into the blue signal conditioner and maybe change out your sensors or service them.
213:24:59|T|CDR|Okay. I can't - I can't believe that if you got the carrier that changing out the sensors is going to change anything. These things are really stuck on there. Let me try something.
213:25:23|C|Har|Okay. Whatever you did, John, worked. We got us a signal there.
213:25:31|T|CDR|I didn't do anything.
213:25:46|T|CDR|... working now?
213:25:49|C|Har|It's working now. And what - what angles are you showing on your High Gain now, on your meter?
213:25:58|T|CDR|Showing - 50 - minus 50 in Pitch - make it 45, and about -
213:26:21|T|CDR|2 - 260 in Yaw.
213:26:35|C|Har|Okay. They want to know now what's on the knobs.
213:26:44|T|CDR|Okay. It's - right now, it's reading minus - We'll get the Pitch, minus 40 and minus 40 on the knob - and it's reading 90 Degrees in Yaw and still about 265 in Yaw in - on the indicator.
213:27:04|C|Har|Roger. And, 16, we'd like to get that P52 data.
213:27:21|T|CMP|Okay. We've got stars 50 and 22; Noun 05: all zeroes; Noun 93: minus 0.040, plus 0.030, plus 0.058; torqued at 213:23:55.
213:27:38|C|Har|Roger. We got them.
213:28:38|C|Har|And, 16, whenever you're ready, we'll give you a few of these changes.
213:29:11|T|CDR|Okay. Charlie's ready to copy.
213:29:13|C|Har|Okay. At 238:20 [213:33] in the Flight Plan.
213:29:26|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
213:29:29|C|Har|Roger. Gamma Ray Shield, Off. Stand by, Charlie. they say it's already off -
213:29:37|T|CDR|The Shield's Off right now, Hank.
213:29:39|C|Har|- ... scratch that.
213:29:43|T|LMP|We just turned it Off, Hank.
213:29:45|C|Har|Okay. In that next group of data there, delete anything that refers to the Mass Spec, since we don't have it any more.
213:29:54|T|LMP|Okay.
213:29:58|C|Har|And, about 238:50 [214:03], we want Gamma Ray Shield, On.
213:30:13|T|LMP|Okay.
213:30:16|C|Har|And, the group of data concerning the P30. We want to start the P30, actually, around 238:46. But, we'll have to get you up-linked, and we're working on that now.
213:30:34|T|LMP|All right.
213:30:40|C|Har|And, you'll exit PTC prior to that - just put that in just ahead of the P30.
213:30:48|T|LMP|Okay. Exit PTC right in front of the P30.
213:30:52|C|Har|Roger. Using the SIM bay jett configuration.
213:31:09|T|LMP|All right.
213:31:10|C|Har|And, as soon as we get the sextant star check there on over at 239, we'll go ahead and get the dumps out of the way.
213:31:24|T|LMP|Okay. We will. We'll start the dumps right after the star check.
213:31:28|C|Har|Okay. At 239:30 [214:43], the High Gain angle -
213:31:34|T|LMP|Hold the phone a minute.
213:32:11|T|LMP|Okay. Go ahead.
213:32:13|C|Har|At 239:30 [214:43] -
213:32:37|C|Har|Do you read, Charlie?
213:33:03|C|Har|16, Houston. How do you read?
213:33:09|T|LMP|You're 5 by, Hank. Go ahead.
213:33:12|C|Har|Okay. At 239:30 [214:43], those High Gain angles should be minus 16 and 58.
213:33:27|T|LMP|Copy. Minus 16 and 58.
213:33:30|C|Har|Okay. And if you'll flip on over to page 351.
213:33:39|T|LMP|Go ahead.
213:33:40|C|Har|Okay. As we call - we need another hour for suit donning. So, that time there at 241, at the top of the page, will now be 242 [217:13]. So, there's actually an hour's gap between the previous page and this one. And, you can change your time accordingly, adding an hour on to - You get down to hatch opening or until you get on the EVA cue card. And, then we'll pick up the Flight Plan after the EVA. Now, at 242 hours - that's after it's changed there where it says Verb 49 maneuver to EVA attitude, the new attitude is 037, 043, 038, and the High Gain angles are minus -
213:34:26|T|LMP|Roger. 03 -
213:34:27|C|Har|- High Gain is minus 10, 244.
213:34:41|T|LMP|Okay. We change Verb from 49, angles to 037. The other two are the same. High Gain, minus 10, 244.
213:34:57|C|Har|Okay, Charlie. They just changed that Yaw angle while I was reading it up. It's 224.
213:35:07|T|LMP|Okay. 224.
213:35:10|C|Har|Okay. Down about - a few lines down where it says, "Load MEED attitude - that attitude now is 071, 051, 039.
213:35:30|T|LMP|Copy. 071, 051, 039.
213:35:40|C|Har|Okay. And if you'll flip the page now - Page 352 - the new time there is 243:40 [218:53]. Where it says, "Maneuver to MEED attitude," we want to change that again to 071, 051, 039, and the High Gain angles are minus 34, 218.
213:36:18|T|LMP|Okay. At the - this whole page has slipped an hour, and it's at 243:40 [218:53]; 071, 051, 039, to minus 34 and a 218.
213:36:35|C|Har|Roger, Charlie. And, we need to make those - those appropriate changes on the cue card and then the EVA Checklist. And, I - I have those locations, if you want to do that.
213:36:52|T|LMP|Well, we'll do that, Hank. We promise.
213:36:55|C|Har|Okay.
213:37:17|T|LMP|Is that all you've got for now?
213:37:19|C|Har|That ought to take us through the EVA, Charlie.
213:37:23|T|LMP|Thank you, sir.

213:59:59|T|CDR|Okay.
214:00:04|T|CMP|Hank, I had a question here. You said to exit the - use the SIM bay jett configuration. Then, I notice where you called out for a plus-X four jet on the Mid-Course. Are those two things compatible?
214:00:28|C|Har|Roger. What happened there, Ken, was we were gonna do a Gamma Ray extension for a little - out a little ways, and we've - we've cancelled that now, so that's not even a requirement anymore. You can use normal jet configuration.
214:00:48|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.

214:07:21|T|CMP|Haven't gotten around to looking yet, Hank.
214:10:37|T|CDR|Okay, Hank, at arm's distance, if you cup your fingers around it, it's about as big as a 50-cent piece. But you can sure tell that it's changed size for the smaller, but we still feel like we're still pretty close to it. Like I - I don't know how far away from it we are, but, probably about - maybe 25 or 30,000 miles.
214:11:07|T|CDR|No, Ken tells me 53.
214:11:14|C|Har|Roger. We show you about 30,000.
214:11:15|T|CDR|30,000? Okay.
214:11:23|C|Har|Take it back; they rewrote about 38,000.

214:39:57|C|Har|We were hoping you were grabbing some snacks in there early this morning.
214:40:06|T|CMP|Man, with three guys in here, Hank, you just - when it comes time to eat, you just bring everything to a halt and go do that that's - because everything has to be done in the kitchen. You got to take your 52s and you got to do everything else right in one place. We'll grab something and we'll be pressing on here; we'll - we'll probably come pretty close to the schedule.

214:40:37|C|Har|Okay.
214:40:55|T|CDR|Hey, Hank, we just looked at - at the battery compartment pressure. We're reading 3.4. You want us to vent that thing?
214:41:04|C|Har|Stand by.
214:42:20|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. And I can copy your comments about the SIM bay now if you'd like to give them now, while -
214:42:28|C|Har|Okay. In regard to the Mapping Camera, they want to check the interference. Inspect the periphery of the Mapping Camera and Laser Altimeter for any evidence of interference. The last attraction on that thing was nominal -
214:42:44|T|CMP|Okay.
214:42:45|C|Har|- so it's kind of puzzling, you know. It started out real slow and each retraction it got faster.
214:42:53|T|CMP|... it's just getting warmed up.
214:42:55|C|Har|Roger. Some of the things they suggest you might look for is - around the cable, there, between the Mapping Camera and the shelf, is there any damage to the cable? Clearance in that area of the cable? And whether the cable is caught or curled -
214:43:15|T|CMP|Okay. Now, that cable is located on the - on the plus-X side of the camera over on the - towards the A quad, is that correct?
214:43:28|C|Har|That's affirmative.
214:43:31|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
214:44:05|C|Har|Okay. We want to know if that cable is caught or curled or is it smooth, you know, like it's supposed to? That's between the - what I would call the top of the Mapping Camera and the bay, there, by the handhold.
214:44:20|T|CMP|Okay. I know the area. I'm not sure we're gonna have enough light to see down in there in the EVA attitudes but we'll take a look at it.
214:42:34|C|Har|And we'd like to know a little something about the cuckoo door. You know which one that is? The little white door that goes over the stellar lens?
214:44:45|T|CMP|Okay. I won't be able to tell you much about that in the retracted position, either.
214:44:51|C|Har|Roger. If possible, we'd like for you to lift up that door and inspect the clearance between the hinge and the top of the Mapping Camera, and look for any scrape marks on the camera or on the door and any evidence of twisting or bending of the stellar lens glare shield.
214:45:11|T|CMP|Okay.
214:45:13|C|Har|Any question on that part with reference to the Mapping Camera, Ken?
214:45:20|T|CMP|Say again.
214:45:21|C|Har|Did you have any question about any of those Mapping Camera items?
214:45:26|T|CMP|No, sir.
214:45:30|C|Har|Okay. In regard to the Pan Camera, we'd like for you to look at the exposure sensor. And that's the ones that's immediately to the left of the lens barrel.
214:45:49|C|Har|And we need Auto on the High Gain.
214:45:55|T|CDR|Got it.
214:45:58|C|Har|Okay. In - In regard to that automatic exposure control sensor there, Ken, what we're looking for is foreign objects or contamination.
214:46:13|T|CMP|Okay.
214:46:14|C|Har|And the little thermal shield that goes around the periphery of the lens barrel, we want to inspect that for contamination, and also, the lens barrel itself. And we're really looking for contamination really on all of the Pan Camera, and the same goes for the V over H sensor.
214:46:36|T|CMP|All right.
214:46:39|C|Har|And just to refresh your memory, the V over H sensor is the one that's on the right side that's got the little hood on it.
214:46:47|T|CMP|Okay.
214:46:52|C|Har|And for the Gamma Ray boom, what we'd like to do is inspect the cover for any damage. You know, that thing has closed a couple of times and - or the boom has retracted all the way a couple of times and a couple of times it hasn't. So - so we're expecting that the Gamma Ray boom right now is about 6 inches out; but we're not sure. We'd like for you to look at the cover, and if it's not fully closed, give us an estimate of how far it's open. Full open is about 134 degrees.
214:47:24|T|CMP|Roger. I'm familiar with that.
214:47:26|C|Har|Okay. If the cover is partially open -
214:47:27|T|CMP|Okay. Is Brad [?] taking bets on where it is?
214:47:38|C|Har|He's not - he's not too brave. He'll bet you a cup of coffee it's about 6 inches.
214:47:48|T|CMP|Okay. I heard that. He's on.
214:47:51|C|Har|He said he takes it. And we'd like to know how far that rail protrudes through the bind there, and if you can see any obstructions to retractions, you know, like the harness, or the guides, or the loom cable fingers, proximity switches, any of those things - report them.
214:48:10|T|CMP|Okay.
214:48:12|C|Har|And that's all we want to know, Ken, other than any other things you might pick up from looking around out there.
214:48:22|T|CMP|Okay; do you require any kind of documentation on this?
214:48:30|C|Har|I guess we'll have to take verbal comment.
214:48:37|T|CMP|Okay.
214:48:48|C|Har|And, Ken, we'd like to vent the battery compart - compartment to 1 volt on your meter. Stop it at 1 volt.
214:49:01|T|CMP|Okay; well, all righty.
214:49:04|T|CDR|It drops like a stone; I don't know if we can do that or not. We'll try it.
214:49:17|C|Har|Give it a try.
214:49:43|T|CDR|We got 1.2 on there; you want to press and try for 1?
214:49:48|C|Har|That's real good, John. We'll hold it right there.
214:49:53|C|Har|And, Ken, the stellar camera's out of film, if you want to use a normal shutdown procedure on the Mapping Camera.
214:50:01|T|CMP|Okay.
214:50:49|C|Har|16, Houston. He kind of would like to know if that's the first time you've noticed that Bat vent or bat - battery compartment pressure above 1.5 volts?
214:51:17|T|CMP|John says that when they did the first charges they had to take it and vent it, but the charges I did I never saw it above 1.5.
214:51:27|C|Har|Roger. Copy. We'll probably be asking you for a check of that here in a little while, just to make sure it's not charging way on up there again.
214:51:35|T|CDR|Okay; we reported the other times that we vented it.
214:51:40|C|Har|Roger, John.
214:52:00|C|Har|And, 16; Houston. I'm gonna go off the loop a couple of minutes; Phil will cover for me.
214:52:08|T|CMP|That's not fair.
214:52:12|C|Har|But it's necessary.
214:52:18|T|CMP|Now you understand.
214:53:25|T|CMP|How are you doing today, Philip?
214:53:28|T|Shaffer|Doing very well, sir; thank you. And yourself?
214:53:34|T|CMP|Oh, we're having a ball. Just wanted to hear you on the loop.
214:53:37|T|Shaffer|Well, you've certainly done that. It's another first.
214:53:45|T|CMP|Well, always nice to have a few of those.
214:54:39|T|Shaffer|16, Houston. Are you gonna get to the mapper in little bit?
214:54:49|T|CMP|Sure will; thank you.
214:54:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston. That was Flight Director Phil Shaffer now talking to the - to the crew of Apollo 16.

215:03:34|T|LMP|Hank, 16.
215:03:37|C|Har|Go ahead.
215:03:41|T|LMP|Okay; the Bat B Charge is underway, and we've been watching this battery compartment, and we're back up to 2 now.
215:03:52|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
215:05:32|T|CMP|Hank, I don't really know what's going on with our antenna. It's - I get you the best signal strength by going to Manual and Narrow, and every time we switch to either Auto or Reacq, why, it seems to break - break some kind of beam switch lock, or something, and we've tried going to Manual and Wide and working in through Reacq and then bringing it down and things, and that doesn't help any. Would there be any future in trying the secondary electronics, the servos?
215:06:07|C|Har|Okay; INCO says we're just right on the line there. Why don't we just leave it in Manual and Narrow.
215:06:17|T|CMP|Okay.
215:07:04|C|Har|And, Ken, I'd appreciate it if from time to time, you'd just give me a idea of where you are in the checklist.
215:07:12|T|CMP|We is at the eat period.
215:07:14|C|Har|Hey, that's a good plan.
215:07:24|T|CMP|We'll be ready to start in on that checklist in probably about 10 minutes or so; but it just didn't seem like it was proper to go ahead and press on the rest of the day without stopping for something.
215:07:39|C|Har|I agree with you, and I guess we'd better terminate that Battery B Charge and keep an eye on that thing. If it gives - gets above 3, give us a call. And also -
215:07:53|T|CMP|Okay; why don't you call us back in about 30 minutes and ask us to look at it, because that's not the kind of position where we can keep an eye on it without making a conscious effort at it.
215:08:01|C|Har|Okay; we'll give you a reminder, and if it's above 3 or in that neighborhood, we're gonna want to vent it again back down to 1.
215:08:12|T|LMP|Okay; do you want to vent it now. It's at 2.
215:08:16|C|Har|Negative. We want to see if it'll stabilize.
215:08:22|T|CMP|Okay; you've got the - the Bat B Charge is terminated, and we'll watch the battery's compartment pressure.
215:08:46|C|Har|While you're eating there, I'll tell you a little local sports news. The Astros have won seven in a row now, and they are tied for first place in the division.
215:08:57|T|CDR|Wow, that's outstanding. Congratulations!(Laughter)
215:10:27|C|Har|16, if it's convenient, could we get a check on the Bat C voltage?
215:10:41|T|CMP|Okay. It's 36-1/2.
215:10:43|C|Har|Roger. Copy 36.5.
215:10:56|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. And John stuck the eyeball right closer to the meter, and it's 1.9 instead of 2.
215:11:03|C|Har|Roger, 1.9.
215:12:23|T|CDR|Okay. We're going to vent the battery - the bat compartment again, it's 2 and -
215:12:43|C|Har|Okay. If you want to try a vent, go ahead and see if you can stop it at 1.
215:12:50|T|CDR|Okay.
215:12:51|T|CMP|What - What's wrong if we go below 1, Hank?
215:12:56|C|Har|Well, the problem is there, Ken, if it's - at 1 volt, we're - at 1.5 volt, we're roughly equal to cabin pressure in there and, if you go much below 1 and we do have a battery that's venting, you could lose the battery, if it goes all the way to vacuum.
215:13:18|T|CMP|Okay. And that's the only problem?
215:13:21|C|Har|Roger. In other words, if the - if the battery - a battery has vented and the - and the vent doesn't reseal - and it - and it's not resealed, if you go to vacuum, the electrolyte couldn't go - go out of it.
215:13:35|T|CMP|Roger. I understand that. That's the only problem, though. Is that correct? It won't affect the other batteries?
215:13:40|C|Har|That's affirmative. It shouldn't affect the other batteries.
215:13:45|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you. We'll try it for 1 again.
215:14:04|T|CMP|Okay, it's reading 1.2 - about 1.3, I guess. We'll leave it at that for a few minutes.
215:14:53|T|LMP|Can y'all see the Bat Charger current down there, Hank?
215:15:01|C|Har|That's affirmative, and it's reading zero now, Charlie.
215:15:06|T|LMP|Okay. When I started Bat B charge, I was looking at Bat Bus B, and we got a negative amp - looked like to me a negative amps, off-scale, low on Bat B, and then I went to Bat Charger, but that should - but that didn't look right to me, so I stopped. And then I went to Bat Charger and started it and - again, and the bat charger current went up to about 2, which - or so, which looked nominal. The only question was that it looked like a reverse current or something, and - I guess that is true, isn't it, though, when you reverse current into a battery to charge it?
215:15:45|C|Har|That's affirmative.
215:15:50|T|LMP|Okay. So that's nominal? Okay. Thank you.
215:16:12|C|Har|Okay, Charlie. What we saw down here, I guess, when you started the - started the charge, it - it looked like that perhaps you hadn't pulled the Bat Relay circuit breaker; then you stopped and then - then it looked normal to us.
215:16:37|T|LMP|Okay. It's - it was open and the breaker is pulled. Or it's closed now, since the charge is terminated.
215:17:00|C|Har|And they also saw some funnies in your data. It looked like the charge started out on Bat A and then it went to Bat B.
215:17:13|T|LMP|Well, you got to go to the A position to get to B.
215:17:18|C|Har|Copy.
215:21:43|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. We're right - unstowing from A-2 into the top of page 3-2 now.
215:21:50|C|Har|Okay. Thank you.
215:23:29|C|Har|16, Houston, we got a - an answer to your question about the wrist rings on your suit.
215:23:41|T|CDR|Okay. We're not ready for that answer right now, thank you.
215:23:45|C|Har|Okay. Whenever you're ready, holler.
215:23:49|T|CDR|Okay.
215:33:52|T|LMP|Hank, on the battery compartment, we vented back down to 1, and it's back up to about 1 - 1.3 we vented to, and it's back up to about 1.8 now and seems to be stabilized.
215:34:08|C|Har|Okay, Charlie. Thank you.
215:35:42|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We got 5900 pounds in the OPS, and it's regulating at 3.7.

216:18:16|C|Har|16, Houston. When you get around to - prior to suit donning, we recommend that you lubricate those wrist rings using the maintenance kit that's stored in A-8. And you might try to work some of that lube in around the locking rings and work the ring several times to try to free them up a little bit - the locking rings.
216:18:43|T|LMP|Okay, Hank. We've already done that -
216:18:46|T|LMP|- we did that when we doffed the suits yesterday as best we could.
216:18:48|C|Har|Okay.
216:18:52|T|LMP|I'm not sure it had much effect, but we did it.
216:19:23|C|Har|Charlie, did you do the full lubing and cleaning, including the zippers, in accordance with the instructions in the maintenance kit?
216:19:33|T|LMP|Yes, sir. Just like we done it on the surface. We did the zippers, all of the O-rings, the neck rings, the wrist rings, and it seems to me, Hank, it's really not where the O-ring is. It's in the sliding part between the suit part and the locking part of it. It's stiff. You could see dust down in there, but you can't get it out too well.
216:19:57|C|Har|Roger. Copy. Only thing we could recommend there, which I'm sure you've already done, is just sock it a few times - see if you can free it up.

217:04:53|T|CMP|Hank, instead of making this maneuver to the EVA attitude at 242:00, suppose we do it as soon as we finish suit donning.
217:05:07|C|Har|Roger, Ken. You can do that whenever you're ready. When you do do the maneuver, we'd like for you to go Wide on the High Gain.
217:05:17|T|CMP|Okay.
217:06:34|C|Har|And, Ken, in regard to the - the attitude and angle changes, - the only thing on your EVA cue card that - that I saw that required changing was the High-Gain angles.
217:06:44|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by. Stand by. Stand by, please.
217:08:16|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. Say again what you had to say about the attitudes now, please.
217:08:20|C|Har|Roger. I read up the new attitudes and High-Gain angles to Charlie, and he was going to change the checklist and the cue card; and I just wanted to say that the only place on the cue cards I see that needs a change is the back side of your EVA card, the High-Gain angles right by the 50 18.
217:08:41|T|CMP|Okay. I've got that, and - it was minus 24 and 220; and now we want something different, huh?
217:08:55|C|Har|That's affirmative.
217:09:02|T|CMP|Okay. Now I've got a minus 34 and 218. Shouldn't that track throughout the maneuver? It used to. The old angles did.
217:09:22|C|Har|We hope it'll work in Auto TRACK, Ken, but this is just a precaution. We've been having a little trouble with that High Gain.
217:09:32|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you, sir.
217:10:05|T|CMP|And, Hank, on that - on that battery thing, it's back up to about 1.6 now. It came right up to 1.5, which it - that you're - that means that it's up to 1.6. Do you want us to vent that thing during the EVA to keep from getting excessive pressure in that chamber, while we have the cabin depressed?
217:10:29|C|Har|Negative, Ken. We'd like to watch it awhile.
217:10:36|T|CMP|Okay. That battery compartment will take it when we get the cabin down, right? Or at least relieve through the cabin?
217:10:53|C|Har|That manifold should take 200 psi, Ken. That was what it was qual'ed at, and the burst pressure is 600.
217:11:03|T|CMP|Okay. That's fine. You guys think there's a relief valve on one of those batteries that's ...?
217:11:11|C|Har|We're not - we're not sure. We kind of think that may be what's happening.
217:11:18|T|CMP|Okay. Do you have any evidence yet as to which battery?
217:11:24|C|Har|Negative.
217:11:27|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
217:11:46|C|Har|All those batteries are manifolded together, and all the voltages look normal. If we do drop a cell on one of the batteries, we should be able to pick that up.
217:12:00|T|CMP|Roger.

217:18:52|C|Har|16, Houston. Go Wide on the High Gain.
217:19:00|T|LMP|Hank, I just hit the yaw knob. What are the settings in our present attitude?
217:19:13|C|Har|Pitch minus 14, Yaw 58.
217:19:20|T|LMP|Okay. We got it.
217:19:53|C|Har|16, we'd like to stay Wide and Manual in the High Gain.
217:20:05|T|LMP|Okay. You've got it.
217:20:07|T|CMP|Are you going to want that during the EVA, Hank?
217:20:20|C|Har|That's affirmative, and we'll call it when we start the maneuver.
217:20:28|T|CMP|Okay. Wide gives you enough margin on the TV?
217:20:51|T|CMP|That was really a question, Hank. (Laughing) I didn't mean it as a statement.
217:20:56|C|Har|Okay. What's going to happen is: when we do get in attitude, we can bring it back to Auto and get it locked up; but we will need the Narrow Beam.
217:21:06|T|CMP|Okay. Because that's a - that's going to be a very difficult thing to try and tweak up in a hard suit.
217:21:12|C|Har|Roger. Understand.
217:23:13|C|Har|16, Houston. We're noticing that the glycol evap out temp is coming on down, and we need to adjust that mixing valve in. But rather than crawling under there and doing that right now, what we want to do is get you to take the Temp In switch from Manual up to Auto, and we'll give you a call when to put it back in Manual and see if that will cut it.
217:23:39|T|CMP|Okay. Is that going to have enough time delay - on your call that's going to - I guess - I guess I'm concerned about making it worse.
217:23:52|C|Har|Well, the temperature's dropping. We're going to have to adjust it one way or the other, Ken, and we're going to lead it.
217:24:01|T|CMP|Okay. We can always go back and do it manually if it doesn't work. All right. Do you want to do that - let's do it right now before our maneuver and make sure we don't lose comm in the middle of it.
217:24:09|C|Har|That's right. We'd like to do it now -
217:24:11|T|CMP|Going to Auto -
217:24:12|T|CMP|Mark.
217:24:13|C|Har|Okay.
217:25:27|C|Har|Ken, I know this is going to sound funny, but it looks like that mixing valve is working now. It didn't go up like we thought it would.
217:25:41|T|CMP|Okay. But we're going to have to make a configuration setting before we start the EVA, because we won't be able to get to it then. If we can find a place where it looks good, I'd like to leave it in Manual throughout the EVA, and we can try the Auto feature some other time.
217:26:01|C|Har|Okay. We'd like to put the switch back to Manual and maneuver to the EVA attitude, and we'll take a look when we get good comm there.
217:26:12|T|CMP|Okay. The Temp In switch is in Manual, and I'm going to the EVA attitude.
217:26:17|C|Har|Roger.

218:51:07|C|Har|Charlie, could you check and see if the Glycol mixing valve got bumped into Auto, the Temp In?

218:52:03|T|CMP|Yeah. All right. I will when I get here. Looks like it's hung up on something there.
218:52:17|C|Har|16, if you'll take the Temp In switch to Auto, please.
218:52:28|T|CDR|Okay.
218:52:38|C|Har|Okay, back to Manual on the Temp In.

218:55:20|C|Har|Charlie, can you verify the TV pole's aligned?
218:55:24|T|CMP|Okay, I'd say the service module is pretty well blistered. Did the picture shift? Are you not getting a good picture, Hank?
218:55:38|C|Har|It looks like it might be swung - swung a little too far to the left. We're not sure. That would be to Charlie's left.

219:01:54|T|CMP|Oh, man!
219:02:10|T|CMP|All righty. I got my feet well locked, and I got a good suit pressure, and cooling is just fine, and let me tell you a few things about the old SIM bay. Okay. The first thing that's real obvious to you out here is the - is the amount of bubbling on the service module paint. It's more - it's a bit more than I anticipated seeing and the radiator panel down to the right side of the SIM bay looks nice and clean. There's no bubbles on the paint or anything like that. The area right under the quad - I'll have to raise my visor to see - Yeah, I got the inner one still down. I will. Yeah, you don't need to remind me of that one.
219:03:13|T|CMP|Okay, the area directly under the quad doesn't look to me like it's blistered any more than the areas everywhere else around here. That's just a qualitative comment. The - in fact, the paint on the quad itself is as blistered. The area directly under the nozzle on the - the plus-Z jet on Quad B is all blistered. I can see that in the Sun. I can't tell about the other surfaces. Okay, looking now at the mapping - at the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray, I'm going to have to move aft to do that.
219:03:51|C|Har|Ken, I'd like to caution you on the Mass Spec to steer clear of that door there. It's very soft and it could bend and break and leave a jagged edge.
219:04:01|T|CMP|Roger. I won't touch it.

219:04:10|T|CMP|Yeah.
219:04:17|T|CMP|Sorry about that.
219:04:33|T|CMP|Okay, I've got a good handhold over here on the Pan Camera - this rail, so that's a good one, and now I'm over the Gamma Ray door and it's about open at, say, 30 degrees.
219:04:58|T|CMP|And I can't - I can nudge it, and it looks like it's hitting on the top of the Gamma Ray spectrometer itself. No, it isn't. It's not touching the Spectrometer. And I'm not real sure what it is jammed on. I can't see anything anywhere. The cover just feels like it's a little bit loose at about a 30-degree jiggle, and I can't see the mechanism to tell whether it's broken. The -
219:05:32|C|Har|Roger; can you see if the guide rails come through the SIM?

219:06:03|C|Har|Negative.
219:06:06|T|CMP|Okay, anything else on the aft end? I don't see any blistering of paint or anything. It's all clean in the aft shell.

220:39:33|C|Pet|Roger. Thank you.
220:41:21|C|Pet|16, we're going to try to bring up the High Gain on Pitch 48, Yaw 330. Go Manual and Wide.
220:41:36|T|LMP|Okay, plus 48, 330. Stand by.
220:41:39|C|Pet|Roger.
220:41:45|T|LMP|Okay; we got pretty good signal strength, about three quarters.
220:41:50|C|Pet|Roger. 16, let's try going Narrow on the High Gain.
220:42:08|T|LMP|Okay, coming in Narrow.
220:42:41|T|LMP|Okay, Pete, I tweaked up the pitch, and you got pretty good signal strength in Narrow Beam.
220:42:47|C|Pet|Okay, thank you.
220:42:58|T|LMP|Hey, Pete; 16 here. We'd like to see if EECOM can come up with a - something on this battery compartment pressure increase. It appears to us that something is venting in there. I'd like to tell you - Before we started the Bat B Charger, 3 or 4 hours ago - whenever it was. We failed to check it before we started. And when we started the charge, there was a slight odor that's hard to identify, but it smelled like insulation. Then we stopped the charge, reconfigured again - Mainly I stopped the charge because I was looking at the wrong thing. I was looking at Bat Bus B and I saw the currents go negative which is nominal, but - so I stopped the charge and went back to Bat B Charge, and it looked okay. And there was no odor. And then we looked at the Systems Test and we had 3 - 3 volts. We been venting it now on y'all's request. And we'd vent it to 1, and then it immediately starts climbing back to 01.45, and then it slowly increases and usually stabilizes out at about 2 or so. Over.
220:44:29|C|Pet|Roger; we copied. That's in work.
220:44:41|T|LMP|And I'd like to know right now how many amps we got in A, B, and C.
220:44:47|C|Pet|Okay, stand by 1.
220:45:19|C|Pet|Okay, 16. I've got the SIM bay basic configuration that we'd like to get you into as soon as we can. And I'll read them to you one at a time, and you can configure as we go along. The first one is Auto RCS Select, Off, except A1, B2, A3, C4, B3, D4.
220:45:52|T|LMP|Okay, stand by. That was a little fast. John is starting - you got A1. Go ahead, now.
220:46:13|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. It's -
220:46:15|T|CDR|Say again what thrusters you want.
220:46:17|C|Pet|Okay, we want Auto RCS Select, Off, except the following: Delta 1, Bravo 2, Alfa 3, Charlie 4, Bravo 3, Delta 4.
220:46:48|T|CDR|Okay, you got D1, B1, [sic] AB, C4, B3, and D4.
220:46:54|C|Pet|Roger; copy. Okay, we need to go PCM Bit Rate High.
220:47:05|T|LMP|We were in High.
220:47:07|C|Pet|Okay. And S-Band Aux TV to SCI.
220:47:14|T|LMP|SCI.
220:47:16|C|Pet|Alpha/X-Ray Experiment Covers, Close.
220:47:30|T|LMP|Okay. Alpha/X-Ray Experiment Covers Are Closed.
220:47:34|C|Pet|Roger. Gamma Ray Boom Deploy to Off.
220:47:40|T|LMP|Stand by. Roger.
220:47:54|T|LMP|It is Off.
220:47:57|C|Pet|Roger. Gamma Ray Boom Jett to off.
220:48:18|T|LMP|Okay. It's off.
220:48:20|C|Pet|Okay. Gamma Ray, Experiment On.
220:48:26|T|LMP|Gamma Ray's coming On.
220:48:31|C|Pet|Okay. Jett, Experiment off.
220:48:35|T|LMP|Okay, it is off. Jett, off. Roger.
220:48:39|C|Pet|Jett, Ion SOURCE. Verify off.
220:48:45|T|LMP|It's off.
220:48:46|C|Pet|Data System's On.
220:48:53|T|LMP|It's On.
220:48:59|C|Pet|X-Ray, On.
220:49:08|T|LMP|X-Ray is On.
220:49:10|C|Pet|And Logic Power 2 to Deploy/Retract.
220:49:16|T|LMP|Okay, stand by on those two.
220:49:26|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We've lost the High Gain. Let's go Wide and Reacq, and then step to Narrow like a normal acquisition.
220:49:37|T|LMP|Okay. Okay, we got the High Gain, Reacq and Narrow. Okay, Pete, the Logic switch is at Deploy/Retract. Go ahead.
220:50:07|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We need Alpha On, and that will complete the SIM bay configuration.
220:50:18|T|LMP|Alpha's On.
220:50:20|C|Pet|Roger. Thank you.
220:51:01|C|Pet|Let's go Gamma Ray, Deploy, for 17 seconds.
220:51:10|T|LMP|Roger. The Gamma Ray's going to Deploy for 17 seconds.
220:51:18|C|Pet|And, 16, would you verify Gamma Ray On?
220:51:24|T|LMP|Yes, sir. The Experiment is On.
220:51:27|C|Pet|Roger.
220:51:35|T|LMP|Hey, Pete, our Service Module/AC Power is Off right now - on 181.
220:51:43|C|Pet|That's the way it should be, 16. And -
220:51:49|T|LMP|Okay. Stand by and I'll get - Go ahead.
220:51:56|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. Did you get the Gamma Ray, Deploy, 17 seconds?
220:52:01|T|LMP|I'm gonna do that right now. Stand by.
220:52:03|C|Pet|Roger.
220:52:31|T|LMP|Hey, Pete. All our watches have floated off. Could you - I'll give you a mark, and give me a call in 17 seconds. Okay -
220:52:38|T|LMP|Mark. Deploy.
220:52:53|C|Pet|Now, Charlie, on the Gamma Ray Deploy.
220:52:59|T|LMP|Say again.
220:53:01|C|Pet|Stop the Gamma Ray Deploy.
220:53:10|T|LMP|I think I copied you. I'm now in Off on the Deploy switch.
220:53:28|T|LMP|Pete, are you reading? Over.
220:53:30|C|Pet|Roger. Say again, Charlie.
220:53:34|T|LMP|Roger; I wanted a mark on that Gamma Ray Deploy. We didn't have any ticktocks. All ours floated off here, and I couldn't see the Event GET Mission Timer. And I gave you a mark, and then I think you said turn it Off, so I'm now in Off on the Deploy switch.
220:53:50|C|Pet|Okay. We copy, Charlie.
220:53:54|T|LMP|Okay.
220:54:52|C|Pet|Okay, 16. Would you confirm that SEB 2 circuit breaker is closed?
220:55:00|T|LMP|No, they're both open too. We powered down the SIM bay as - per checklist for the EVA.
220:55:07|T|CDR|(Garble) for some things that you guys threw in there as per usual.
220:55:18|T|LMP|You want me to close instruments in ... equipment, too?
220:55:23|C|Pet|That's affirmative, 16.
220:55:27|T|LMP|Okay, Going closed -
220:55:28|T|LMP|Mark.
220:57:44|C|Pet|16, on your request on the amp-hours on the batteries: Battery Alfa is 36, Battery Bravo 30.3, and Charlie 39.0.
220:57:58|T|LMP|Okay. Thank you very much.
221:00:26|C|Pet|16, on the cryo configuration, we'd like O<sub>2</sub> tanks 1 and 2 to Auto; tank 3, Off.
221:00:37|T|LMP|Roger. You have it. 1 and 2 Auto; 3 is Off.
221:00:40|C|Pet|Roger.
221:01:32|C|Pet|And, 16, on the SIM bay, we'll call all the changes on the SIM bay in real time until you're cleaned up there and in a position where you can get back to the Flight Plan.
221:01:44|T|LMP|Thank you very much.
221:03:41|C|Pet|Okay, 16, and now we'd like to go Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open. And we'd also like to get one more reading on the battery compartment.
221:03:53|T|LMP|Okay, Alpha/X-Ray is going Open.
221:03:57|C|Pet|Roger.
221:04:00|T|LMP|And the battery is holding at about 221. Right around there.
221:02:06|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
221:02:07|T|LMP|And it might be climbing slightly, too.
221:04:08|C|Pet|Roger.
221:39:01|C|Pet|16, Houston. We've got a maneuver - Verb 49 maneuver at 246:30. I've got the attitudes and High Gain angles when you're ready.
221:39:12|T|LMP|Go ahead.
221:39:15|C|Pet|Okay; Verb 49 maneuver to X-ray attitude will be 174, 133, 032. And the High Gain angles are Pitch, minus 14; Yaw, 105; they want to go Reacq and Wide on the High Gain, and then step to Narrow in the normal way. And if you lose comm, go to Omni Delta.
221:39:45|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. We're - we'll start maneuvering at 30, and we'll go to 174, 133, 032. Angles on the High Gain, minus 14 and 105 and the normal acquisition.
221:40:02|C|Pet|Roger.
221:40:45|T|LMP|Okay. Do you want us to wait until 30, or can we start maneuvering now?
221:41:01|C|Pet|Stand by a minute; we'll check it. Okay, 16; you can go ahead with the maneuver now.
221:41:22|T|LMP|Okay.
221:43:47|C|Pet|16, let's go Omni Delta. We reacquired a High Gain when we went into a new attitude.
221:43:55|T|LMP|Okay.
221:48:20|T|CDR|Houston, we still got 1,300 psi on the OPS.
221:48:27|C|Pet|Roger; we copy.
221:48:28|T|CDR|That's being reported as per page - page X3-22.
221:48:36|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
221:48:39|T|CDR|In the middle of the page.
221:55:39|T|LMP|Houston, 16 on the High Gain.
221:55:41|C|Pet|Roger; loud and clear, Charlie. Or was that Charlie?
221:55:53|T|LMP|Say again.
221:55:55|C|Pet|Roger. wasn't sure I'd recognized your voice. You're loud and clear.
221:56:01|T|LMP|It's me. Got a mouth full of chewing gum.
221:56:10|C|Pet|Roger.
221:57:13|C|Pet|16, we've got a update to the G&amp;C Checklist on the PIPA bias changes, and also we're gonna play a little game with the mixing valve to try to reset it for the Trans-Earth coast. We can do that whenever you're ready.
221:57:32|T|LMP|Okay; do - we have something to copy for the PIPA bias?
221:57:36|C|Pet|That's affirmative. It's in the G&amp;C Checklist, page 9-4.
221:57:44|T|LMP|Okay; could you hold off on that? And we're sort of cluttered here now, and we - give me the mixing valve. Is that procedure down on below the couches or just up on the cockpit?
221:57:57|C|Pet|We can do this all from up in the cockpit. What we're gonna do - and I don't want you to do it now - but what we're gonna do is put it in Auto, and EECOM will sit here and watch the flow-rate change, and when we a - get to a certain lead point on what we think is the desired flow rate, he'll cue me, and I'll cue you, and we'll go to Manual.
221:58:21|T|LMP|Okay; we're ready at your - Give me a mark.
221:58:26|C|Pet|Okay; stand by. Okay; go to Auto, 16.
221:58:39|T|LMP|Mark. Auto.
222:02:45|C|Pet|Okay; Charlie, the - the valve didn't act the way we thought it was going to. It's been oscillating down and back up on the flow rate, and we were gonna try to catch it in midcycle. And this time, when we went to Auto, it just went up pretty high and it's oscillating a little, but it's staying high. We're gonna watch it for a couple or 3 more minutes, and if it doesn't work, we'll probably have to go down below the couch here and play with the manual valve.
222:03:12|T|LMP|Okay. That'll be the trick of the week in our present configuration.
222:03:19|C|Pet|Well, we can wait awhile for that.
222:03:19|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; at 246 hours, 50 minutes [222:03]. The procedure that we have Charlie Duke, involved in at the moment is attempting to get the proper setting on the mixing valve. This is the valve that controls the amount of the cold water coming back from the radiators - cold water/glycol - that is mixed with the warm water/glycol that has been circulated through the electrical equipment in the cabin, and it's picked up heat from various sources in the spacecraft. By mixing the amount of cold water that is allowed to flow in with the warm water, you're able to maintain the proper cabin temperature. Since very early in the mission it has been known that the mixing valve, which functions in much the same manner as a thermostatically controlled heater valve, has been oscillating more frequently that it would normally oscillate. It has been allowing the flow to increase and then shutting it down and increase and shutting down more rapidly. To get around this we've been having the crew set the level manually at what we think is the proper level for the cabin conditions that are existing at the time. The situation at the moment is that we're attempting to have them reset for changing conditions of the spacecraft to take care of the situation that we now have with the thermal loads and the metabolic heat given off by three crewmen and the situation as we have in this trans-Earth leg of the flight. To do this we had hoped to have the EECOM here in the control center watching the telemetry data. The procedure is to have the crew, in this case Charlie Duke, switch the valve from the manual setting to the automatic setting and watch it cycle. And as it cycled and reached the desired level, Duke would then switch it to manual and it would hold at that point. The problem initially was that the valve was not cycling in auto as we had seen it but it, at last report from EECOM, had started down. And when it reaches the proper level, Charlie Duke will be given the cue to switch to manual and the mixing valve should then hold at that level. And we would hope that that would be a suitable level for the spacecraft during this trans-Earth coast. Apollo 16 at the moment is 166,331 nautical miles from Earth. And the spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 4,094 feet per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; at 246 hours, 50 minutes [222:03].

222:06:21|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. Stand by, and I'll give you a hack when I want you to go Manual.
222:06:26|T|LMP|Okay.
222:06:30|C|Pet|It had started down, but it's hung up again.
222:07:54|C|Pet|Charlie, it looks like it went back up again. We'll give you another little warning here if it starts back down.
222:08:02|T|LMP|All right.
222:09:22|C|Pet|Okay; Charlie, let's try cycling that switch from Auto to Manual and back to Auto, and see if we can get the flow rate to come down.
222:09:33|T|LMP|Okay; here we go. Manual. Auto. Hey, Pete, there's a -
222:09:45|C|Pet|Go to Manual, Charlie. Go to Manual now, Charlie.
222:09:47|T|LMP|- an awful lot of static on the up-link. Could you -
222:09:48|C|Pet|Go to Manual now.
222:09:54|T|LMP|Okay; we got Manual. And there's an awful lot of static on the up-link. Could you check - have network check it?
222:10:01|C|Pet|Roger; will do, Charlie.
222:10:07|T|LMP|Sounds like a wind - wind blowing.
222:10:39|C|Pet|Charlie, on that noise that you're hearing, is - are John and Ken also hearing the same thing?
222:10:47|T|LMP|Yeah, what it is, is John has his comm carrier off but connected, and it - in his PGA, one of the mikes was down in the neck ring, and the - the vent tube was blowing on it. It's okay. It's up here. Thank you.
222:11:02|C|Pet|Okay; we understand.
222:11:04|T|LMP|It sounded exactly like radio - it sounded exactly like the radio static, though.
222:11:09|C|Pet|Okay.
222:11:09|P|PAO|Apparently the situation on the noise that Charlie Duke mentioned - initially reported, was not on the uplink but as you heard him say, an unused microphone in one of the suits. I believe he said in John Young's suit was in a position where it was picking up air flow. Presumably through the suit loop and was in fact putting a noise on their communications loop in the spacecraft that sounded much like wind blowing, which in fact it was.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apparently the situation on the noise that Charlie Duke mentioned - initially reported, was not on the uplink but as you heard him say, an unused microphone in one of the suits.

222:11:45|T|LMP|Pete, we've still got quite a bit of stowage left. If you could keep us advised on the Flight Plan, we'd appreciate it.
222:11:53|C|Pet|Okay. Will do.
222:11:53|P|PAO|Again to reiterate on the procedure that we had Charlie Duke going through to get the mixing valve set at the proper flow rate to keep the cabin temperature adjusted properly. And apparently that procedure worked. Now, what it required was that the mixing valve, in effect, malfunctioned as we have seen it doing in the automatic position where it is cycling rather than holding at a constant level. When we first tried to go through the procedure, the mixing valve refused to cycle in the automatic position, but instead held steady the way it should. However, knowing that this could be a temporary condition [and] that it would again begin cycling at some point, it was still necessary to get it set in the proper position manually. Having Duke cycle the switch from automatic to manual, and back to automatic again. Apparently [this] had the desired effect, and immediately after he did this, the EECOM reported the flow rate again cycling in automatic, and as it dropped through 242 pounds per hour flow rate, we gave the call to Charlie Duke to switch it to manual at that point, at which point it would hold that level in the manual position by the time the message got past from EECOM to Capcom and up to Charlie Duke in the spacecraft, and the switch thrown, the flow rate had gone below 242 to 236, but we consider that to be an adequate flow rate to maintain the kind of cooling that would be desirable at this point in the flight. And from the crew description, they apparently still have some stowing to go through following that EVA. Apparently the suits are not yet stowed, and they'll be doing that prior to their eat and sleep period. Also, at the present time they have the spacecraft SIM bay pointed toward one of the galactic sources of X-rays, using the X-ray fluorescence spectrometry experiment, in an attempt to get some signatures from these various X-ray sources in other galaxies.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Again to reiterate on the procedure that we had Charlie Duke going through to get the mixing valve set at the proper flow rate to keep the cabin temperature adjusted properly.

222:33:43|C|Pet|16, if you read, go Manual and Wide on the High Gain.
222:33:53|T|LMP|Roger. We're with you, Pete. Looks like either our antenna's acting up, or the up-link's been dropped.
222:33:59|C|Pet|Roger.
222:34:05|T|LMP|Do you want me to try Reacquisition?
222:34:08|C|Pet|Let's try Reacq and Wide. And you won't try to step to Narrow. We won't try to step to Narrow.
222:34:20|T|LMP|Okay; the Pitch is osch - oscillating right now between about plus - minus 10 and minus 40.
222:34:32|C|Pet|Okay; let's stay where we are until it settles down, if it will.
222:34:42|T|LMP|Okay; you're in Reacq and Wide.
222:34:44|C|Pet|Roger. Is it oscillating now, Charlie?
222:34:58|T|LMP|Not in Reacq. No, it settled out in minus - about minus 15.
222:35:07|C|Pet|Okay; let's go to Narrow.
222:35:12|T|LMP|Okay.
222:35:23|T|LMP|And it doesn't look like it took, Pete.
222:35:28|C|Pet|Say again?
222:36:03|T|LMP|Okay; Pete, I went to Manual and tweaked up the Pitch a little bit.
222:36:07|T|LMP|And then went to Narrow and Reacq, and it looks like we've got it now.
222:36:14|C|Pet|Okay; looks good to us too now, Charlie.
222:43:13|C|Pet|16, we'd like to Deploy the Gamma Ray to 4 feet, and that's 13 seconds from where you are now.
222:43:23|T|LMP|Okay; in work.
222:43:48|T|LMP|Okay; exactly 13 seconds.
222:43:51|C|Pet|Roger. Thank you.
222:44:33|C|Pet|And, 16, could you give us a battery manifold pressure read-out, please?
222:44:43|T|LMP|You mean the battery compartment?
222:44:46|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
222:44:50|T|LMP|Yeah, it's a- just a minute. It's about - I think it's creeped up to about 2.2 now, Pete. Yeah, it's 2.2.
222:44:57|C|Pet|Okay. Thank you.
222:44:57|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control; at 247 hours, 50 minutes [222:03]. It's been a rather quiet crew for the past 30 or 40 minutes aboard Apollo 16. At the present time they have the spacecraft Scientific Instrument Module bay pointed toward one of the X-ray sources in deep space. And the Principal Investigator for the X-ray fluorescent spectrometry experiment reports that we are getting good counting data on the X-ray source. Later this evening the crew will be aligning the guidance system platform which is used as a stable reference for attitude determination. They also are scheduled to change out one of the lithium hydroxide canisters which removes carbon dioxide from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. A little while ago we had Charlie Duke set the mixing valve which controls the cabin temperature manually in the proper position. And that appears to be doing its job properly at the moment. The crew is scheduled to begin a rest period at 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43], or approximately 11:30 Houston time. And around 12:30 Houston time, INCO - the Instrumentation and Communications Officer here in the Control Center - plans once again to turn on the television camera aboard the Lunar Rover at the Descartes landing site and we'll operate that for about 15 minutes. We'll be receiving the television through the 210-foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California. And again, we'll be pointing the camera by remote control from the Control Center at various rocks and hills around the landing site allowing geologists to get a second look, in this case a third look at these features. The camera was activated last night, and we took a similar pan of the landing site looking at rocks, interesting rocks and interesting features and that will be done again this evening actually early tomorrow morning for about 15 minutes. In the Control Center we now have a clock counting down to entry. That event will occur will occur at 42 hours, 31 minutes from now, with Apollo 16 re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The spacecraft, at this time, is 163,952 nautical miles from Earth and we're watching the velocity increase gradually, and that will be a continuing thing that we will be seeing and as we get closer to entry. The velocity that now is reading about 4,100 feet per second will be up in excess of 36,000 feet per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; at 247 hours, 50 minutes [222:03].

223:17:51|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
223:17:55|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
223:17:59|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. I was just looking through the Flight Plan. We're a little off on the biomed. I'm still on the biomed; Ken and John are off now. They're - stowing suits.
223:18:11|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. And while I've got you on the subject of biomed here, the doctor advises that they were unable to monitor you during the EVA this afternoon; and it looks like you may have to do some troubleshooting on the thing. And you were scheduled to be monitored tonight; however, that's not a hard and fast requirement. They could monitor the CMP tonight instead, and that'd give you a little more time to work with your harness.
223:18:40|T|LMP|Okay. What are they seeing right now?
223:18:42|C|Pet|They're not seeing anything right now.
223:18:48|T|LMP|Ah so. Well, I put some new sensors on this morning before we got suited. When I get my suit off, I'll check it.
223:18:59|C|Pet|Okay.
223:24:24|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
223:24:28|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
223:24:31|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. The biomed doesn't work very well unless you hook it up. When I put on the suit, I forgot to hook it.
223:24:38|C|Pet|Okay, we copy. Okay, Charlie. We'll stick with the nominal plan then. We'll monitor you tonight.
223:24:55|T|LMP|Okay, that's fine. I'll be up in just a little bit.
223:24:58|C|Pet|Okay.
223:26:06|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. We're back up again on the steerable.
223:26:09|C|Pet|Okay. And you're loud and clear.
223:26:14|T|LMP|Okay. And for some reason here - we're sitting in Reacq and Narrow, and I can move the yaw - yaw - plot and - drive the antenna.
223:26:26|C|Pet|Okay, we copy.
223:27:02|C|Pet|Charlie, we're thinking about it. We'll get back to you in a minute.
223:27:07|T|LMP|Okay.
223:28:16|C|Pet|Charlie, apparently the problem is that the position we're in now - we're right at one of the scan limits of the antenna; and when it comes up on that limit, it automatically switches to Manual. And so, intermittently, it would be in a situation where you could drive it.
223:28:33|T|LMP|Ah so. I see. Thank you.
223:43:09|C|Pet|16, we've got a station handover here in about a minute. And because we are on the scan limit on the High Gain, we may lose contact temporarily.
223:57:11|C|Pet|16, Houston. I've got a Verb 49 maneuver for you, and we need a battery -
223:57:17|T|CMP|Understand. A Verb 49 maneuver.
223:57:20|C|Pet|Roger. Coming up at 45 minutes past the hour here - a couple of minutes away, and it's maneuver to 332, 280, 000. High-gain angles are Pitch, 10; Yaw, 260.
223:57:52|T|CMP|Okay, Pete. Verb 49 maneuver. Say the time you want to do it at.
223:57:58|C|Pet|Oh, about a minute from now.
223:58:02|T|CMP|All right. A minute from now. 332, 280, 007.
223:58:08|C|Pet|That's affirmative. It's not real time critical -
223:58:12|T|CMP|And. plus 10 and 260.
223:58:15|C|Pet|That's affirmative. And that maneuver is not time critical.
223:58:23|T|CMP|And - and that's - It's not?
223:58:28|C|Pet|Negative. Just - You can go ahead and do it now, or you can wait a few minutes; whatever you want. And, 16, we'd like another read-out on the battery compartment, too.
223:58:50|T|CMP|It's reading 2.2 - about 5. 2.25.
223:58:56|C|Pet|Roger; 2.25
223:59:50|C|Pet|Omni Delta, 16.
224:01:43|C|Pet|Would you close the X-ray Alpha cover - as soon as you can?
224:05:38|C|Pet|16, you're getting up high on yaw angle. And - want to watch your middle gimbal angle, and you're in Free right now.
224:05:54|T|CDR|Ken is watching it.
224:05:57|C|Pet|Roger.
224:06:11|T|CDR|In fact, he was just flying around it.
224:06:17|C|Pet|Roger.
224:06:17|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Our Flight Plan time is now 248 hours, 54 minutes [224:07], and aboard Apollo 16, the crew is keeping the spacecraft Scientific Instrument Module bay pointed at a galactic target known as Sco X-1. This is a galactic X-ray hot spot source of unusually high X-ray emission, and in order to maintain the proper thermal equilibrium within the spacecraft, actually on the spacecraft surface and for the various equipment located beneath the surface of the CSM, the crew is rotating in such a way that they will change the way the Sun is shining on the vehicle, but at the same time maintain the proper orientation within the SIM Bay so that the alpha - rather the X-ray Spectrometry experiment maintains its proper pointing attitude. As they're going through this maneuver, we're having momentary drop outs in communication, but expect that they will have the High Gain antenna locked up again. In fact, we do now have apparent solid lock-on. In about an hour, the crew will be again aligning the platform of the spacecraft, the stable platform used as an attitude reference. They are then scheduled to have an eat period. They'll be changing out one of the lithium hydroxide canisters; and at about 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43]; beginning an eight-hour rest period. And that will be at, a little after 11:30 Houston time. We presently show Apollo 16 some 161,300 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4,186 feet per second. And the spacecraft has just maneuvered out of antenna lock-on so that we're getting, again, the noise on the communication circuit. And we would expect that to clear up momentarily. Our clock counting down to Entry Interface, the point at which Apollo 16 will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, shows that we're now 41 hours, 27 minutes away from that event.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

224:08:23|C|Pet|Omni Charlie, 16.
224:17:56|C|Pet|16, would you try to bring up the High Gain now on Pitch 10, Yaw 260, and you can follow it up by getting the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Door, Open, and the Gamma Ray, Shield Off.
224:18:11|T|CDR|Roger; understand High Gain, minus 10 and 260 on High Gain.
224:18:18|C|Pet|It's plus 10, 16.
224:18:20|T|CDR|Follow that up by the Gamma Ray - Gamma Ray door - Alpha/X-Ray Door to Open and the Gamma Ray, Shield Off.
224:18:28|C|Pet|Gamma Ray, Shield Off, and that's plus 10 on the High Gain.
224:18:33|T|CDR|Plus 10 on the High Gain.
224:18:36|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
224:18:45|T|CDR|Okay; the door's open and the Shield's Off.
224:18:48|C|Pet|Roger.
224:22:10|C|Pet|16, we need the High Gain, if you can bring it up.
224:22:40|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We're getting it now.
224:22:44|T|LMP|How does that look to you, Houston?
224:22:47|C|Pet|That looks real good.
224:30:33|C|Pet|Okay, 16. We need to go extend - or Deploy on the Gamma Ray for 26 seconds.
224:30:49|T|CDR|Okay; that's in work.
224:30:53|C|Pet|Roger; and we do not want to retract it first; just extend it for 26 seconds from your present position.
224:31:03|T|CDR|Okay.
224:35:36|C|Pet|And, 16, we've got some national and local news here for you while you're finishing up with your chores there. The - first of all, Ken Mattingly made the headlines today in connection with the EVA, and we got a big cartoon here showing the Apollo 16 Intercelestial Hauling Company coming back from the Moon with a big load of rocks. Looks like they've made a - a railroad car out of a SIM bay here and got a big pile of rocks on it there. Moon in the background, and all that sort of thing. Got a couple of things here, one from Vietnam. Communist tanks drove retreating South Vietnamese soldiers toward the provincial capital of Kontum in the Central Highlands today, forcing Government troops to abandon two more artillery bases in the town of Dac To. Seven bases in the Central Highlands have fallen to the Communists since Sunday. Ten waves of B-52s bombed Communist troop positions during the night in an effort to stop the offensive that appeared aimed at Kontum. And from Northern Ireland, some guy found a new use for a baby carriage. He packed it with gelignite, which one of our backroom guys here tells me is a - an explosive, and bombed Northern Ireland's main telephone exchange during the night in a major attempt to disrupt the province's communications. The carriage exploded in a sheet of flames shortly before midnight Monday outside the Belfast Telephone Exchange, injuring two British soldiers and a civilian, and toppling part of the wall of the seven-story brown brick building. And the Astros amazed everybody, I guess, by winning a - their seventh straight today. Chicago's Ron Santo and Houston's Lee May bashed two-run homers for each side in the first inning, and then the two teams battled tenaciously without another score until John Edwards smashed an 11th inning home run that gave the Houston team a 3-to-2 victory. That makes it seven in a row for the Astros, and brought them a first-place tie with Los Angeles in the National League West, and gave them the best nine-game start, that's seven wins and two losses, in the team's 10-year history.
224:38:02|T|CDR|Go get them, Astros.
224:38:06|C|Pet|Okay; got another little thing here in the local paper you might be interested in. Houston paper reports that the city is moving to annex a 50-square-mile area west of Houston, including the Federally-owned Addicks and Barker Reservoirs and the land between them and the present city limits. The annexation reportedly would open the way for the city to develop the reservoir areas for recreational purposes. And I guess that does not - the annexation would not include about 4 square miles of Barker Reservoir in Fort Bend County, which is outside the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. And three US Representatives have studied a feasibility study of deepwater ports in the Gulf of Mexico and have recommended the Texas Coast as a possible site. Texas Representatives Jack Brooks of Beaumont, Bob Eekhardt of Houston, and John Young of Corpus Christi appeared here Monday at a US Corps of Engineer public hearing to voice their opinions on such a facility.
224:39:37|C|Pet|Okay; the weather here is real nice. Houston and vicinity was fair all day and tonight. Becoming partly cloudy Wednesday. Warm afternoons, cool again tonight the paper says. High today was in the upper-80s, low tonight in the upper-50s, and high Wednesday in the mid-80s. And dry, cool air prevailing over most of the US. And of more immediate interest, the weather in the recovery area is excellent and forecast to stay that way.
224:40:16|T|LMP|That's the best news we've heard in a long time.
224:40:21|C|Pet|And we got one final item here I thought you might find interesting. The Memphis Better Business Bureau couldn't help the man who complained that a car dealer refused to refund his $50 downpayment after he decided not to buy the car. Apparently he hadn't told the Better Business Bureau all the facts, because it turns out the dealer suggested he take the car for a test ride and he did, but he was gone three days and put 1,500 miles on the car.
224:40:50|T|CDR|(Laughter) Beautiful.
224:40:56|T|LMP|And then he didn't want to buy it?
224:41:00|C|Pet|He didn't want to buy it, and he wanted his money back, his $50 downpayment.
224:41:05|T|LMP|(Laughter)
224:41:17|C|Pet|You can probably find a lot of flaws with that kind of test procedure.
224:41:22|T|LMP|Yeah, sure could.
224:41:33|T|CDR|How did the TV look down there with Ken outside? I was watching it on the monitor. It seemed like - in places it was too bright, and other places, not bright enough. And I guess that's the way the - I guess that's - unfortunately, that's the way the sunlight is up here.
224:41:50|C|Pet|Yeah, I guess we agree with that, but the pictures were overall real good, John. They looked - looked real good to us. You could see a lot of the detail, and I don't think we missed very much. There were some - some dark areas.
224:42:06|T|CDR|Okay; fine.
224:42:09|T|CMP|I'll tell you, the darkest area, Pete, is looking away from that Sun. Boy, is it black out there.
224:42:14|C|Pet|I bet.
224:42:17|T|CDR|That's time number 47.
224:42:50|T|CDR|I know you guys won't believe this, but after spending 3 days among the rocks, ever so often, when we're sitting around in here, we see a pebble go by. And that's the truth. I don't know what we're gonna do with them.
224:43:06|C|Pet|Just a pebble, huh?
224:43:07|T|CDR|They just seem to - I guess they'll all get collected in ECS. Yeah. When we came back in our suits, it - it got in. I guess we pretty well tracked a lot of dirt into the LM unavoidably, and we weren't able to clean it up. So when we docked, we tried to keep it all in the Lunar Module, but it - this - the inflow valve over here was the only thing that was really working once we got powered down. And then when we went back in there and powered up everything, we took the Command Module hose over with us and that circulated the air. And I think we ended up with quite a few unexpected little pieces of Moon rock in the Command Module.
224:43:47|C|Pet|Roger, understand.
224:43:50|T|CDR|And every time - and every time Charlie sees one float by, he picks it up and changes his story.
224:43:57|C|Pet|He's still analyzing them, huh?
224:44:01|T|CDR|Yeah.
224:44:02|T|LMP|I got it all straight now though, Pete.
224:44:04|C|Pet|Good.
224:44:10|T|LMP|I will be unswayed by the facts when we get back.
224:44:15|C|Pet|Roger, understand. And would you give us Gamma Ray, Shield on, now, please?
224:44:21|T|LMP|Roger.
224:46:02|T|CMP|I tell you, Pete, looking away from - on that EVA, looking away in it out into that blackness, you get the distinct impression that you don't want to let go.
224:46:14|C|Pet|Yeah, I - I can believe that.
224:46:24|C|Pet|Even on TV it looks pretty dark out there.
224:46:31|T|CDR|I - I guess - we're sitting around talking about it here when we had a few slack moments, and one of the things we think is that no matter what you see on the pictures, or what you see on the TV, or what you'll see when we get back with these pictures, you just don't have a feeling of about how stark and brilliant these colors are. Like Descartes was the most dazzling place I believe I've ever been. It just absolutely - brilliant colors that contrast in that bright Sun, and the same way for this EVA that Ken and Charlie just finished. Why it - looking out that hatch it - the black that you can take with a camera is not gonna show up the way that that black actually was.
224:50:03|C|Pet|16, we've got about three more small items. We've got an update to the G&amp;C Checklist, one change to the Flight Plan at 251:45 [226:58], and we need to get John's PRD reading.
224:50:26|T|CDR|Okay; well, I just packed the thing away in the suit locker. If you want me to dig it out, I'll get it, but it's gonna be a job.
224:50:34|C|Pet|Stand by one.
224:50:36|T|CDR|I'm sorry about that, but that thing is just hard to get a hold of and keep a hold of.
224:51:00|C|Pet|Okay; John, I guess we'll try to get to it sometime tomorrow, maybe.
224:51:12|T|CDR|Well, in other words, you tell me that you want me to go in there and dig that thing out, and I don't mind doing it if it's got to be done, but I mean - I can't see I'm getting anymore PRDs than the other two guys.
224:51:35|C|Pet|Stand by, John. We - we're having a little discussion here.
224:51:45|T|CMP|He's been within a couple of counts of me, Pete, during the whole flight.
224:51:52|C|Pet|Roger. While we're waiting, you want to go ahead and get this change in the Flight Plan at 251:45?
224:52:02|T|CMP|Yeah.
224:52:28|T|CMP|Okay, Don. Go ahead.
224:52:30|C|Pet|Okay. At 251:45 [226:58] where it says "Gamma Ray, Retract and then Deploy," we want to strike out the part that says "Retract," and also we want to change the "45 seconds" to "12 seconds." What we're gonna do is just bring it back in from its present position. And we want to make that a "Retract" instead of a "Deploy.
224:52:53|T|CMP|Okay; that's a Retract to 16 feet, and that's 12 seconds from the existing position.
224:52:57|C|Pet|That's affirmative. And also I've got this update on Page G9-4, G&amp;N [sic] Checklist.
224:53:12|T|CDR|Okay, I'll have to - I'm gonna have to unstow that thing to see where we put it.
224:53:17|C|Pet|Okay.
224:53:33|T|CDR|Hey, Don, have you got a pencil out there?
224:53:36|C|Pet|Affirmative.
224:53:39|T|CDR|Okay; we've got a - a Flight Plan update that starts at 249 hours and 39 minutes [224:52]. It's called "Crew Eat Period.
224:53:49|C|Pet|Roger.
224:53:53|T|CDR|Just thought we ought to be able to make some real-time changes from up here too.
224:53:57|C|Pet|Roger. That sounds reasonable. I think we've done our share in the last couple of days.
224:54:03|T|CDR|Yes, I'm sure you'll - you have earned the medals you will receive.
224:54:12|C|Pet|That sounds tragic.
224:52:14|T|CDR|(Laughter) Okay. How about - I got G9-4 here.
224:54:23|C|Pet|Okay. We want to change in column A, line 5 should now read 03753, and line 7 should read -
224:54:40|T|CDR|Okay, that's 03753, line 5 in column A.
224:54:25|C|Pet|That's affirmative. And in column A, line 7, that one should now read 76605.
224:54:56|T|CDR|76605, for column - 7 in column A.
224:55:01|C|Pet|That's affirmative, and that completes that update.
224:55:06|T|CDR|Okay.
224:55:11|C|Pet|And I believe that's everything we got for you.
224:55:15|T|CDR|All righty.
224:55:53|T|CDR|And in line with our 20-plus-hour clock sync, we had to go to day 10, Meal B to catch up.
224:56:07|C|Pet|Say again, John.
224:56:10|T|CDR|And it looks overwhelming.
224:56:17|T|CMP|John says in order to catch up with the clock sync, you're making us eat day 10, meal B, and the task is overwhelming.
224:56:24|C|Pet|Roger; understand. Is that why you scheduled the extra eat period tonight?
224:56:36|T|CDR|Just remember they come in pairs.
224:56:40|C|Pet|Roger.
224:56:41|T|CDR|We missed the one that was supposed to start 3 hours ago, or whenever it was.
224:56:46|C|Pet|Roger. I understand.

After the late landing on the lunar surface and Capcom Don Peterson is now advising the crew that we'll delete the requirement for that radiation dosimeter reading.
224:57:29|C|Pet|16, the decision has been made. We'll leave the suits stowed, and we won't worry about the PRD. And, also, we'd like to advise you that we're now back on the Flight Plan at 250 hours.
224:57:48|T|CDR|Okay; we'll take it.
224:57:51|C|Pet|All righty.
224:57:57|T|CDR|We sure appreciate you helping us. If you could have seen what we were looking at a couple hours ago, you wouldn't believe it. We couldn't - we had so much stuff piled up in here that none of the three of us could see each other, and that's the truth.
224:58:10|C|Pet|Roger.
224:58:12|T|CMP|Which the way we look right now, isn't really such a bad deal.
224:58:16|C|Pet|(Laughter) Roger.
224:58:20|T|LMP|John was reading the checklist, and Ken was down there - we couldn't even see him, and all of us - Every once in a while, a hand would come through this mass of Beta cloth and Mapping Camera cassettes and things, and reach out and grab something.
224:58:35|C|Pet|It's amazing to me you found a place to put it all.
224:58:41|T|CDR|Well, Ken's super well organized on that EVA, boy, I'll tell you. We just got - he's got everything all put away, and we're just about ready for entry.
224:58:50|T|CMP|Well, not quite. We haven't found a place to put all of it, to be honest with you. But we're looking.
224:58:57|C|Pet|Roger.
225:00:05|T|CDR|After 8 days, we finally got organized on this eating. Ken cuts it open, I fill it with water, and Charlie eats it.
225:00:14|C|Pet|Roger.
225:04:34|T|LMP|Hey, Houston, 16. The LMP is on biomed now.
225:04:38|C|Pet|Understand, LMP is on biomed.
225:04:52|C|Pet|And, 16, right now we're not getting a readable signal, but we're gonna run some checks here first.
225:05:01|T|LMP|Okay.
225:07:37|C|Pet|Okay. Charlie, apparently your biomed is still not functioning properly, and the surgeon would like to go to the CMP to monitor for tonight.
225:07:50|T|LMP|Okay.
225:07:57|C|Pet|And, 16, could you give us another reading on the battery compartment?
225:08:09|T|CDR|2.3, Houston.
225:08:11|C|Pet|Roger; 2.3.
225:08:21|T|CDR|Hey, Don, does that mean if I break mine tonight that I don't have to put it on again?
225:08:26|C|Pet|I'm not sure we'd concur with that.
225:08:26|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 250 hours [225:13]. The crew aboard Apollo 16 now apparently getting caught up with their eating. After what they described as a rather involved job of getting piles of material stowed - a job which John Young said they still haven't completed - but they're looking for places to get everything tucked away neatly prior to entry which is now some 40 hours, 23 minutes away. And we also have a clock counting down to the time of splashdown which would be 40 hours, 36 minutes from now. And about 2&frac12; hours from the present time; or at about 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43]; we expect to say goodnight to the crew and get them bedded down for an 8-hour rest period. As they have begun to make headway in getting things stowed away and getting the cabin ship shape again, we find them much more talkative. During the past hour we've gotten a rather picturesque description from all three crewman. They would appear to be in obvious good spirits. You heard a conversation between CapCom Don Peterson and John Young in reference to the PRD, or Personal Radiation Dosimeter. These are radiation meters carried in the suits of each of the crewman measuring their exposure to radiation and Young reported that he had stowed his suit with the radiation dosimeter packed away in the suit because of the problem in getting this instrument out. The fact that his dosimeter had been reading very closely to the readings that we were also getting on Charlie Duke's coupled with the fact that none of the levels have been anything for concern, we've given Young a go ahead to leave the dosimeter stowed where it is. We'll have no further requirement to get a radiation dosimeter reading on him. At the present time, Apollo 16 is 158,668 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is up now to 4,239 feet per second and that just updated to 4,240. At the time of entry, the velocity will reach some 36,196 feet per second. And we're currently showing Entry Interface angle - the angle at which the spacecraft enters the Earth's atmosphere - to be minus 6.6 degrees. The mid-course correction performed at Mid-Course-Correction-5 opportunity earlier in the day brought that flight path angle from something in excess of 7&frac12; degrees down to 6.6, which is getting close to the desired 6.5. And we do have a mid-course correction opportunity, the so-called Mid-Course-Correction-7, which comes shortly before Entry Interface. And at that time, would expect a small correction again to bring the flight path angle down to the desired 6.5 [degrees]. The time of entry is determined by the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. From that point on, the mid-course corrections are targeted to control the Entry Interface angle. This is the angle measured below [the] horizontal and describes the amount of the angle at which the spacecraft is digging into Earth's atmosphere. Any negative number has it entering, a positive number would show that the spacecraft was coming in such a way that it would not re-enter. This Entry Interface angle is set so that the spacecraft comes in at about 6.5 degrees below horizontal. This gives the proper balance between an entry that does not produce excessive g-forces, and one that bites in sharply enough to Earth's atmosphere to assure capture. And that again, that nominal Entry Interface angle is 6.5 degrees. We're currently showing 6.6 which is very close to that desired. About the only activities that we now show on the Flight Plan prior to putting the crew to sleep, are to do a platform alignment, aligning the guidance platform which is used as an attitude reference. We have an activity called contamination control, which primarily involves removing the screens from the environmental control system and cleaning them off. You heard John Young report that there's a fair amount of dirt and debris which is almost inevitable from the amount of dirt brought back on their suits from the lunar surface. And we routinely, during the trans-Earth coast, perform a number of these contamination control operations to minimize the amount of dirt collecting on the screens - the filtration screens of the Environmental Control System. They also will be changing out one of the lithium hydroxide canisters that absorbs carbon dioxide, keeps the anount of carbon dioxide in the cabin atmosphere at acceptable levels. And up through 251 hours, 30 minutes [226:43], the crew is scheduled to have the X-ray fluorescence experiment in the Scientific Instrument Module bay pointed at Sco X-1, the galactic source of X-rays which allows the Principal Investigator to get a calibration, so-called signature, of the X-ray energy admitted by this galactic source.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 250 hours [225:13].

225:27:45|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
225:27:48|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
225:27:54|T|LMP|Roger. Pete - Pete, we're wondering if you could get FAO working and - on the Mars attitude sequence and see if he could come up with one that - during our normal Flight Plan where we got some Sun in the windows, so we could get some interior photography?
225:28:13|C|Pet|Stand by. We'll take a look at it. Okay; FAO says he thinks he can -
225:28:20|T|LMP|I'd appreciate it.
225:28:22|C|Pet|FAO says he thinks he can work that in, and also we need to remind you, I guess, that we need a P52 before you go to bed tonight.
225:28:31|T|LMP|Roger. Just as - soon as John gets out of the kitchen, Ken's gonna give you one.
225:28:37|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
225:34:35|T|CDR|We're just looking at the Flight Plan here, and we just finished Day 10, Meal B, and 10 minutes from now, we got to start on Day 10, Meal C.
225:34:43|C|Pet|Roger; copy.
225:34:53|T|LMP|That was John.
225:34:56|C|Pet|Roger. They said that sounds like some of the flight planning that's been going on down here.
225:35:18|T|LMP|If Alex - Pete, if Alexander the Great had had this kind of chow, he could feed his whole army for two days on what we eat in one meal.
225:54:02|C|Pet|16, we've got the torquing angles. You can go ahead and torque them.
225:54:08|T|CMP|Okay.
226:06:55|T|LMP|Hey, Pete. Will Tony be on before we go to sleep? He said he had some geology questions for us.
226:07:06|C|Pet|Doesn't look like it now. He's scheduled to be here in a couple of hours. Or maybe he might come in a little sooner than that.
226:07:14|T|LMP|Thank you.
226:07:14|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 251 hours [226:13]. Flight Director Don Puddy has just recently completed going around the room checking with all of his Flight Controllers to see if everything appears in good order to put the crew to bed. We plan to do that in about an hour and a half at a Flight Plan time of 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43]. And everything appears to be in good order at this point. The crew is presently completing the Program 52 guidance platform alignment. That will pretty much complete the Flight Plan activities prior to the sleep period. One or two minor activites that they will need to complete, such as changing the lithium hydroxide canister, but they have completed eating and are in pretty good shape to begin their sleep period on schedule. One of the activities that they will be doing prior to beginning the rest period is setting the spacecraft up in the Passive Thermal Control mode. They'll be doing this in a slightly different manner than previously. Normally, the spacecraft is set up with the longitudinal axis at right angles to the Earth-Moon plane. Tonight when they set it up in Passive Thermal Control, the crew will be pitching the spacecraft back slightly from their normal right-angle attitude. This is to allow the instruments in the Scientific Instrument Module bay to continue pointing at the desired targets and still to keep the spacecraft rotating to maintain the proper thermal control. But every rotation it will come up on the proper target. The Command Module Pilot, Ken Mattingly will be wearing the biomedical harness tonight. He'll be the crewman that the flight surgeon will be monitoring heart rate on. That had in the Flight Plan scheduled to - the Flight Plan had scheduled Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke to be wearing the biomedical harness during the sleep period. However, as you heard Duke's biomedical data was erratic and we are getting heart rate on him, but it's not consistant and it's not good solid data.</p> <a name="226_17_14"></a>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 251 hours [226:13].

226:17:14|C|Pet|And, 16; Houston. I've got about five items for you here that'll wind it up for the night, I think. First of all, I'll start out talking about this battery compartment. We've looked at it now, over quite a period of time, and we feel that the pressure rise is due to a very tight cabin battery compartment that prevents any leakage from the compartment to the cabin. And also to the increased battery venting. Now, the - the increased battery venting resulted from recharging the batteries longer than normal. And that in turn resulted from the high discharges during LOI and DOI burns. We really don't feel there's anything wrong with the batteries. In fact, right now, we're looking at a requirement from now until the end of the mission of about 30 amp-hours. And we've got about 100 amp-hours in the batteries right now. We'll continue to check the battery compartment pressure, but we really don't expect to have to vent the compartment or to perform any additional battery charging prior to entry. We'd like to get one more read-out prior to your going to sleep. We'll periodically check tomorrow, but in summary, we feel that there's really not a problem. And the odor that you mentioned is - is probably not from the battery compartment, but is more characteristic of the battery charger.
226:18:42|T|CDR|Okay, Pete. Thank you very much. It makes me feel better to - I was just a little gitchy about recharging, especially Bat B, since - that's where we first experienced that odor. We had not done that previously, and that makes that sound like a pretty good story. And we haven't been monitoring that compartment on the systems test meter very much, so we really can't give you a history of it. But that sounds pretty good to - to me. Thank you. What else?
226:19:17|C|Pet|Okay. We do want to monitor the CMP on the biomed, and I guess we're still showing that you're on the - on the - on the biomed monitoring system right now. Also, your equipment -
226:19:32|T|CDR|That's right.
226:19:39|C|Pet|Also, Charlie, your e -
226:19:41|T|LMP|Go ahead.
226:19:42|C|Pet|- your equipment is apparently still not functioning properly. So we'll need new - a new biomed harness on you, probably for tomorrow night. We need to get that on sometime tomorrow.
226:19:56|T|LMP|Okay, fine. I'll be glad to do that. What - what appears to be wrong with the signal?
226:20:02|C|Pet|Stand by one.
226:20:15|C|Pet|They - they think it's the sensors are probably loose again with maybe some drying of the electrolyte under the sensors, but rather than try to troubleshoot that, they figure it's better just to go to a new harness.
226:20:29|T|LMP|Okay, will do. I just put these on this morning, new, but we'll - we'll - we'll swap out in the morning.
226:20:43|T|CMP|Hey, Don, what film magazines do we have allocated for our little - little - F-equals-MA experiment?
226:20:55|C|Pet|Hang on just a minute. I'll get it for you. Let me give you one more item here while I'm - then I'll get that for you. All right. We'd like to - Right after we go into PTC and get onto the Omnis, we'd like to put the Telcom Group 2 to AC2. The reason for doing that is we just want to return the spacecraft to a nominal configuration because that's the way all our doc - documents and onboard checklists and so on are written.
226:21:28|T|LMP|All right, we'll do that. When we spin up - go on the Omnis - we'll go to Group 2 to AC2.
226:21:34|C|Pet|Roger; thank you. And also, we'd like to get an OPS read-out sometime prior to your going to sleep tonight.
226:21:48|T|LMP|Okay. We gave you one earlier, and it's stowed in A-8 now. And it was 1300 at that time. You want another one?
226:21:59|C|Pet|Roger. I guess we'd like to get one more, Charlie.
226:22:03|T|CDR|That was plenty of time after it had - it was probably at least an hour and a half after it'd had a chance to - to equalize after the blowdown.
226:22:14|C|Pet|Roger. Okay, 16; if it's not readily accessible, that's okay. It's not that big a deal.
226:22:40|T|LMP|Is that all?
226:22:47|C|Pet|That's affirmative, 16. I believe that covers everything.
226:22:52|T|LMP|You know, Pete, on that battery, I took a peek at it every once and awhile during the EVA, and it didn't vent at all into the cabin.
226:23:03|C|Pet|Roger.
226:23:07|T|LMP|My only other question is, why does the - when you vent it to one, why does it climb so rapidly back up to about 16 or so?
226:23:22|C|Pet|Stand by a minute, Charlie. We're thinking about that.
226:23:34|C|Pet|Oh, on the questions on the trying to get some Sun in the windows tomorrow, you'll be in PTC a great deal of the time; and during the - a lot of those PTCs, you will have enough sunlight in the window for interior photography.
226:23:49|T|LMP|Okay, thank you.
226:23:51|T|CMP|Yeah. I just was wondering if one of the other periods might also place the Sun in our window. Because - when you do it PTC, although it comes by very often and you want to photograph a continuous sequence, it kind of chops it up pretty quickly. It takes an awful lot of planning to hit the lighting at the same time you want to do something.
226:24:13|C|Pet|Roger.
226:24:17|T|CMP|But it doesn't justify another attitude or anything like that. This is just so we can get some better pictures inside.
226:24:23|C|Pet|Okay; I'll see what I can do on that, Ken.
226:26:57|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. We've got Magazine 11 that's unscheduled and has CIN film.
226:27:05|T|CMP|Okay, thank you very much.
226:30:51|C|Pet|16, on the sunlight coming in the window in a fixed attitude tomorrow, the - the situation doesn't really look real good. About the best one, I guess, is at one point we'll have the Sun about 40 degrees from the normal to the hatch window and about 20 degrees - that's 40 degrees off in pitch and about 20 degrees off in yaw. So - and that's about the closest we have to having sunlight coming right down normal to any of the windows.
226:31:59|C|Pet|Ken, I think I said that was 40 degrees in pitch and 20 degrees in yaw, and it's actually 40 degrees in pitch and 20 degrees off in roll on that Sun angle -
226:32:14|T|CMP|Hey, Don, I just plugged back in. Would you say again, please?
226:32:17|C|Pet|Okay on this business of getting sunlight in the spacecraft windows, about the best we're gonna be able to do is one attitude gives you sunlight which is - if you take the normal to the hatch window, the Sun is about 40 degrees off of that in pitch and about 20 degrees off in roll. And that's about the closest we're going to have to having sunlight coming directly in a window. Oh, and, Ken -
226:32:41|T|CMP|Okay. Well, we'll do with what we have, then.
226:32:43|C|Pet|Okay; I've just been advised that that's not the hatch window, it's Window 5. And that attitude occurs about 269:30 in the Flight Plan.
226:32:54|T|CMP|Okay; well, we'll - we'll just get all the lights as bright as we can get them, and use the standard interior procedures.
226:33:02|C|Pet|Roger. That sounds like probably a better way to go.
226:33:09|T|CMP|I was just thinking if we had more illumination like that, that we could save ourselves a little time. Be a better pic -
226:33:35|T|CMP|That's a pretty nice, slow ride, Don.
226:33:59|C|Pet|Roger.
226:34:24|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie, are you on the loop?
226:34:31|T|LMP|Roger; go ahead.
226:34:32|C|Pet|Okay, on this battery compartment problem. The reason for it coming back up so rapidly right after you vented is that there is pressure built up in the batteries. And when you vent the compartment, the - the batteries simply then are venting to a very low pressure or see a very low pressure. And they tend to - to vent very rapidly for a while until you get the pressure built back up, and then they vent at a much slower rate.
226:34:59|T|LMP|Okay. Fine. That makes sense. Thank you very much.
226:35:04|C|Pet|Roger.
226:43:22|T|LMP|Houston, 16. We're going through the pre - presleep check - checklist. If you're ready, we'll send you an E-Mod.
226:43:30|C|Pet|Stand by one. Okay, go ahead.
226:45:22|T|LMP|And, Pete, y'all satisfied with our cryo configuration for tonight?
226:45:30|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
226:52:19|T|CMP|Don, do you want us to use standard High Gain procedures tonight?
226:52:25|C|Pet|That's affirmative, 16.
226:52:30|T|CMP|Okay; thank you, sir.
226:57:31|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. The rates look good for a spinup.
226:57:48|T|LMP|Okay.
226:57:51|C|Pet|And, Charlie, we'd like one more reading on the battery compartment.
226:58:11|T|LMP|It's almost about 2.4, Pete, about 2.35, I'd say now.
226:58:18|C|Pet|Okay; 2.35.
226:58:21|T|LMP|Yeah. It seems to have just about stabilized. I should say stabilized. At least the rate of increase is very slow, now.
226:58:32|C|Pet|Roger.
227:08:41|T|LMP|Hey, Pete. Do y'all want a E-memory dump?
227:08:46|C|Pet|Stand by a minute.
227:08:52|T|LMP|Did you say affirmative, Pete?
227:08:54|C|Pet|Stand by just a minute, Charlie.
227:08:58|T|LMP|Okay, and I'm going to AC2 on Telcom Group - AC2.
227:09:02|C|Pet|We' re ready for the memory dump, Charlie.
227:09:22|C|Pet|Charlie, we - we would like to get the memory dump, and we'd like to keep the High Gain until we get that.
227:09:32|T|LMP|Okay. Maybe I'm not up to speed. Do we lose the High Gain if I put Group 2 to AC2?
227:09:41|C|Pet|That's affirmative. That's - that's why I wanted to wait until we're on the Omni to make that switch.
227:09:50|T|LMP|I understand.
227:09:50|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 252 hours, 2 minutes [227:15]. The crew aboard Apollo 16 at the moment getting the spacecraft spun up and its rate of three revolutions per hour; the configuration that they'll leave their spacecraft in during sleep period. And the crew has now completed virtually all pre-sleep activities and they'll be ready to begin their sleep period and looks as if they'll be right on the Flight Plan which calls for them to begin an 8-hour sleep period in about 30 minutes. You've heard several references to the battery compartment pressures. Also earlier on previous shift there was some discussion of a possible battery problem and looking into the situation, we have reached a conclusion that the entry batteries in the Command Module are, in fact, behaving normally. There is no problem. The earlier concern about the possibility of a problem arose from what appears to be excessive venting of the batteries. However, the amount that the batteries vented is related to the amount of charge which of course is also in turn related to the amount of usage on the batteries. These batteries are typically brought on line to supplement the fuel cells during periods of peak usage particularly during the SPS service propulsion system burns where the fuel cells don't react as quickly as a battery will to sudden load demands where the fuel cells would be inclined to react more slowly and perhaps allow the voltage to drop off. The batteries can meet those high demands peak load mode requirements and hold the voltage at the desired level. So prior to an SPS burn for example, batteries are brought on line to supplement the fuel cells. And then the batteries are recharged and to keep them at full charge or nearly full charge for the time that they'll be used during post-entry - after the Service Module is separated. Because of the - some of the problems that were encountered particularly during the descent orbit insertion and also prior to lunar orbit insertion, the batteries got a higher than normal usage which means that they also required higher than normal recharging. Because of the additional recharging and it was decided the batteries were venting and were giving off gaseous products and these were then vented more often than we would normally see. However, it was decided that this was the - to be expected and indicated no problems in the batteries. The crew is instructed to check the battery compartment pressures periodically. The venting at a higher than usual rate is continuing and the battery compartment is then - the pressure built up is relieved by the crew in order to keep pressures from building up beyond the desired limits. And that accounts for the frequent calls you've heard from Capcom to the crew to check the battery compartment pressure levels. And also you heard Charlie Duke report the last time we asked him this question that the pressure rise now appeared to have leveled off and approaching more normal - more normal levels or more normal rise rate. So again we repeat, now we see no problem with the batteries and they appear to be in very good shape for the entry and splashdown. Those events are scheduled to occur; entry at 38 hours 17 minutes, 27 seconds from now; and splashdown 38 hours, 30 minutes, 46 seconds from now. Apollo 16 at the moment is 153,508 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 4,345 feet per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 252 hours, 2 minutes [227:15].

227:15:01|T|LMP|Okay.
227:15:02|C|Pet|And the rates are excellent right now.

227:23:51|C|Pet|Okay. That's fine, Charlie. Thank you.
227:46:07|C|Pet|16, Houston. I've got about three or four more little small items for you here. First of all, we'd like you to verify that you're going to use the OPS to bump the cabin up to 5.7.
227:46:23|T|CMP|Okay, Don. We will.
227:46:25|C|Pet|Okay. And, Ken, you look good on the - on the biomed data. It's all checking out okay. And there's a couple items on the Gamma Ray. We want to Retract for 12 seconds and Gainstep up four steps.
227:46:44|T|CMP|Okay. Retract for 12, and Gainstep up 4. Is that right?
227:46:48|C|Pet|That's affirmative. And let us know before you turn the voice subcarrier down.
227:47:00|T|CMP|Okay.
227:55:16|C|Pet|And, 16, could we get you to tweak the evap out temperature to about 45 degrees? Looks like it's about 38 right now, and that's going to be a little cold after you get into PTC.

235:38:41|C|Eng|Which ones were out?
235:38:46|T|CDR|They're in!
235:39:38|C|Eng|Okay, John, on that High Gain, could we put it to Pitch at minus 40, to Yaw at 90, Reacq, and Narrow?
235:40:04|T|CDR|Okay, that's where we are right now.
235:40:08|C|Eng|Okay, and we understand that no circuit breaker was popped.

235:40:21|C|Eng|Okay, thank you.
235:40:34|C|Eng|And, after you finish your post-sleep up there, before you stop PTC, we'd like to update your checklist or Flight Plan. We've got a couple of changes on the - the PTC initiation, there.

235:41:57|T|CDR|Okay, why don't you just tell me first what the general scheme is, how you're going to do that, while we're getting the book out.
235:42:03|C|Eng|Okay, fine. We'll use you B/D roll, but we'll keep the pitch and yaw jets - D3, D4, C3, and C4 jets - on. And we're gonna leave the roll jets on, too.

235:45:26|T|CMP|You did that.
235:45:27|C|Eng|Oh, good show. Okay, in the G&C Checklist, perform Steps 1 through 4. After the rates are damped in step 5 under the "Auto RCS select," use B/D roll and D3, D4, C3, C4 jets. And you might just sort of write this in at the side - not cross anything out because later on you'll go back to the normal procedure.
235:46:03|T|CMP|Roger; I understand.
235:46:04|C|Eng|Okay, in Step 6, use a minus 0.30 degrees a second, and 3.0 degrees in Noun 79.
235:46:20|T|CMP|Okay.
235:46:21|C|Eng|And delete the last two steps.
235:46:23|T|CMP|As long as we're remaining active, why - as long as we're remaining active, why are we trying to damp the rates, Tony?
235:46:49|C|Eng|Okay, I guess they're not going to let you - they're not going to ask you to damp it down too long. They're just going to get it down to a reasonable rate and then start it up.
235:47:00|C|Eng|Okay, and delete Step 7.
235:47:01|T|CMP|Okay. Roger. I understand.
235:47:10|C|Eng|Okay, and a note here for the PTC attitude at 275 plus 50 [251:03], use the normal PTC procedures. Okay, now we can go to the updating on the Flight Plan.
235:47:28|T|CMP|Okay, what you're really saying is that except for this - these two special things, we're just gonna do what we always do, right?
235:47:36|C|Eng|That's affirmative. I just say it the long way.
235:47:42|T|CDR|All righty.
235:47:44|C|Eng|Okay, from 262 plus 00 [237:13] to 262:20 [237:33], we're gonna schedule in some geology debriefing for EVA-3 for John and Charlie.
235:48:38|T|CMP|Okay; Tony, I got that - it's written down.
235:48:40|C|Eng|Okay, fine. At 264:30 [239:43], change "Purge O<sub>2</sub> Fuel Cell 1" to "O<sub>2</sub> Fuel Cell purge." And then right under that, cancel out all that Mass Spec exercise between 264:35 [239:48] and 264:45 [239:58]. Essentially, all you've done is take all that out and you've done an O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and then ended up with an H<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge.
235:49:23|T|CMP|Okay.
235:49:24|C|Eng|Okay at 267:00 [242:48]-
235:49:30|T|CMP|Go ahead.
235:49:31|C|Eng|Change our - the High Gain Pitch and Yaw to Pitch, 9; Yaw, 257.
235:49:42|T|CMP|Okay.
235:49:43|C|Eng|From 268:10 [243:23] to 268:40 [243:53] - You're gonna love this. Schedule a TV press conference.
235:50:04|T|CMP|You knew we had it stowed, didn't you?
235:50:09|C|Eng|Well, we just waited -
235:50:11|T|CMP|You knew we took two hours to do that yesterday.
235:50:12|C|Eng|- until you had tucked it away.
235:50:14|T|CMP|Okay. Okay.
235:50:18|C|Eng|Okay, at 268:30 [243:43], delete "Charge Bat A.
235:50:34|T|CMP|That's done.
235:50:35|C|Eng|Okay.
235:50:36|T|CMP|Go ahead.
235:50:37|C|Eng|At 269:23 [244:36], delete "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Close; X-Ray, Standby; and Verb 49 maneuver to thermal attitude." Delete that whole block.
235:50:50|T|CMP|Okay.
235:50:53|C|Eng|Okay, delete all activities between 269:55 [245:08] and 270:10 [245:23] - Mass Spec, RCS jet test.
235:51:30|T|CMP|Go ahead, Tony.
235:51:31|C|Eng|Okay, at 270:50 [246:03], change your Verb 49 attitude to 090, 180, 010.
235:51:48|T|CMP|Okay, 090, 180, 010, at 270:50 [246:03].
235:51:52|C|Eng|Okay, and your High Gain attitudes there are Pitch, minus 75; Yaw, 40.
235:52:01|T|CMP|Minus 75 and 40.
235:52:05|C|Eng|And note that your Alpha Particle and X-Ray Cover are Open and X-Ray is On throughout the Skyli - Skylab contamination photos, so you just don't worry about that.
235:52:18|T|CMP|Okay.
235:52:19|C|Eng|At 271:15 [246:28], change your Verb 49 attitudes - 032, 299, 010.
235:52:36|T|CMP|Okay.
235:52:37|C|Eng|And your High Gain: Pitch, minus 40; Yaw, 229.
235:52:45|T|CMP|Okay, minus 40 and 229. And an attitude of 032, 299, and 010.
235:52:51|C|Eng|Okay, at 271:50 [247:03], change the roll in the Verb 49 attitude to 140. And the High Gain is -
235:53:06|T|CMP|From 141 to 140?
235:53:08|C|Eng|- Pitch, minus - Right. And the High Gain's Pitch, minus 47, to Yaw - and Yaw, 59.
235:53:18|T|CMP|Minus 47 and 59.
235:53:20|C|Eng|Roger. At 272:10 [247:23] -
235:53:27|T|CMP|Okay.
235:53:28|C|Eng|Verb 49 attitude, 088, 082, 041, and the High Gain: Pitch, minus 49; and Yaw, 220.
235:53:48|T|CMP|Okay, that's 088, 082 and, 041, and a minus 49 and 220 on the gain.
235:54:02|C|Eng|Roger. At 273 [248:13], delete "X-Ray, On.
235:54:09|T|CMP|Okay.
235:54:11|C|Eng|At 273:30 [248:43], delete "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Open.
235:54:18|T|CMP|Okay.
235:54:19|C|Eng|At 274:15 [249:28], on your Verb 49 attitude -
235:54:25|T|CMP|All right.
235:54:26|C|Eng|New attitude is 164, 134, 035; High Gain is minus 23 and 101.
235:54:42|T|CMP|Okay; 164, 134, 035; minus 23 and 101 at 273.
235:54:50|C|Eng|Okay. And that's all I've got.
235:54:56|T|CMP|Okay.
235:55:00|T|CDR|Oh, shoot, Tony, you can do better than that. Haven't you got any more?
235:55:04|C|Eng|Well, we're - we're - I'm sure FAO will have some here in a few minutes, but that's guaranteed all until you get back.
235:55:12|T|CDR|Oh, okay. Well, good. I don't want to see FAO stopping this quick.
235:55:28|C|Eng|And I guess we don't know why that High Gain hung up while you were asleep. We're going to just continue trying normal procedures.
235:55:39|T|CMP|Okay.

237:16:59|T|CDR|Yeah, we're ready.
237:17:01|C|Eng|Okay. Our first question here on the portable magnetometer - I forgot to re - I forgot to ask you. It was my omission. I was wondering what the temp label on the - on the electronics box read, if you remember.
237:17:21|T|CDR|Tony, you got to be kidding.
237:17:24|C|Eng|I was afraid of that. Okay. And for Charlie there, we'd like to verify that on the third EVA when he was driving out to Station 11 with the polarizer on, that he used nominal camera settings. He didn't allow for the polarizer.
237:17:51|T|LMP|I did just what was on the top of the camera, Tony. Filter - I used 5.6 at 1/250 in the right position.
237:18:01|C|Eng|Okay. That's fine - that's great - That's what we needed to know. Okay. The next question we'll - we'll get when we get the rocks back, but I think - Well, maybe the best way to do this is to describe a theory that's coming up as a result of the rocks you've - that you saw there. It looks as if - or - A possibility is that an older theory that was discarded a few years ago may be the right one, that the Cayley is an outer fluidized ejecta from Imbrium. Fra Mauro would be an inner ring, and then Imbrium sculpture would be outside of that, and then the Cayley would be sort of slosh that filled up all the valleys farther on out. But some of the questions that the geologists are - are pressing here is something that might help them define that. And a lot of it is that they're just - can't wait for the rocks to get back. But anyway, at Station 11, you described some rocks you thought to be tuff. Looking back at Station 5 and 6, after seeing these at 11, do you think you might have seen the same kind of rock there? What we're thinking about is where you described the - the square crystals and the needle-like crystals in clasts. And also, in the same question, were these crystals by themselves or were these - I mean, were the cras - clasts single crystals or were the crystals in clasts?
237:19:38|T|LMP|Recalling Station 11, the - the rocks - that big rock in particular was a two-rock breccia, and - I feel. And within the - within the bluish-black matrix, which made up one clast - one of the rock types - there were needle-like crystals in that. And the white matrix also had crystals in it.
237:20:19|C|Eng|Okay. And how - how does - how did those rocks compare to what you saw at station 5 - 5 and 6?
237:20:40|T|CDR|Tony, I'm afraid I'm not gonna do any better with the answer to these questions than I do on an average field geology trip where you got 10 stations.
237:20:49|C|Eng|Understand.
237:20:50|T|CDR|And the rocks - You know, the rocks that we're picking up at 5 and 6 - that was a long time before Station 11 and -
237:21:00|C|Eng|Understand. Don't - don't worry about it -
237:21:01|T|CDR|And I can't remember what the dang rocks looked like, to be honest with you.
237:21:04|C|Eng|We're gonna have an antenna switch.
237:21:34|C|Eng|Okay. I'll try to stick here to questions that were impressions, and we're going to get the rocks back anyway. I don't - I don't really think there's any point in pressing - pressing with questions where we'll get the answers in a few days. Outbound on EVA-3, you noted one to five-meter craters. And then, 10-meters craters going north and you called them secondaries. We're wondering what evidence there was that - if any, that they came from North Ray. Do you think you saw any secondaries from North Ray? And if so, where would they be? And could you compare them to the size and character of the South Ray secondaries?
237:22:21|T|LMP|There was out - out around Palmetto. There were a couple of craters, if I recall - I don't know - exactly whether it was Palmetto or not, but as you're going out that way, there were some craters with some blocks in them. And that's the reason I called it secondary. They - they were not as fresh - in fact, craters going toward North Ray were a lot more subdued than the craters going down to Stone Mountain. The North Ray had - something had - either they're older or something, but they were a lot more subdued and there was less blocks around. But we did have one or two that had some blocks in them, and that's why I called them secondaries.
237:23:13|C|Eng|Okay. Were the blocks as angular as the ones you described from South Ray?
237:23:23|T|LMP|In general, our impressions were no.
237:23:26|C|Eng|Okay. As you were coming off of - and going up into North Ray area, could you give a guess at the relative proportions of - and the size and shapes of the white and the dark rocks.
237:23:51|C|Eng|In other words, was there a change ra - radially outward from North Ray?
237:24:04|T|CDR|Yeah, this is just an impression, Tony. But I'd say that the - that the dark rock was less prevalent as you went outbound, generally speaking - as you went away from the crater.
237:24:21|C|Eng|Okay.
237:24:22|T|CDR|I could be 100 percent out - wrong on that. But we sure drove over a lot of - in the regolith there in particular. The upper layer in regolith, which contained these - I mean the - the ejecta blanket - which contained - the upper layer in the ejecta blanket contained a lot of boulders with just their heads sticking through, and those were the ones I was looking at because I was trying to go around them. And they - and I don't ever remember seeing a - a dark brecc - breccia-like rock in those boulders.
237:25:01|C|Eng|Okay, sounds good. And that very large rock you sampled up there, Charlie, you mentioned there was white and dark rock in the one rock. Could you describe the contact? Was one contained in the other, or did the contact meander through the whole rock?
237:25:18|T|LMP|Just sort of meandered through, Tony. It was a - it was a - again I'll say a two-rock breccia, where it was a white and the black. And the clasts were very large, up to a meter size. I think the - the predominant rock was black. At least, the overall color gave you a black, but when you looked closely, you could see white clasts in it. So the - and the contact just meandered. I think we've got a couple of close-ups of - of how the contact just meandered through. It was sort of a angular clast in this predominantly blackish matrix.
237:26:03|C|Eng|Okay. The white rock, was it - that was in this big boulder - was it like the white rock that you sampled to the southwest of where you parked the Rover?
237:26:14|T|LMP|Yes, it was all - yes, uh-huh.
237:26:17|C|Eng|Okay. Incidentally, that shadow cone that. you saw on the big boulder - Did it - Did the surface on the cone go right through the clasts, or did the clasts poke out kind of like nodules on the cone?
237:26:35|T|LMP|Well, they - No, it didn't. The shadow cone was in - was fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, in - in the black matrix. And it was - it was a crystalline rock where the shadow cone occurred.
237:26:50|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. Okay. Now that you've seen both North and South Ray ejecta blocks, could you say a few - a little bit about the ray material in the area from the LM to Flag? Do you feel that all that material is characteristic of the bigger ray blocks that you identified near either North Ray or South Ray?
237:27:24|T|CDR|Yeah. I -
237:27:26|C|Eng|Go ahead.
237:27:27|T|CDR|I guess my impression might be that some - at some places, we had some of each and - but most of it was from South Ray. And around the LM, I'm - We saw - Once we got going toward North Ray, those - that material around the LM, by gosh, the breccia - and I collected several of them at that last Station - in hand specimens - some of them were like the material we got out of South Ray, clear of South Ray blanket, and - but several of them were from North Ray. At least, that was my impression.
237:28:14|C|Eng|Okay. Understand, We always had the feeling -
237:28:17|T|CDR|I'd say the most of them for - from South Ray.
237:28:19|C|Eng|Okay. We seem to have the feeling that the rocks you were describing in the LM area were just somehow just a little bit different than what you were picking up either down South or up North. I guess we'll get that all straight when the rocks get home.
237:28:36|T|LMP|Tony, I think that's - that the breccias were different. We've been - Maybe I'm going way out on a limb when I say this, but you - we've been collecting little fragments that have been floating around the cockpit here and looking at them, and they're crystalline - crystalline fragments that - with little white powdery exterior on part of it, and it - chalky appearance. And to me, this is - was characteristic of the rocks - some of the rocks around the Cayley, which - now I'm really leading to a tuff breccia - but the matrix being the ash with these crystalline frags, and the crystalline frags looked just like the rocks - the crystalline rocks around North Ray. At least, the black ones - at least, the couple I found here floating around. Now that's not to say that the fragments are - there are some fragments from whitish rocks, but they were a little bit dif - more difficult to see in this white matrix of what looks like tuff now, because it's very powdery.
237:30:03|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. I wonder if you could describe that - those vesicles in that rock at Station 13.
237:30:15|T|LMP|Well, they looked like - I call them drill holes. Let's see if John has a different word for it.
237:30:37|T|CDR|They look like those pipes that you see in rocks. Like Charlie says, they just look like drill holes.
237:30:48|C|Eng|Okay. Understand -
237:30:49|T|CDR|And they were about a couple of - up to 2 to 3 centimeters across.
237:31:00|C|Eng|Okay -
237:31:01|T|CDR|- in diameter, and perfectly circular. It appeared to me to be.
237:31:04|C|Eng|And how deep did they go? Could you tell - I mean, did they go straight in, or did they seem to meander around?
237:31:12|T|CDR|They seemed to go straight in, and I couldn't tell how deep they were, because they only go in a - They disappear from sight. I didn't try reaching into any of them.
237:31:21|C|Eng|Okay.
237:31:22|T|LMP|Tony, they were - there wasn't anything in them. You could just look in and you'd just - and they looked clean, and - and - just like somebody drilled out the rock.
237:31:34|C|Eng|How about the orientation? Were they all perpendicular to the surface, or did they all have a preferred orientation?
237:31:49|T|LMP|I got the impression that they were parallel to the - to the surface. The rock was - As you stood and faced the rock, you could see - see these little holes sticking out at you that - with most of them parallel to the - to the regolith.
237:32:13|C|Eng|Okay. How about when you went around on the other side? Did they poke out at you there, or were the - What I'm trying to get a feeling is - Did it indicate a top and bottom in the rock, or did it just poke out all over the rock?
237:32:33|T|LMP|I'm - We don't - we only remember seeing them on one side, Tony. And that was the south side or the east side of the rock. The rock was facing - the side we saw them on was away from North Ray.
237:32:46|C|Eng|Okay. Understand.
237:33:09|C|Eng|Okay. And - Stand by.
237:33:51|C|Eng|Okay. Charlie, just before you left the - or during the LM closeout time, you started to make a remark about the change in character between the regolith - between the LM area and Stone Mountain, and somehow we got interrupted there and you didn't finish your statement. I wonder if you could finish what you're going to say - if you happen to remember? Can you characterize the difference in regolith between the LM area and Stone Mountain?
237:34:25|T|LMP|Stand by one on that one.
237:34:27|C|Eng|Okay.
237:35:22|T|LMP|Tony, I think that - We're just sitting here trying to decide - recall, and I - right now the only impression is that you tended to sink in more up on Stone Mountain, which could be down-slope movement of particles, and - It was a - just very loosely consolidated up there. Everywhere you'd - you'd step, you'd sink in a couple of inches. And on the slopes around the LM, it was the same way. And even, in fact, where we landed. Up around the ALSEP site, it was very loosely consolidated, and as you walked you could - your foot would leave quite a imprint. And once we had pretty well turned over the surface around the LM and up on Stone, it would look like freshly raked ground and - to me. Stone Mountain - Smoky Mountain - or excuse me, North Ray, wasn't like that at all. It was very thin regolith and as we commented, we had a tough time raking because it was so rocky right up - within a couple of centimeters, at the top of the regolith. Over.
237:36:47|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. I think your down-slope movement there on Stone was probably - probably right. Although that wouldn't explain why it was harder at 5 and 6 than at 4. Well, anyway. Next question here - On that half-orange-sized rock that you put on the LPM, wonder if you could estimate - estimate how common that type rock was around.
237:37:22|||<p class="tech"><b>237 37 22 Duke:</b> Well, John picked up one just like it up on - It was a grab sample up on Sto - yes, Stone Mountain. And it was one of the crystalline rocks with that sugary crystalline texture to it.    <p class="obcm"><b>237 37 38 Young (onboard):</b> Like whitish rock?
237:37:42|T|LMP|Huh? Yeah. And it was one of those whitish rocks that was a little dusty. I think that - I think it's fairly common. We'll just have to see when we get the samples back, but it was my impression it was one of the three predominant rock types there.
237:37:56|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. And the soil at Station 8 - was it white underneath the top surface like you described up at Station 4 and a lot of other stations?
237:38:27|T|CDR|We kicked - we kicked some of that, and I - I can't remember whether it was or not at Station 8.
237:38:36|C|Eng|Okay.
237:38:37|T|CDR|I think it - Anyway, we sampled the soil sample there, and it's in the - it's in - it's in the box somewhere. But I can't - I certainly can't remember whether it was a - white underneath or not.
237:38:51|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. And just subjectively, could you compare - now that you've been up fairly close to Smoky and on Stone - could you compare the two - two structures?
237:39:09|T|CDR|They looked the same to us.
237:39:13|C|Eng|Okay. Well, that's all of the geology -
237:39:15|T|CDR|I - Okay, I wouldn't be surprised but what they aren't the same. When Ken and I and Charlie looked at it in this real low Sun angle, I - I guess that's - As far as geometric form, it certainly looked - it was the hummocky material from the Descartes region is the way it looked. Right across Smoky - right through that whole region, it looked like a single unit, and - and I guess that would be my interpretation of it at this point. But it's pure speculation, but I would guess that tonight. I wouldn't be surprised but that we don't find a lot of these rock types on one region very close to another region being about the same.
237:40:08|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. The reason -
237:40:13|C|Eng|Go ahead, Charlie.
237:40:14|T|LMP|- to add to that, I was just - I had the same impression. Looking at the - the South Ray, with the black and white streaks up the wall - up on the interior of the crater, and also at Baby Ray, being very stark in contrast. And then in North Ray, having that same impression but more subdued. And the rocks appearing to be very similar - I think there's a good lateral - and you guys can demolish this when you analyze the rocks, but right now my impression is that - the - the two craters penetrated are very similar - or two very similar rock units. The white and the bluish black.
237:41:11|C|Eng|Okay. Understand. The reason for a lot of these questions - and we know the answers are in the rock boxes and bags there and we'll all get when you get home. But there's a lot of interest since the model - the model that we have of the whole area is being changed because of the high aluminum to silicon ratios and because of all of your rock descriptions there. And everybody's - Well, we switched antennas there. There's a lot of push here to reformulate a new model. The press is kind of pushing, and you'll probably get some questions this afternoon in your press conference. I was wondering if there's anything you wanted to ask the geology team about this - this new model, since I don't think you've ever been briefed on it.
237:42:09|T|LMP|No, I'd sure never heard it was slosh from the Imbrium at the Cayley.
237:42:14|T|CDR|I'd say it's premature to be making those kind of statements, Tony. And I would like to wait until we get all that data in and take a look at it. It's just too soon to be on - on hearsay and - and - and not having the real evidence and not having the - all the data analyzed. It's too soon to be making any major conclusions about the region. It's just - I can't see how you could do that.
237:42:38|C|Eng|I sure agree with you, John. But, you know, everybody's - Everybody's excited and trying to press with it. But, anyway, I thought you might want to - to hear a little bit about that, if you're going to be asked on it this afternoon. That isn't - Now, of course, that isn't to say anyone's saying that Kant Plateau or Descartes Highlands are slosh. It's just the Cayley part. Anyway, that's all - that's all we have here, if you just want to press on there.
237:43:11|T|CDR|No, I just don't see how you can come to that conclusion this quick without any evidence, Tony. It's - It'd be nice to do that, but I - boy, I would - I would not press for that sort of thing this early in the game. And I wouldn't answer questions to anybody to amount to anything on that kind of stuff because that's too speculative.
237:43:30|C|Eng|Okay.
237:43:31|T|CDR|In other words, it ain't good - it ain't good science.
237:43:35|C|Eng|Yeah, John. I think - I think you're right on, and I hope they heard you in the backroom, because I - I think I said the same thing this morning.
237:43:59|C|Eng|And we have a slight change to the Flight Plan at 264:10. We'd like to change the Noun 79 deadband to 2 degrees.
237:44:18|T|CMP|Okay. The Noun 79 changed to 2 degrees at 264:10.
237:44:24|C|Eng|Roger. And I'll see y'all tonight. I'll come back and tuck you in.
237:44:32|T|CMP|Okay, Tony. Thank you.

237:48:25|C|Har|Good morning. Like to give you a little change here - or an addition, I guess, at 264:50 [240:03] - waste water dump. Says there we're supposed to specify the percentage and that's 35 percent. However, we'd like to call the start and stop - start and stop of that maneuver. EECOM would like something to do this morning.
237:48:52|T|CMP|Okay. You going to put us in attitude and do a midcourse correction with it?
237:49:02|C|Har|I don't guess we need that -
237:29:04|T|LMP|Tell EECOM we got some - Hey, Henry. Tell EECOM we got some good pictures of a dump when we were station-keeping up there while y'all were deciding whether we could land. Ken did his dump, and we had perfect lighting for it and so we got some DAC film of it and it was really coming out of there.

238:01:00|C|Har|We got an antenna switch coming.
238:01:54|C|Har|Ken, I haven't gotten a real satisfactory answer on this. Apparently, this is for the Photolab. They just kind of want to got - get an idea of your usage. But the way it looks to me, I wouldn't - I wouldn't do anything special, unless you got it written down there somewhere.
238:02:10|T|CDR|Okay, Henry. You can tell the Photolab that they're in real trouble, because they're going to be developing film for a long time.
238:02:22|C|Har|Okay.
238:02:41|T|CMP|Most of the 70s are - are - are already exposed, with maybe like 10 frames remaining on each or something. And the 16s, I don't really know what their status is.

239:01:11|C|Har|Roger. Copy.
239:02:34|T|LMP|Mark. Faint white dot on the left eye, lower inboard - Duke.
239:06:28|T|LMP|Mark. Duke - lower right eye - a faint, fuzzy flash.
239:06:43|T|CDR|Mark. Young - left eye - a streak going from top to 'bottom in the - in the outboard part of the left eye.
239:07:18|T|LMP|Mark. Duke - right eye, lower center - a bright dot.
239:08:43|T|LMP|Mark. Bright dot - upper right eye - Duke.
239:09:01|T|LMP|Mark. Left eye - bright dot - Duke - outboard.
239:10:07|T|LMP|Mark. Duke - a fuzzy flash in the upper left eye, simultaneously with a bright dot in the right eye.
239:11:28|T|LMP|Mark. Upper left eye - little faint dot. That was Duke.
239:14:20|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We show your ALFMED period up.
239:14:27|T|CMP|Okay.
239:14:42|C|Har|And, 16, when you get ready to maneuver to this new attitude, if you don't have Bravo 1 enabled, your present jet configuration is okay.
239:14:56|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. I'll check it.
239:15:06|T|CDR|That new attitude I went to was great, Hank. I almost went to sleep.
239:15:11|C|Har|Roger. And I gather that ALFMED must be a pretty effective shield. I didn't hear Ken saying anything.
239:15:21|T|CDR|He wasn't supposed to use it.
239:15:25|T|LMP|We already did that on the outbound leg.
239:15:27|C|Har|Oh, okay.
239:15:32|T|LMP|He was doing something, but it was all audible.
239:17:11|T|CMP|Hank, what was the jet you wanted to have me turn off?
239:17:14|||<p class="tech"><b>239 17 14 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Bravo 1, so it won't fire in the SIM bay.    <p class="obcm"><b>239 17 17 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Bravo 1.
239:17:18|C|Har|- If you used Bravo 2 and Delta 1 for roll, you'll be okay just to leave that configuration and maneuver on to the next attitude.
239:17:36|T|CMP|You want to use Bravo 2 and Delta 1. Is that affirmative?
239:17:41|C|Har|That's affirmative.
239:18:02|T|CMP|Okay, Hank. They - that's not the jet configuration they gave us this morning because I did have the SIM bay jets - No, I'll have to look up those jets I had this morning, but Bravo 1 was one of the ones I had turned on.
239:18:23|C|Har|Roger. We understand that, Ken. The reason is that when we stop the PTC the - we're - in the configuration you had, you'd probably use - you'd have to use Bravo 1 to stop it, and it would fire into the SIM bay. It probably never fired during the PTC.
239:18:44|T|CMP|Okay.
239:21:42|T|CMP|Hank, this one you want to do is a normal PTC? Or do you want to use this one as a - as the enabled jet version.
239:21:53|C|Har|Roger, Ken. We'd like to do it in that same procedure that - that Tony read to you this morning. And, for the next one at about 275:50, we'll go back to the regular procedures.
239:22:07|T|CMP|Okay. And you want to use the same jets that Tony read me this morning?
239:22:10|C|Har|Roger. And those, I guess, should be the ones you have enabled now.
239:22:20|T|CMP|Except I got - this morning I had all B/D Rolls enabled.
239:22:26|C|Har|Okay, we'd like to start up in single jet, which is what you have now.
239:22:38|T|CMP|Okay. I'll use the jet configuration I have now, then.
239:22:42|C|Har|Roger. And, I guess - did Tony read you the change that we wanted the 2-degree dead band?
239:22:49|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
239:22:50|C|Har|Okay.
239:22:52|T|CMP|And how about the rate? Now, he read me 0.3 this morning, and normally we do 0.42. I take it 0.3 is what you're really after.
239:23:03|C|Har|Let me double-check that one.
239:23:15|C|Har|Okay, 0.3 is the correct rate.
239:23:20|T|CMP|Okay.
239:23:34|C|Har|And, Ken, when we get to attitude, we'd just like to hold that before you start the P20, so we can dump the tape recorder.
239:23:42|T|CMP|Okay.

239:27:19|C|Har|Ken, we need to get the High Gain, and I guess we need you to do a Manual Roll about 30 degrees left.
239:27:29|T|CMP|Okay.
239:27:41|C|Har|And, in regard to the urine dump coming up, the doctors think they see a correlation between the urine dump times and the dump port temperature. So, just to see if this really works, and if it does work, we may be able to get rid of all of this recording stuff. We'd like for you to identify which bags you are dumping and give us a mark at start and the end of the dump.
239:28:10|T|CMP|Run that by one more time, please?
239:28:13|T|CDR|Looks like you guys don't understand the problem, do you? I can't believe that. We all dumped the urine into the same bag.
239:28:24|C|Har|Okay, give us a start and stop.
239:28:26|T|CDR|We been stowing - yeah, but, Hank, we're all dumping into the same big white bag and then that gets dumped over to the side. Is that what you want? A total volume from all three of us?
239:29:17|T|CDR|Did you get my last, Henry?
239:29:20|C|Har|Roger. They still would like to know the start and stop times.
239:29:27|T|CMP|(Laughter) Be our guest.
239:29:29|T|CDR|What do you - start and stop of what? You know, we let this thing purge, line out, and then we let it sit there until we're sure everything's all cleaned out - afterwards, to make sure we don't plug things up. I guess we can tell you when we do each step, but we don't really know when those bags are empty.
239:29:44|C|Har|Well, that would be my guess, also, but can you guess at it? Okay, if you can't, forget it.
239:29:55|T|CDR|Okay.
239:30:24|T|CDR|Okay, Henry. Here's what we've been doing with the urine.
239:30:50|T|CDR|Is this attitude okay for you, Hank?
239:30:56|C|Har|Roger.
239:31:03|C|Har|John, could you repeat what you said. INCO cut the antenna off about the time you started?
239:31:25|T|CDR|Houston, is this attitude okay for the High Gain?
239:31:27|C|Har|That's affirmative. It's a good attitude.
239:31:32|T|CDR|Okay, now. Let me tell you what we've been doing with this stuff. We've been using the Gemini [?] bags and then dumping it into a big white bag. And it's all in there now, all mixed together, and nobody knows whose is whom's. And - and, furthermore, we don't know when we dump that big white bag when - We know when we start to do it, but we don't know whenever it finishes. Because you can't see the inside of the bag. You just don't have a feel for that. So, what you just do is you just let it run until you think you ought to quit and look and see if you've got particles on the outside. And even after you quit, there's still particles on the outside.
239:32:13|C|Har|Roger. Copy, John. Why don't we forget about that?
239:32:21|T|CDR|Okay. I would be glad to do it, if I thought it would give you any data. But I can't see how it'll give you anything you could use.
239:32:30|C|Har|Okay, John. What we're trying to do is find some way to make the procedures a little cleaner on - on Apollo 17. So they think they can get some useful data out of this, and if you can just give us a mark when you start, maybe they, from the temperature curves, can tell just about when it ends. They got a - they're trying to get a calibration on how the temperature of the port changes during the dump.
239:33:01|T|CDR|Yeah, but - are you sure that, for example, that we don't have at least thousands of chamber dumps that'll tell you the same thing?
239:33:22|C|Har|Okay. They said the chamber data is what got them looking at the possibility of doing this.
239:33:29|T|CDR|Okay, Hank, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll give you mark when we start and a mark when we stop.
239:33:36|C|Har|Thank you.
239:35:44|T|CDR|Purge line heater, Houston - on, Houston.
239:35:48|C|Har|Roger; copy.
239:41:03|C|Har|16, Houston. When you get ready to dump the waste water, we'd like to dump to 49 percent. That'll leave us enough for the Skylab contamination.
239:41:22|T|CMP|Okay, dump to 49 percent.
239:41:41|C|Har|16, Houston. We can go ahead and start spinning up, but first we've got to load the Verb 49 with a current roll attitude and Pro going to attitude and then start the spinup. And for the spinup, we'd like to use Delta 2 in addition to the jets you now have configured so we can get a couple of spinups, and then turn Delta 2 back off.
239:42:07|T|CMP|Okay, we add Delta 2 for the start and then turn it off.
239:42:11|C|Har|That's affirmative.

239:52:59|C|Har|Ken, I guess you've figured out the reason we got caught there is we can't load the Noun 79 in Option 2.
239:53:10|T|CMP|Yeah, I just figured that out, Hank. Is what I did there to fix it okay?
239:53:21|C|Har|Okay, you restarted it after going to Accel Command, is that right?
239:53:28|T|CMP|Yeah, I restarted it, then didn't mean to stop it, just kind of kept it going. Is that attitude looking all right or - I don't have any way of reading out where the dead band is centered now. Would you like for me to just stop and start all over again?
239:53:42|C|Har|Okay, we'll take a look at it.
239:54:04|C|Har|Okay, the - the center's only about a half a degree off from where we wanted it. So that's good.

240:02:16|C|Har|Okay.
240:02:18|T|CDR|That ain't good enough from past experience, is what you're saying?
240:02:22|C|Har|I'm not saying that at all, John; just thought I would help if I could.
240:02:26|T|CDR|Okay. You are, Hank. I'm just teasing.
240:02:50|T|CDR|Looks like 49 to us.

240:03:03|C|Har|Mark; 50 percent.
240:03:11|T|CDR|Okay, she's shut down.
240:06:30|T|CDR|Hank, we're gonna start, and we're gonna give you something in a little bag first, and I'll give a mark when we start it and when we stop it and when I see particles start to slow down, and then we'll go emptying the bigger bag.

240:07:36|T|CDR|Okay, the particles are starting to slow down, but they spurt every now and then. Man, there's a big blast.
240:08:13|C|Har|Ken, do you have an estimate of the quantity in the little bag?
240:08:22|T|CDR|No, there's no way to get that (laughter).
240:08:25|T|CMP|You're supposed to give us that.
240:08:26|T|CDR|That's what you're doing. You're supposed to tell us that (laughter).

240:08:38|C|Har|Roger (laughter).
240:08:48|T|CDR|Okay, we've got the bag off. We're getting ready to start another one, and most of the particles have stopped.
240:09:23|T|CDR|Okay, we're running another bag.
240:09:53|T|CDR|Okay, that bag's empty.

240:12:56|T|CMP|Okay, we're starting on our big bag.
240:12:59|C|Har|Roger.
240:13:06|T|CDR|And it's dumping now.
240:13:07|T|CMP|Okay.
240:14:30|T|CMP|Well, it looks like our big bag is empty somewhere in here.
240:14:36|C|Har|Roger. Copy, Ken.
240:15:46|T|CDR|You know, Houston, we think one of the problems you're gonna have with this kind of a - a measuring thing is how - how clogged up your filters are. Like we don't think it's dumping as much right now as it was when it started because we think the filter's getting clogged.
240:16:07|C|Har|That's a good point, John.
240:16:29|C|Har|We also see that if we're gonna do sequential dumping, we're gonna have to wait between the dumps, you know, to allow the nozzle - the temperature to stabilize.
240:16:40|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
240:17:15|T|CDR|We're gonna turn the dump valve off and change filters.

240:23:59|C|Har|Roger, understand. Stand by.
240:24:03|T|CDR|Okay, the eight ball didn't move. That's the ICDU ("a CDU" in CM transcript) fail light is what it is.
240:24:12|C|Har|Okay, just stand by. We're looking at it.

240:24:23|T|CDR|Yeah, - is okay.
240:24:41|T|CDR|Okay, no switches were being touched at the time.

240:25:25|T|CDR|ICDU ("A CDU"?) fail(ed?) transient, huh?
240:25:41|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We'd like for you to go through mal procedure G&N, Number 6 on page 28.
240:28:56|T|CMP|Okay, stand by.
240:33:27|T|CMP|Okay, Hank, when we go into number 6 procedure, we come down, and the logical answer out of Block 2 is that the - you can reset the program lights and the ISS light goes off all on its own. It's only on for a very short period of time. And that says that it's a transient condition and stops. I -- guess we could take a look at going down through the "No" path and try Block 6, but I'd like to have some concurrence on that before we do it.
240:34:02|C|Har|We concur - like for you to go to block 6.
240:34:10|T|CMP|You had some bad comm there; I understand you want us to go to Block 6.
240:34:12|C|Har|That is affirmative.
240:34:16|T|CMP|Okay.
240:34:33|T|CMP|Okay. Before we started on that, we've decided to take a look at 16 20 and it seems to be counting in all three axes. And they agree with what's on the FDAI. We're gonna start into Block 40 now. And I'm going on the Vox so I can talk and read at the same time.
240:34:58|C|Har|Roger, Ken. Before you do this, would you check yaw real carefully. We're showing about a degree difference between the ISS att and the ICDUs.
240:35:09|T|CMP|Say again, Hank. You - you were blocked out right in the middle.
240:35:11|C|Har|Roger. Could you check the yaw axis real closely; we're showing about a degree difference down here. The other two axes look pretty good.
240:35:21|T|CMP|I - I repeat, the FDAI and the Noun 20s look like they're in as close agreement as I can read. You can't tell a degree on the FDAI down here anyway. (last sentence is Young in the CM transcript]
240:35:32|C|Har|Roger.
240:35:33|T|CMP|There's that much dispersion in the instrumentation. You know that. Okay; can we proceed?
240:35:45|C|Har|Proceed.
240:35:50|T|CMP|Okay, we did. And it's counting again, and it's gone back to the same numbers - well, it just blanked again. Let's see here; maybe I was premature.
240:36:15|T|CMP|That's where it zeroed. Yeah, it's still showing about the same numbers, Hank. The biggest change was in the - no they're all - they're all ball park, within readability, from one reading to the other.
240:36:36|C|Har|Roger.
240:36:38|T|CMP|Okay. So out of that, I come up with a "yes" answer, and I'm going - looking at block 12.
240:37:23|T|CMP|I guess in order to do this block 12, I have to be in CMC Control, is that not correct?
240:37:32|C|Har|Stand by. SCS should be okay, Ken.
240:37:45|T|CMP|Okay. I had no displacement; I did a Verb 43 Enter, and I loaded R-1, 2, and 3 - and I got no needle displacement. Is another Enter required or something?
240:38:06|C|Har|Stand by.
240:38:24|C|Har|Ken, we'd like for you to repeat the procedure, starting with the Verb 43, and do it very slowly so we can watch it down here.
240:38:33|T|CMP|Okay; there's Verb 43 - Enter, plus 00250 Enter, plus 00333 Enter, plus 00333 Enter, and the needles pulsed out and right back to zero.
240:39:12|C|Har|Roger. Copy. The needles did jiggle, but they went back to zero.
240:39:23|T|CMP|That's correct.

In the meantime, it looks like we're safe to proceed with the Flight Plan. We'd like to pick it up at 267 - go into this Sco X-1 attitude. And, since we're real fat on RCS fuel, we'd like to do the maneuvers between these different attitudes today where we're getting data in different - different attitude at a faster rate, a half degree per second. And if that's all right with you, then, we'll get the X-ray on now which is called for in the Flight Plan and then start maneuver into the Sco X attitude and I guess we can use CMC for that.
242:01:09|T|CMP|Okay, I'll - I concur with using the CMC and do you have any feel for midcourse 7?
242:01:27|C|Har|I'll get an answer on that, Ken. Right now, it's looking like about 3 feet per second, Ken.

242:18:44|T|CMP|Hello, Henry.
242:18:46|C|Har|Hello, there. We got something we'd like to try here, and its purpose is to determine whether or not the time delay on the CDU fail detection circuitry is so short that - apparently normal CDU movements can trigger the alarm. Now the normal time delay is 2 to 10 seconds. And we got a procedure here we'd like for you to run and time - time this thing, and see if that might be our culprit.
242:19:20|T|CMP|Okay. Read it to me.
242:19:22|C|Har|Okay. We'd like for you to go the SCS control, Min, Low, and uncage BMAG so we can hold this attitude pretty close. Then we'll do a Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 12 Enter, 20 Enter, 1 Enter, and when you Enter on the 1, we want you to start your stopwatch, and as accurately as possible, get the time from the Enter until you get to ISS warning light. And after you get -
242:20:04|T|CMP|Okay. So this channel 12 is gonna - is setting the bit that is the ISS warning bit that comes from the hardware, and the computer is the thing that does the timing. Is that correct?
242:20:15|C|Har|What that's doing is zeroing the CDUs. And that - that guarantees you a fail. Okay, and as - as soon as you get the accurate time on that, we'll do a - a Verb 40 Enter, and wait 10 seconds for the CDUs to recover.
242:20:45|T|CMP|Okay. I'll do that, and then I'll call the steps out as I go through it.
242:20:49|C|Har|Roger. And be advised that the CMC DAP is inoperative between the time you set the bit and the time you do the Verb 40.
242:21:00|T|CMP|Also for 10 seconds thereafter.
242:21:03|C|Har|Roger.
242:21:13|T|CMP|Okay, we're in SCS. Deadband Min, the Rate's Low, limit cycles On, we've got the BMAGs uncaged. You're watching this too, John?
242:21:31|C|Har|Okay, we're looking down here.
242:21:36|T|CMP|All set. There's Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 12 Enter, 20 Enter, 1 - Is it Noun? I am Enter, Reset. Okay. Here we go; 5, 4, 3, 2, Enter. I got 5 seconds.
242:22:12|C|Har|Roger. That's a normal indication. That eliminates that as a possible source, so you can go ahead and do your Verb 40 and recover and go back to CMC control.

243:24:24|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston. We're about ready to go here. You want to try to bring up the TV?
243:24:31|T|CDR|Okay; it's in work.
243:24:57|C|Har|Okay. We've got a picture now.
243:25:03|T|LMP|Super! How does it look?
243:25:07|C|Har|Looks pretty good.
243:25:08|T|CDR|How does everything look to you?
243:25:18|C|Har|Other than the fact you're looking pretty woolly now, that's not bad.
243:25:25|T|LMP|(Laughter) Keeps you warm.
243:25:30|C|Har|Apollo 16, the questions in this press conference have been prepared by newsmen covering the flight here at the Manned Spacecraft Center. I'm going to read them to you exactly as worded by the newsmen and in a priority specified by them. Question number 1 for John Young: A couple of times you were on hot mike and didn't know it, but how could a nice Florida boy like you say what you did about citrus fruit?
243:26:03|T|CDR|That's a very good question. Wait'll you drink it day and night for 2 weeks, and - and let me know what you think. And for lunch, too.
243:26:15|C|Har|Question number 2 -
243:26:16|T|CDR|I - I have an orange grove - I have an orange grove down in Florida, too, so I do like citrus, but citrus drinks are something else.
243:26:32|C|Har|Question 2: When the CSM circularization burn could not be performed on schedule, did you think you wouldn't be able to land on the Moon?
243:26:47|T|CDR|I thought - we all had serious doubts about whether we're going to be able to do it or not. Right?
243:26:56|C|Har|Question number 3 in three parts. Were you surprised at the rocks and other formations at the Cayley site?
243:27:10|T|LMP|I think we were. The - the original impression had been mostly volcanics to look for, and I don't think we found the - the highest percentage of volcanics as we had originally anticipated. So the rocks that we found were unique, that we had never seen before in any of the lunar samples, we feel, and so it was a surprise.
243:27:39|C|Har|Do you think your geological training properly prepared you to describe them?
243:27:50|T|CDR|I think so, under the circumstances. You see, most of the rocks are - were dust covered apparently by the - by the two impacts, North Ray and South Ray. It had just thrown a big blanket of dust out across there, and we saw very few rocks that were clean un - until we cut into them. And you don't want to take too much time to stop and whack off a piece of rock, because it's pretty hard to do in a pressure suit. So we were just describing them more by shape and softness and friability and things like that. And that really doesn't take a lot of training, but I think we've had adequate training to do this kind of a job.
243:28:40|C|Har|Did you see anything specifically volcanic?
243:28:50|T|LMP|As far as craters go, Hank, we think we saw two that had the shape we called endogenic that had the shape of very subdued old cinder cones or something of that nature. They were - In other words, they were - look more like, well, sink holes, really, with the surrounding topography. They had no rim on them; and, to us, it looked like it might have been a source for some - volcanic activity way, way back.
243:29:27|C|Har|Question 4: Several times at North Ray you mentioned, "Don't get too close to the edge." Did you think that if you had fallen in, you wouldn't have been able to get out?
243:29:39|T|CDR|That's affirmative.
243:29:43|T|LMP|(Laughter) Yeah. You bet.
243:29:44|T|CDR|If we had fallen in we would not have been able to get out. That's correct.
243:29:50|C|Har|Question 5: The heat flow experiment you broke was successfully fixed in simulation, although it was complicated and took a great deal of time. Do you think you should have tried to fix it or do what you did?
243:30:07|T|CDR|I don't think we're qualified to make that decision. It was made by people on the ground that are far more qualified to do that sort of thing than we are. If - if we had been told to do that, we would have certainly done it.
243:30:23|C|Har|Would you like to have been informed of the successful sinta - simulation and the trade-off factors involved?
243:30:31|T|CDR|I - I still don't think that that's our decision making process up there on the surface.
243:30:40|C|Har|Question 6: You've had a lot of equipment trouble during this mission. Is there a common thread running through all these problems for which you could suggest an explanation?
243:30:56|T|CMP|Yeah. I think space flight's kind of complicated. You got a lot of sophisticated equipment here that you're trying to get all working at one time. I think that's what we built a redundancy in for, and it seems to be paying off quite well.
243:31:12|T|CDR|Yeah. I don't - I don't think there's any relation between any of these failures, one to another. I - I don't think there's any common thread. I agree with Ken. It's very complicated gear. It has to run for long periods of time, and you've got to expect some times that it won't run, and you got to know how to fix it, and that's why they send us on these trips.
243:31:37|C|Har|Question 7 for Ken: Your observations of the landing site. Did you see the Lunar Module or the Rover, and did you see any differences between Cayley and Descartes?
243:31:51|T|CMP|Okay. That's two distinct questions. First thing, did I see it? We never pointed the sextant at the landing site according to the Flight Plan because of the alterations we had. And there were two occasions, once when I thought I caught a glint of light, which I could not recognize as the LM but which came from the location where I think the LM probably was sitting. And that was very close to the position on my map that you folks read up to me. And once, as Rover was starting up on Stone Mountain, I just happened to be looking as they went by, and I think you were on the shift, Hank, and told me that they were hitting Stone Mountain, and I looked over there, and about that time I got another little flash of light, which is about all, with the 10-power optics we have, that - that I think you could expect to see. At no time could you see something you could identify.
243:32:46|C|Har|The second part of that question was: Did you see any differences between Cayley and Descartes?
243:32:54|T|CMP|Yes, I think there's a distinctly different morphology involved in these two units. Our pre-flight training is a little different in impression than what I think I saw; and, again, we have, like I say, a 10-power resolution. I think the - the real answer of what this material is, is going to lay in analyzing the data post-flight. We have some good film records, and I think the - When you put that together with the rocks we picked up, we'll have a pretty powerful story that'll explain a lot of things we don't know now. But I think that there are sections of material we called Descartes, particularly the material that makes up Stone and Smoky, and that stuff runs all the way south down to the old Descartes Crater for which the region is named. And that does look texturally entirely different from the Cayley formation.
243:33:46|C|Har|Question number 8, again for Ken: What were your impressions of the back side of the Moon, and were there any surprises?
243:33:57|T|CMP|Well, the impression of the back side is something I tried to collect from the time we got there until the time we left. And I'm still mulling that over in my mind. I've got a lot of transcripts we're going to have to read before I can psych it all out. But, in general, the impression I have is that the material on the back side, when you look at it on as small a detail as I could look, looks to me like it's very much like the material we find on the front side surrounding most of the big craters. The thing that looks different is that the back side is devoid of these large basins. We don't have the large mares; there's very little mare. In fact, on the back side the only mare we saw was really post-TEI, when we could look back and see a big area. But our ground-track didn't pass over any mare in the daylight, so it took a while to psych that out. But I think that was a major difference was the absence of these large basins. And, on the back side, did we see surprises? Well, we went up looking for - with a suspicion that we might find material similar to the Descartes formation located in several areas on the back side, and, indeed, I think we did. I think we saw an awful lot. I think we saw a lot that looks exactly like the Cayley. I think the things that I saw that were - Probably the most surprising thing was the - On the side of a crater called Guyot, which is just to the north and a little west of King Crater - which is right about the eastern limb of the Moon when you look at it from the Earth - we saw a big hole, I'll call it a crater, in the side of this - of the wall of this crater, and it appeared that there was material oozing out. And on our last couple of revs, we passed almost directly overhead, and it looked like it was filled with a pool of material, and then this material had run down the side. And that's a formation typical of things you see like in Hawaii, something I have not seen anywhere else on the Moon, nor have I seen a picture of it.
243:36:03|C|Har|Question number 9 for John and Charlie: At the tag end of EVA-3, you appeared to be having a high-jump competition. Who won, and how high do you think you jumped?
243:36:19|T|CDR|No, we weren't having a competition. We were just showing you some of the things you could do with a 360-pound mass that only weighs 60 pounds, even slowed down, if you will, by the pressure suit. And I don't think anybody won. We were just demonstrating what you can do with the suit.
243:36:44|C|Har|Question 10 -
243:36:45|T|CDR|I don't have any idea how we - how high we jumped. You'll have to look at the TV. Maybe - maybe a foot or two feet.
243:36:56|T|LMP|It was too high for me.
243:37:02|C|Har|Question 10: Could you -
243:37:04|T|LMP|Still have a picture, Hank?
243:37:05|C|Har|- Explain the circumstances surrounding the failure of the Lunar Module Ascent Stage to de-orbit?
243:37:16|T|LMP|I think that has to be worked out when we've looked at all the data - on the ground and discuss it with the flight controllers. At the present time, I have no idea.
243:37:29|T|CDR|No, I don't either.
243:37:34|C|Har|Question 11: To what extent -
243:37:36|T|CMP|Hank, could you verify that you still have a picture? We've lost our monitor, and just like to make sure there's nothing wrong with the camera.
243:37:45|C|Har|We have a good picture. Question 11: To what extent did fatigue affect your performance? For example, do you feel that you would have been capable of a full 7-hour EVA-3, lift-off, and LM jettison all in the same day?
243:38:12|C|Har|Question 12, for each of you -
243:38:16|T|CDR|We could probably - we could probably have done it, but I think that'd really been pushing it.
243:38:25|C|Har|Question 12 for each of you: What do you hope to tell your grandchildren as your most memorable moment of your trip to the Moon?
243:38:40|T|LMP|Well, I'll start with that one, Hank. I have two impressions. The first is the dazzling beauty of Descartes - the surface. It was just one of the most awe-inspiring sights I've ever seen. And secondly, on the EVA, when you look away from the Earth - or the Moon - it's just the utter blackness of space. It really is black out there.
243:39:12|T|CDR|Time number 53 you said that.
243:39:22|T|CMP|Well, I guess I'm next then. I - I thought of - I knew someone would ask that question, and I've been asking that question, too. And I don't think I can put an impression. There's so many that we've crammed in in the last 12 days. And it seems like each one comes on top of the other one, and the immediate response that you come up with is "That's the most fantastic thing I've ever seen." In - in a lot of respects, it really is. There - there have been so many events and so many sights that, in my case, I'm going to have to sit and think about this one for a long time before I could ever pick out one, and then I'm not sure I'll ever be able to say that there was a unique thing, or a most memorable event. The whole thing has been a - just one series of very impressive, and I hate to use the word, but I don't know anything else except to say, "It's fantastic.
243:40:11|T|CDR|I think Ken's got the answer. I think we've seen as much in - in 10 days as most people see in 10 lifetimes. And we certainly have enjoyed it.
243:40:26|C|Har|Question 13: From an astronaut's point of view, would you discuss the possible operation - operational difficulties, besides language, to be overcome in the proposed joint US-USSR manned space flight? And would you have any suggestions to make?
243:40:47|T|CDR|(Laughter) From an astronaut's point of view, I'd - I would not feel qualified to discuss it, other than to say that if language is a problem, I'll be glad to learn Russian. I think Charlie and Ken feel the same way.
243:41:06|C|Har|Question 14: Did the potassium in your diet affect the taste of the food, and did it cause any other problems?
243:41:20|T|CDR|That's a very good question, and I - I'm not sure we're qualified to - to say. We'll have to get back and talk to everybody. I - I don't think it - I didn't notice it being in there as far as taste was concerned. And I don't think anybody else did.
243:41:41|T|LMP|Yeah. This is one of those things where you have to wait and take a look at - in our post-flight medicals and see what they come up with as our body potassium level, because that's really the part that they're trying to work on, and I'm afraid the guys on the ground have a lot more data than we have on our physical condition, other than the fact that we know that we feel good.
243:41:59|T|CDR|Yeah, I think - I think we've been very fortunate to do as much of the mission as we have, considering - considering how much we got slowed there. And I don't know whether potassium had anything to do with it or not, but if it did, I'm sure grateful that we were taking it.
243:42:22|C|Har|Question 15 for John: What did you mean when you said, "Morale went up a couple of hundred percent after the successful TEI." Was it low?
243:42:41|T|CDR|Yes, that's a - No, not particularly. It's just - It would sure be low if you didn't get off the TEI burn, I can tell you that.
243:43:00|C|Har|Question 16 for each of you: Based on your experience, do you have any recommendations right now for the crew of Apollo 17?
243:43:15|T|CDR|Yeah, I recommend they enjoy it as much as we did. I'm sure they will, because, I tell you, we really have - we really have had a lot of sights to see. I'll admit that, in a lot of cases, we worked hard, and - and I suppose the people on the ground were able to tell that. But we got all the support in the world from the - MCC-Houston. I - I mean, I could tell, from every decision that came up from the ground, that there had been a lot of work put into it, and all around the country that there were a lot of wheels turning and people working late hours and solving these problems. And I'm just really happy that Ken, Charlie, and myself got to do this. And I think it's a wonderful experience.
243:44:06|C|Har|That was the last question, John. We thank you very much, and thank you for the kind comments.
243:44:15|T|CDR|Well, let me just say one thing, Hank, and that is - Mr Descartes said it. He said, "There's nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it." And you all know Descartes was a French mathematician and philosopher for whom the region was named. And I guess, really, the story of our mission so far is we've been out testing his theory. My personal assessment of where we are right now, as soon as we get the rocks back in the LRL, we'll be making headway toward proving he was right.
243:45:00|C|Har|Good show, John.
243:45:04|T|LMP|Okay. Hank, as the LEB sinks slowly into the distance, we'll say goodbye.
243:45:41|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
243:45:43|C|Har|Go ahead.
243:45:45|T|LMP|Okay. Hank, you want S-Band Aux back to SCI?
243:45:50|C|Har|Affirmative.
243:45:55|T|LMP|Okay; you got it.
243:46:02|T|Slayton|Nice job there, guys.
243:46:07|T|CDR|Thank you, sir.
243:46:07|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control, Houston [at] 268 hours and 33 minutes [243:46] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now 106,716 nautical miles away from the Earth.

243:46:45|C|Har|Apollo 16, if you'll give us Accept, we'll give you a new state vector.
243:46:52|T|CDR|Roger.
243:48:38|C|Har|Apollo 16, looks like we're getting some stratification in the H<sub>2</sub> tanks. Would you take the H<sub>2</sub> fans on for a minute and then back off again?
243:49:05|C|Har|The computer's yours, 16.
243:49:15|T|LMP|Okay, Hank; and we've got the fans on.
243:49:18|C|Har|Okay. Thank you, Charlie.
243:50:25|T|LMP|Okay; your fans are off.
243:50:27|C|Har|Okay; the tanks look good now.
243:59:18|C|Har|Apollo 16, Houston.
243:59:22|T|LMP|Go ahead.
243:59:23|C|Har|Roger. I got a sort of an outline of our plans here for the rest of the day. You might want to jot these down on your scratch pad, Ken, and then you can operate on the Flight Plan.
243:59:35|T|LMP|Okay; Stand by.
244:00:36|T|CMP|Okay. Hank, why don't you go ahead?
244:00:40|C|Har|Okay. In absence of any thermal problems, this Sco X-1 we're in now is going to run until 270:30 [245:43].
244:00:52|T|CMP|Understand; 270:30 [245:43].
244:00:55|C|Har|Roger. And at the termination - or at 270:30 [245:43], we want you to immediately maneuver to the Skylab attitude, Skylab contamination, and, as soon as you get in attitude, do the photo sequence B - Skylab contamination photo sequence B - and Skylab dump sequence. And do those as quickly as possible. And, in the Dump sequence, number 3, it now reads "Do it 30 minutes after sequence 1." Make that "15 minutes after sequence 1.
244:01:36|T|CMP|Okay; we'll stay with Sco X-1 until 270:30 [245:43]. Then we'll go to Skylab photo sequence B and we'll press right through that and the dump sequences. And we'll do dump sequence number 3 at 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes, and we're ready to press on.
244:01:54|C|Har|Okay. Then, after that, maneuver immediately to attitude of Noun 20 per roll, 128, 042; and we want to do the ecliptic Aux PTC with a minus 0.3 rate and a 2-degree dead band. And that's what we started at 264 hours [239:13] when we got the glitch.
244:02:27|T|CMP|Okay. You want the - the completion of the dump sequences; you want to go to Noun 20 roll, 128 Pitch, 042 in yaw, which will start the ecliptic Aux PTC mode. We'll use 2-degree deadband and minus 0.3 of a degree per second rates.
244:02:45|C|Har|Roger. And it doesn't say how long we're going to -
244:02:49|T|CMP|I can use the thruster configuration I have now.
244:02:52|C|Har|That's affirmative. Use the same con - thruster configuration we had before, and when we finish that sequence - and I'll get you a time on that a little later how long we do that - we're going to go to the ecliptic Aux PTC for the Cyg X-1 photos. And that'll be - at 273:15 [248:28], we want to do that.
244:03:17|T|CMP|Okay. Hank, I didn't follow that. I thought we were in the ecliptic Aux PTC at - for this earlier maneuver. So - say again what happens at 273:15 [248:28].
244:03:27|C|Har|At 273:15 - Excuse me; I may have - I read it to you wrong, Ken. We want to go to the Cyg X-1 point per the Flight Plan.
244:03:41|T|CMP|Okay; at 273:15 [248:28], you'd like to go to the Cyg X-1 per the Flight Plan.
244:03:46|C|Har|Roger. And we want to continue with the 0.5 - degree per second rates in these maneuvers to try to make up as much time as possible until we get back on the Flight Plan at 273:15 [248:28]. And, if we have any thermal problems, just to read you in on what we're thinking, we'll scrub the Skylab contamination first, and the ecliptic Aux second, as required.
244:04:13|T|CMP|Okay. When you say Skylab contamination, you talking about both the dump and the sequence B, or just - are you referring to sequence B?
244:04:23|C|Har|It'll be the whole works, if we have a thermal problem.
244:04:30|T|CMP|Okay,
244:04:33|C|Har|And that's our plan, Ken. Is there any question on that?
244:04:39|T|CMP|No; I think I understand what you want to do.
244:04:41|C|Har|Okay.
244:05:25|C|Har|Charlie, we've got a couple of very special guests here would like to see your biomed, and they guarantee they'll be able to understand it.
244:05:41|T|LMP|Boy, you got me, Hank. It'll be 15 minutes before I can get it up.
244:05:48|C|Har|Roger. Understand.
244:05:51|T|LMP|Oh, I know who you're talking about. Good. Thank you.
244:05:56|C|Har|You're a little slow at that, Charlie.
244:06:00|T|LMP|Yeah, it took me a while there. Thank you. Tell them "Hi".
244:06:22|C|Har|Are you going to do it, Charlie?
244:06:26|T|LMP|Say again?
244:06:28|C|Har|Are you going to do it?
244:06:31|T|LMP|Yeah, I can get some sensors on.
244:06:33|C|Har|Okay.
244:06:46|T|CDR|Well, while we're waiting in the meantime, I can guarantee you old Charlie's alive and well.
244:06:54|C|Har|Roger. By the way, you guys did a - did a great job here on that show.
244:07:03|T|CDR|Thank you, Hank. You - you asked pretty mean questions, I'll tell you that.
244:08:59|C|Har|John, the truth is the backup crew wrote those questions. And I got your Mid-Course 7 PAD and Entry PAD.
244:09:09|T|CDR|Roger; wait a second.
244:09:21|T|CMP|And, Hank, we just completed our EMS check, and it works like a champ.

EMS entry reverse bank at 20,000 foot per second. Okay. These entry angles assume the crew has done the procedure to obtain the entry REFSMMAT. And that's at the bottom of G&C Checklist 4-18. And you must realign the platform to the Entry REFSMMAT, or you'll go into gimbal lock during P67.

244:20:25|T|LMP|And also assume MCC-7.
244:20:27|C|Har|Roger. And you must have the entry REFSMMAT, or you'll go into gimbal lock.
244:20:31|T|CDR|Okay. We got the picture.
244:20:37|T|LMP|And Hank. I'm up on biomed and no - arrhythmias - don't count.
244:20:53|C|Har|They say everything looks fine.
287:22:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 269 hours, 13 minutes [244:26]. We've completed a shift hand over in Mission Control and the Flight Director at the present time is Donald Puddy and our Spacecraft Communicator on this shift is Astronaut Donald Peterson. There will be a change of shift briefing. We expect that that will begin in a little less than 30 minutes at 4:45 pm Central Standard Time. This briefing will be in the News Center Briefing Room, Building 1 at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Again that time estimated at 4:45 pm. A short while ago Capcom Don Peterson read up to the crew the numbers that will be used in the Mid-Course Correction 7. The final Mid-Course prior to Entry is scheduled to occur at about 3 hours before Entry tomorrow at Ground Elapsed Time of 287:22:56, 287 hours, 22 minutes [and] 56 seconds [262:36:54]. And that is our updated Flight Plan time. With Entry occurring at [a] Flight Plan time of 290 hours, 23 minutes [and] 22 seconds [265:37:20]. Our preliminary numbers on events following entry are as follows: The Entry Interface angle as a result of this Mid-Course Correction should be minus 6 and a half degrees, or 6 and a half degrees below local horizontal, which is nominal. 16 seconds after Entry we predict the spacecraft will enter the period of blackout for ionization, [which] blacks-out radio communication. Blackout should end after 3 minutes 32 seconds or rather 3 minutes 32 seconds after [Entry] interface. Blackout would end for a total period of blackout of about 3 minutes 16 seconds. Seven minutes 44 seconds after Entry the two drogue parachutes should deploy, with the main chutes coming out at 8 minutes 30 seconds, and splashdown approximately at 13 minutes 22 seconds after Entry Interface. Mid-Course Correction 7 will be performed with the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters [and] will require a 7 second pulse of these thrusters, producing a total velocity change of 3.1 feet per second. And the purpose of this Mid-Course Correction is for corridor control, to give the spacecraft the desired entry interface angle of 6 and one half degrees, minus 6 and a half degrees. At the present time Apollo 16 is 104,401 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is up to 5,669 feet per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 269 hours, 13 minutes [244:26].

287:22:56|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control. Flight Director Don Puddy has been going around the room, checking with each of his Flight Controllers on our status in this point of the mission, and reviewing the upcoming activities on the Flight Plan for this shift. One of the major things that the crew will be doing during this shift will be a series of operations with the Command and Service module and also with the cameras they're carrying, with three of the cameras, to determine what effects such things as water dumps and various attitudes of the spacecraft have on efforts to photograph dim-light phenomena. This is of particular interest to people doing the planning for Skylab. It will affect such things as Mission Planning and Spacecraft Systems Management during Skylab while astronomy operations are going on in an effort to gain some information on the effects as such things as water dumps on the ability to take dim-light photographs, photographs of dim-light phenomena. The crew will be operating with three cameras, the 16 millimeter [Data] Acquisition Camera, the Nikon and the Hasselblad, all using high speed film and taking photographs at various times and in various attitudes from the CSM. At one point during the Skylab Contamination Sequence they will perform a water dump and will attempt to determine what affect the resultant cloud of particles - ice crystals has on their ability to photograph dim-light phenomena, and also how long the cloud requires to disperse. This entire operation is scheduled for about 2 hours 15 minutes on the Flight Plan. Also, one of the activities, again tonight, will be the operation of the Scientific Instrument Module bay equipment, particularly the Gamma Ray, the Alpha Particle and the X-ray Experiments. One of the targets in deep space will be Sco X-1, this is a hot spot of X-Rays in deep space, the X-Ray Spectrometer Experiment will be pointed at this galactic source of X-rays and will be attempting again to gather information which the principal investigator will use to determine the signature of this particular X-ray source.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.

245:44:07|T|CMP|Don, we're on our way to the Skylab contamination attitude. Is that okay?
245:44:10|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
246:09:57|C|Pet|16, Houston. When you get into this maneuver to the second attitude, we'd like to go Mapping Camera door, Open, and a Gainstep up four steps. And then Stu's got some words for you here on the use of EMP 509 for entry.
246:10:17|T|CMP|Okay. Stand by.
246:10:48|T|CMP|Okay, you've got the Mapping Camera door Open, and you've got the Gainstep up four steps.
246:10:54|C|Pet|Roger. Copy.
246:11:23|T|CMP|Okay. We're on our way. How about giving first a couple of philosophy words on 509, and then, if there's something for us to copy, we'll come back and catch it later with our books.
246:11:35|C|Roo|Okay, Ken. I think we'll not copy anything at this time or make any changes to the Entry Checklist. I would just like to give you a few words on it, let you mull it over. If you have any questions, and then tomorrow morning we'll - we'll make the - the changes. Basically, we're recommending the use of 509 during entry. And, of course, the TVC relay that we've chased around will not be activated during entry. However, all the time there's - there's been this doubt that we can say, specifically, that's the relay. We think it's a high-probability source, however, in lieu of today, in particular. We - we're not sure that - we - we can't rule out that some other EMI might - might glitch that CDU. They've taken a good look - and - look at the wiring in the CDU, and, as it turns out, the 90-degree bit in CDU Z is the most sensitive to being set by EMI. And this bit is wired differently that - than the other bit. So, to preclude going into coarse align, we - we'd like to use 509 for entry. And, of course, this doesn't prevent any glitches, but it does prevent you from locking up the platform with the - with the coarse align: routine. What this is going to -
246:13:13|T|CMP|- -
246:13:14|C|Roo|- what this is - Go ahead, Ken.
246:13:19|T|CMP|I was thinking about the things that happened today. We didn't have to do anything. It didn't lock up anything, and it didn't look like even zeroing the CDUs had any effect on it.
246:13:32|C|Roo|We agree - we agree to that -
246:13:33|T|CMP|- with 509, if we have a glitch, what would - what would you anticipate would be the proper thing to see and the proper response?
246:13:42|C|Roo|Okay, now. As we've said before, the only thing 509 will do for you is to prevent the CMC from going into the coarse-align routine. If you, indeed, get a glitch, you're going to have the CDU indicating a wrong attitude. This would be reflected, most probably, in your Noun 20s, and you could expect the spacecraft, if you're under CMC control, to try to chase off after this Noun 20. And, if it is the 90-degree bit, you would - the 509 would keep you from going into a coarse align. So, if the spacecraft moves, you would not lose your attitude reference, and you could do a Verb 20, zero the CDUs, and be back in business again. That - that's the only - the only thing that we have to offer on the thing is to try to prevent this coarse align, if you get the 90-degree glitch. Now, if you get a glitch in roll - you could get a glitch in roll or pitch. And, under CMC control, it would see this as a - as a erroneous Noun 20 and do whatever is appropriate. If you're in attitude hold, it's going to try to - try to chase it.
246:15:16|T|CMP|Okay.
246:15:17|C|Roo|Okay. And, as I said, let's don't make any changes to the checklist. Let's massage this overnight. But, basically, what you're going to do is continue to use SCS control for your P52s, and then we'll - As we start into our entry program, we'll make one entry as we go into P61, and then 509 protection will be in once average g and P61 comes back up. And then, as you activate the entry DAP, this is going to kill 509, because it - it resets the DAP registers. So after you enter the entry DAP, you're going to have to do your Verb 21 Noun 46 and put - put your three back in R-1 of Noun 46. The procedures look pretty straightforward, Ken. There's - like I say, these two spots where you need to make these entries, they look real straightforward, and it's the same numbers that - that you've been using. And once you have put 509 back in after activation of entry DAP, then it will be in throughout the rest of the entry.
246:16:48|T|CMP|Okay. Sounds like you guys have been working again.
246:16:52|C|Roo|Well, this is (laughter). You know what, this is really chasing a - chasing a spook bit here, but I guess we're probably getting a lot of experts on - on CDUs, and it looks like the - the 509 is - is the way to go. And the question you might have is - well, why didn't we do 509 during the - during the rendezvous if that's what we're concerned about? And there I just didn't want any glitches, and I did want to keep the gimbal lock protection in. Now, something maybe we haven't discussed with you, that if 509 is in and you truly go through your 90 or 270 yaw, you will, most probably, damage the IMU. And you hear the words, "you'll break it," you'll hear the words, "you'll render it unreliable," so forth. So as long as 509 is in, you do not have your true gimbal lock protection because the CMC will never go to coarse align. And I didn't feel it was worth doing that - taking any sort of chance on the platform until we've got down to the entry point, but, once we're here, it's sort of superfluous. If - if you - if you go there, you've lost your reference anyway, no matter what you've done to the - done to the platform, but you should be aware that you have lost this protection.
246:18:20|T|CMP|Okay. Sounds real good, Stu. Thank you, sir.
246:18:23|T|CDR|Yeah. Good work, Stu. Thank you.
246:18:27|C|Roo|Okay. And, if you don't have any more questions on this, I'll - I'll get off the loop, and we will have these specific changes to the Entry Checklist for you tomorrow.
246:18:40|T|CMP|Okay. Don't stay up all night.
246:18:42|C|Roo|No sweat. Don't you either. We'll see you.
246:18:42|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 271 hours 6 minutes [246:19]. That was Astronaut Stuart Roosa discussing entry procedures with the crew.

246:43:18|C|Pet|16, would it help you if we called you to advise you when your rates are sufficiently damped in these different Skylabs.
246:45:20|T|CMP|Don, did you call us?
246:45:23|C|Pet|Yeah, we just wanted to know if we could help you by advising you when your rates are damped, so you wouldn't have to wait for them.
246:45:33|T|CMP|No, we - we're having to restart the sequence, but we'll get it this time, and we'll be pressing on.
246:45:37|C|Pet|Roger.
246:48:48|T|CDR|Houston, when we started the Skylab dump contamination, it didn't - it dumped a little out the side hatch and then it must have flashed - froze - or something, because it stopped immediately. And so Ken is now removing the screw to see if it's - to see if it's still flowing.
246:49:11|C|Pet|Roger. We copy that.
246:49:20|T|CDR|Okay. It's not flowing right now.
246:49:21|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
246:49:31|T|CDR|The heater had been on about - about ten minutes before we started.
246:49:43|C|Pet|I'm not sure what you mean by it "had been on about ten minutes before you started." You mean the dump had started?
246:49:50|T|CDR|Yeah, before we started dumping.
246:49:53|C|Pet|Okay. The bag had been on before you started dumping.
246:49:57|T|CDR|No, not the bag, the heater.
246:50:00|C|Pet|Okay,
246:50:19|T|CDR|Okay. It's flowing again.
246:50:20|C|Pet|Roger. Understand.
246:50:30|C|Pet|And, John, I guess using that heater's about the only thing we know to do. If that doesn't work, we don't have an answer for you.
246:52:47|T|CDR|It's working fine now, Don.
246:52:49|C|Pet|Okay. Thank you.
247:14:33|C|Pet|16, Houston. Since we're going into PTC pretty quick, there are about four things we need to get done.
247:14:45|T|CMP|What are they?
247:14:47|C|Pet|Okay. We need to close the door on the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter and on the X-Ray/Alpha Particle, and we need to make about a one-minute water dump. We need to dump five percent. And we need to get the Gainstep up four steps.
247:15:24|T|CMP|Don, we have another four minutes before we take our last sequence of photos here, and you don't want to take a water dump until we get through with that, do you?
247:15:36|C|Pet|Negative. You can hold off until after the photos.
247:15:41|T|CMP|And we've got the Gainstep set, and we've closed the doors.
247:15:45|C|Pet|Roger.
247:16:43|T|CMP|Okay, Don. You said something about PTC. We show we're going to the - this Cygnus X-1 attitude next.
247:17:03|T|CMP|That's really not what you were supposed to do, though, here. You want us to go to this -

We also have one more meal scheduled for them, which would be dinner and the sleep period is scheduled to begin at 276 hours [251:13]. Apollo 16 at the present time is 95,000 nautical miles from Earth. Travelling at a speed 6,027 feet per second and we're counting down toward entry and splashdown. We now show 18 hours, 17 minutes until entry, and 18, hours 30 minutes until splashdown.
247:22:41|T|CMP|Okay, Don. We're ready for a dump.
247:22:45|C|Pet|Okay. Go ahead.
247:22:50|T|CMP|You want us to dump 5 five percent. Is that correct?
247:22:52|C|Pet|That's affirmative. It should run about one minute.
247:22:57|T|CMP|Okay. We were reading 62 percent when we started. You want us to go to 52?
247:23:06|C|Pet|57, Ken.
247:23:10|T|CMP|Okay.
247:24:01|T|CMP|Don, I think we're through with the water dump.
247:24:07|C|Pet|Okay. It looks good from here. And 16, we'd like to get into a roll as soon as we can because we're running kind of close to the limit on some of the tips.
247:26:15|T|CMP|Jet configuration okay, Don?
247:26:19|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
247:26:24|T|CMP|You don't want us to bring D-2 on for the spinup?
247:26:30|C|Pet|Roger. Bring a couple on for the roll.
247:27:43|||<p class="tech"><b>247 27 43 Peterson:</b> Let's go Pitch minus 40 and Yaw 90 on the High Gain, please.    <p class="ed">[No communications for 23 minutes.]
247:50:55|C|Pet|16, we got about ten items here to talk about. Most of them are real short. We can either try to get to them now, or we can wait a while.
247:51:10|T|CDR|We'd like to wait a while. We're in the midst of our re-entry stowage.
247:51:16|C|Pet|Okay. One of the items here has to do with re-entry - with entry stowage. We'd just like to verify, or have you tell us about any changes that you're making relative to the normal stowage, that is, in accordance with Page 2-17.
247:51:34|T|CDR|That's where we're working on right now, and we'll be - certainly gonna do that, Peter
247:51:40|C|Pet|Okay.
247:53:49|T|LMP|Okay.
248:00:56|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
248:00:58|C|Pet|Go ahead 16.
248:01:01|T|LMP|Pete, we're busy with this entry stowage. Could you keep us on the Flight Plan if something comes up.
248:01:06|C|Pet|Okay. Will do.
248:01:08|T|LMP|Thank you.
248:12:18|C|Pet|16, we're having some thermal problems in the SIM bay. We'd like to stop the roll at 274 degrees, and get the Sun on the SIM bay.
248:12:33|T|CDR|Roger. Stop the roll at 274 degrees, and get the Sun on the SIM bay.
248:12:37|C|Pet|That's affirmative. Thank you.
248:16:44|T|CDR|Okay. You've got 274 about there, Pete.
248:16:49|C|Pet|Okay, John. Thank you.
248:16:49|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 273 hours, 3 minutes [248:16]. We've had the crew stop the Passive Thermal Control, a slow rotation of the spacecraft, because of a cold spot that our Orbital Science officer had been watching in the Scientific Instrument Module Bay. We're going to have them hold in an attitude where the Sun is shining on this bay for about 30 minutes. That should warm it up and at that point we'll have them go back into the Passive Thermal Control mode rotating at about 3 revolutions per hour. The feeling is that at that point the cold area of the SIM bay will get a chance to warm up. In the previous attitude, that area was cold soaking pointed away from the Sun and the Passive Thermal Control was simply not bringing the temperature up as rapidly as OSO, the Orbital Science Officer, would have liked, so we stopped the Passive Thermal Control rotation pointing the SIM bay at the Sun and letting it warm up for about 30 minutes before re-entering the PTC or Passive Thermal Control. Apollo 16 is 91,358 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is now creeping upward from 6,000 feet per second. We're showing 6,166 feet per second at the present time.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 273 hours, 3 minutes [248:16].

248:40:27|C|Pet|16, we think we may have stratification in H<sub>2</sub> tanks 1 and 2. Would you give us about one minute on the fans?
248:40:35|T|CDR|Roger. H<sub>2</sub> Tanks 1 and 2, one minute on the fans.
248:44:55|C|Pet|16, we noticed the cabin pressure drop about a tenth and the O<sub>2</sub> flow go up a little bit. Are you doing something that might have caused that?
248:45:09|T|LMP|Negative. Sure not.
248:45:14|C|Pet|Okay. And also we have a maneuver for you. We'd like you to do the Verb 49 maneuver to the X-Ray pointing thermal attitude [for] Cyg X-1. It's at 273:15 in your Flight Plan, but I'll read you the angles, if you want.
248:45:31|T|CDR|Appreciate it.
248:45:33|C|Pet|Okay. It's 278, 295, and 310.
248:45:48|C|Pet|And the High-Gain angles are Pitch 11 and Yaw 330.
248:45:56|T|CDR|Roger. Pitch 11; Yaw 330; attitude 278, 295, and 310.
248:46:05|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
248:46:07|T|CDR|Okay. We're going there now.
245:46:09|C|Pet|Okay. And we're watching the cabin pressure. It's steady again now.
248:46:20|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. It looks about like where it's been to us. We think it's been hanging a little bit below 5 [psi].
248:46:30|C|Pet|Yeah. That's affirmative, and EECOM says that could be the cabin regs making up that's causing what he's seeing.
248:46:39|||<p class="tech"><b>248 46 39 Duke:</b> Okay.    <p class="obcm"><b>248 46 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).
248:50:07|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. You want us to dump the OPS again? We would like to finally stow it, and we can dump it now if you want.
248:50:15|C|Pet|Okay. We would like to use the OPS to get the cabin up to 5.6, and then leave it in bleed flow thorough the sleep period.
248:50:26|T|LMP|Okay.
248:50:53|T|CDR|That bleed flow means leaving the hose in the port and leave it on, right?
248:51:00|C|Pet|Stand by a minute, John. I'll check
248:51:42|C|Pet|16, we need you to check that dump in the hatch where you just made the Skylab dump from. We're still showing a little high on the 0<sub>2</sub> flow.
248:51:58|T|LMP|Flow just went to 0.2 here, Pete.
248:52:02|C|Pet|Yeah. Roger. EECOM's just calling it. We're seeing it drop off here now.
248:52:19|C|Pet|Okay. On the OPS configuration, we wanted the OPS connector locked in the stowage plate, and turn the OPS Actuator to On.
248:52:33|C|Pet|That's after you dump the cabin up.
248:52:38|T|CDR|Okay. That's what we'll do
248:54:19|C|Pet|16, on the High Gain, I think the angles we called up are wrong. Let's go Pitch 55, Yaw 323.
248:54:42|T|CDR|Okay. We're at the Sco X-1 attitude, as you know.
248:54:46|C|Pet|Roger. And go Wide on the High Gain.
248:55:04|T|LMP|Pete, it doesn't seem to be acquiring in Reacq. I stepped it through.
248:55:14|C|Pet|Okay. And Charlie, did you copy to try 55 degrees on Pitch and 323 on Yaw? And the first set of angles we called up were not correct.
248:55:24|T|LMP|Okay. My mistake.
248:55:49|C|Pet|No, Charlie. That was our mistake. The first set of angles we called up were wrong.
248:55:56|T|LMP|Okay. 55 and 323.
248:55:58|C|Pet|Affirmative.
248:56:18|T|CDR|Okay, Houston. We got it turned on. It's got about 200 pounds in it; it's just barely making any noise.
248:56:25|C|Pet|Roger.
248:57:02|C|Pet|And 16, would you give us Gamma Ray Shield, Off, please?
248:57:07|T|LMP|Okay.
248:57:24|C|Pet|Okay.
248:59:03|C|Pet|16, with the OPS flow, we're still looking at an O<sub>2</sub> flow that is higher than normal. And we'd like you to take a look at the nozzle on the hatch window there and make sure that - on the hatch there and make sure that it's secured.
248:59:50|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. We'll reinstall it. I got the cover hand - tight as I can get it, and we'll take the cover off and reinstall the nozzle.
248:59:59|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie.
249:03:24|C|Pet|Okay? Charlie. Looks like the O<sub>2</sub> flow is down to about what we'd expect now.
249:03:31|T|LMP|Okay, Pete. We're cleaning off the suit return hoses and the inlet to the suits circuit.
249:03:48|C|Pet|Roger.
249:05:47|C|Pet|16, would you verify the H<sub>2</sub> Tanks 1 and 2 Fans Off, please?
249:05:54|T|LMP|That's affirmative.
249:05:56|C|Pet|Okay. Thank you.
249:11:35|C|Pet|16, we need the X-Ray Off for two seconds and then back On. We're trying to keep it out of the attenuate mode for the next few minutes here.
249:11:45|T|CDR|Roger. You have it, Houston.
249:11:52|C|Pet|Thank you.
249:11:52|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 274 hours, 5 minutes [249:18]. The crew aboard Apollo 16 at the present time is primarily involved in operating the SIM bay instruments, the Gamma Ray, Alpha Particle and X-Ray Spectrometer. They also have an eat period coming up at about this time. And we plan to put them to bed [at] 276 hours [251:13] or about 2 hours from now. We've had relatively little conversation with the crew; one of the last items discussed was fluctuating cabin oxygen pressure, it turned out that this fluctuation was caused by apparently dirty screens on a cabin inlet outlet vents for the oxygen flow and once the crew cleaned these off which is a normal procedure the flow rate settled down to a steady level. Also we've discussed with them the OPS pressure, this is the Oxygen Purge System, one of two emergency units carried by the two crewmen on the lunar surface on top of their Portable Life Support Systems. These are available to provide emergency oxygen and cooling, on the lunar surface. One of these OPS units is carried back into the Command Module following the lunar surface activities and is available for any contingency during the Command Module EVA. That now behind us, it's desirable to get the OPS which starts out with a very high pressure, somewhere around 5,900 pounds per square inch on the lunar surface, bled down to virtually nothing at entry. The OPS has been used for the last couple of nights to pump up the cabin, prior to the crew sleep for they pressurize the cabin, let the pressure up and let it gradually decay down from the normal level, by the time they awake, using the OPS provides this surge of oxygen rapidly bleeds its pressure down. It's down now to about 200 pounds per square inch and the crew is allowing the remaining approximately one quarter of a pound of oxygen that remains in the bottle to bleed off. We expect that it will be down very close to zero, if not at zero, by the time the spacecraft re-enters tomorrow. And we're now showing entry 16 hours, 16 minutes away; splashdown 16 hours, 29 minutes from now. Apollo 16 at the present time is 87,550 nautical miles from Earth travelling at a speed of 6,329 feet per second.</p>    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 274 hours, 5 minutes [249:18].

249:19:40|C|Pet|16, would you verify that the X-Ray/Alpha Cover is Open, 16?
249:19:50|T|LMP|We got it closed.
249:19:54|C|Pet|Okay. Would you open it, please?
249:19:56|T|LMP|It's open now, Pete.
249:19:58|C|Pet|Roger. Thank you.
249:27:19|C|Pet|16, we're asking for some stuff that's at 273:50 [249:03] in the Flight Plan. We need a report on the Command Module RCS injector valve temps.
249:27:47|T|CMP|Okay. It's in work.
249:27:49|C|Pet|Okay. Do you want me to give you a call out on the systems test meter positions or not?
249:27:55|T|CDR|No, we can figure that out, probably.
249:28:13|T|LMP|Pete, 5 Charlie is 4.3; 5 Delta is 4.6; 6 Alpha is 4.2; 6 Bravo is 4.4; 6 Charlie is greater than 5; and 6 Delta is 4.4.
249:28:44|C|Pet|Roger. Copy. And also, we'd like to remind you of a LiOH canister change, 23 in the Bravo and Stow 21 in A-5.
249:28:58|T|LMP|Okay.
249:30:50|C|Pet|16, we need the Gamma Ray, Shield; On.
249:30:59|T|LMP|Okay. You have it.
249:31:02|C|Pet|Roger. Thank you. And, Charlie, you let us know when you get the LiOH canister changed.
249:31:12|T|LMP|Being done right now.
249:31:14|C|Pet|Roger. And 16, we've got a new attitude for you. The angles are 164, 134, 035. High Gain angles, Pitch minus 23, yaw 101.
249:31:41|T|CMP|We got it, Pete. Thank you.
249:31:50|T|LMP|Okay. The LiOH canister's changed.
249:31:53|C|Pet|Roger. Copy.
249:39:16|C|Pet|Okay, 16. Let's try to bring the High Gain up.
249:57:30|C|Pet|And 16, I'm still sitting here with about six items, a couple of which require readings. Most of them just require a little talking. Anytime you can get to it - well, let's get started on it.
249:57:42|T|LMP|Okay. Just as soon as we get Ken on comm.
249:57:45|C|Pet|Roger.
250:01:03|T|CMP|Hello, Houston.
250:01:05|C|Pet|Go ahead, 16.
250:01:08|T|CMP|Understand you have a few words.
250:01:10|C|Pet|Roger. First of all, I guess we wanted to check with you on any changes to entry stowage, and particularly the LiOH canisters, to check that they are stowed according to the entry stowage list.
250:01:26|T|CMP|LiOH canisters are stowed according to the entry stowage list, and the entry stowage is essentially complete except for the items that we need to work out tomorrow. And, of course, tying down the suit under the right-hand seat.
250:01:46|C|Pet|Roger.
250:01:48|T|CMP|Okay. There's a couple of things that we couldn't stow as per nominal. They are the fecal bag and the goodie bag. And we intend to tie those down in the LEB. The goodie bag is the IN Data File.
250:02:07|C|Pet|Roger. Understand IN data file and the fecal bag are gonna be tied down in the LEB.
250:02:12|T|CMP|That's affirmative. And we know we can tie those down enough to withstand any kind of re-entry. You might even help L-over-D. I don't - You know how much the IN Flight Data File weighs? Less the Contingency Checklist and the Timeline Book. And that's a total - mostly the total weight of that bag.
250:02:31|C|Pet|Roger. Okay. We - we also need the battery compartment reading one more time before you go to bed tonight. And I guess if you want to, we could get that out of the way now.
250:02:49|T|CMP|2.75.
250:02:50|C|Pet|Understand, 2.75.
250:02:55|T|CMP|That's affirmative.
250:03:09|C|Pet|Okay. And, Charlie, we want you on the biomed tonight. And it looks like we're gonna have to reverse the top two sensor wires, because apparently - either you got them hooked up backwards, or we're getting the signal turned around somewhere in the transmission.
250:03:32|C|Pet|Charlie, that's - we want to reverse -
250:03:34|T|LMP|Yeah, is the lon - The long one's the ground, isn't it?
250:03:39|C|Pet|Negative. Stand by just a minute.
250:03:55|C|Pet|Okay, Charlie. The long one goes to the sternum, and the branching one goes off to the right.
250:04:11|T|LMP|Well, I got them on like I been wearing them all week.
250:04:20|C|Pet|Roger.
250:04:31|C|Pet|Okay. And the surgeons wanted you to know they appreciated your status - the good status report you gave them this morning. And they hope you can find time to give them a good one again tomorrow morning.
250:05:05|C|Pet|Okay. We got one other item. We just want to make sure that we don't get any uncoupled attitude control after 277 hours [252:13] GET. That's to ensure that we get precise tracking for at least 10 hours prior to Mid-Course 7.
250:05:31|T|CMP|Okay. I'm as interested in that as you are.
250:05:34|C|Pet|Roger.
250:05:51|C|Pet|Okay. And I guess we've got some news items here for you. And I think that'll wrap it up.
250:06:01|T|CDR|Okay. Go ahead.
250:06:04|C|Pet|Okay. I guess the biggest news was that President Nixon went on national television tonight to discuss the military situation in Vietnam. He said efforts toward Vietnamization of the war were proving effective. And he announced additional US troop withdrawals of 20,000 men by July the first. At the same time, the President characterized the current North Vietnamese advances into South Vietnam as an open invasion. And he said US air and naval forces will continue to attack military targets in North Vietnam to assure the safety of remaining US forces in South Vietnam and to prevent a military takeover of South Vietnam by the North. The President also said US negotiators would return to the Paris peace talks, as he put it, "To get on with the constructive business of obtaining peace." "The first order of business," he said, "will be to get the North Vietnamese to stop their invasion and to secure the release of Americans being held prisoner." And we got an item here on Apollo 16. The headline says, "Spaceship Speeds Up, Zeros in on Earth." Apollo 16 picked up speed today from the gravitational embrace of Earth as scientists awaited the delivery of samples that may rewrite the history of the Moon. Astronauts John Young, Charles Duke, and Thomas Mattingly II, were due to enter the atmosphere of Earth, Thursday afternoon, at 24,000 miles per hour. Apollo 16 is returning 240 pounds of Moon samples. But the flight's lunar legacy consists of more than just rocks. Mattingly spent an hour walking in space Tuesday to retrieve two holders containing the exposed film of powerful mapping and panoramic cameras. With only one mission remaining in the Apollo Program, the cameras' pictures, taken from lunar orbit, are expected to provide much knowledge about areas of the Moon that man will not visit for a long time. And a little - little bit on the Democratic campaign here. "Muskie dealt 1-2 blow by McGovern in Massachusetts and HHH in Pennsylvania. Senator George McGovern, triumphant in Massachusetts, and Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, the Pennsylvania victor, joined head-on political battle today after dealing a 1-2 blow to the Presidential campaign of Senator Edmund Muskie. Muskie finished a far-back second in Massachusetts, and managed only a virtual third-place tie with McGovern and Wallace in Pennsylvania where he concentrated his campaign. Alabama Governor George C. Wallace got 21 percent with 97 percent of the precincts tallied in Pennsylvania, after staging a 1-day campaign. Massachusetts gave Wallace 8 percent of the vote in partial returns, just ahead of Humphrey. Next Tuesday McGovern and Humphrey confront each other, Muskie, and Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington in Ohio battle for 153 convention delegates." A couple of items on - on the re-entry area. The USS Ticonderoga, the primary recovery ship for Apollo 16, has arrived at the new splashdown site, 1,500 miles south of Honolulu. The forecast for Thursday splash was unlimited visibility with temperatures in the 80s. Seas are expected to be one to three feet with swells to five feet. And the weather here in Houston is low tonight in the low 60s, high Thursday in the low 80s, and the weather's been clear to partly cloudy today. And the Houston Astros did it again. They won their eighth consecutive baseball victory last night, a hard-fought 5 to 4 verdict over the Chicago Cubs. The win kept Houston in a tie with Los Angeles for first place in the National League West. And let's see, I guess we'll close -
250:09:57|T|LMP|- Go get 'em. It's a big "Atta boy" for the Astros.
250:10:01|C|Pet|Roger.
250:10:15|C|Pet|And we got one last item here, which is entitled "Slick Trick by an Eager Beaver" from Flint, Michigan. Dedication to duty is fine, say Flint city officials, but the man who turned several miles of city streets into an ice rink carried that concept too far. He had been told to use the city water truck to wash the streets Tuesday morning. He did. Dutifully ignoring the three degrees below freezing temperature. His trail was clearly marked by irate drivers trying to navigate their dented cars over the glassy surface. Officials said salt crews were dispatched, but the Sun came out and melted the problem before they did.
250:11:06|T|LMP|Thanks a lot, Pete.
250:11:08|C|Pet|You bet.
250:11:09|T|CDR|Yeah. That's the way - that's the way the Rover drives. Like it's on ice.
250:11:14|C|Pet|Roger.
250:11:25|T|CMP|We appreciate that good news, Pete.
250:11:28|C|Pet|Roger.
262:36:54|P|PAO|This is Apollo Control at 275 hours, 19 minutes [250:32], and we've heard relatively little from the crew for the last 30 minutes or so. Earlier this evening they've been involved in getting everything stowed and ready for the entry and splashdown tomorrow, which is now some 15 hours, 17 minutes away. They also have a number of the instruments in the Scientific Instrument Module bay in operation - the Gamma Ray, Alpha Particle and X-ray sensors. And they should be in the midst of an eat period, getting their dinner prior to retiring for what will be their last night of sleep aboard Casper.

Earlier this evening they've been involved in getting everything stowed and ready for the entry and splashdown tomorrow, which is now some 15 hours, 17 minutes away. They also have a number of the instruments in the Scientific Instrument Module bay in operation - the Gamma Ray, Alpha Particle and X-ray sensors. And they should be in the midst of an eat period, getting their dinner prior to retiring for what will be their last night of sleep aboard Casper.

250:45:30|T|CMP|Hey, Don.
250:45:33|C|Pet|Go ahead.
250:45:37|T|CMP|What would you folks think about my going to whatever attitude I'm going to do PTC in tonight and get it all damped and ready to set up?
250:45:45|C|Pet|Stand by a minute.
250:45:48|T|CMP|Okay.
250:46:25|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. You can go ahead.
250:46:32|T|CMP|Okay; and that's a Pitch of 43 and Yaw of 335. Is that affirm?
250:46:38|C|Pet|That's affirmative.
250:46:41|T|CMP|Okay, sir. And this PTC will be a normal PTC with no engines enable. Correct?
250:46:50|C|Pet|I believe that's right, Ken. Stand by one.
250:46:59|T|LMP|Houston, 16.
250:47:01|C|Pet|Go ahead.
250:47:03|T|LMP|Okay; it looks like we've got a H<sub>2</sub> Tank 1 that's a little above the green line - about 270. Oh that's - Excuse me; that's the one with the sen - bad sensor. Excuse me.
250:47:17|C|Pet|Roger.
250:47:28|C|Pet|And, Ken, that is a normal PTC.
250:47:32|T|CMP|Thank you, sir.
250:47:49|C|Pet|Okay, Ken. And in connection with that, we want to verify that the Pitch is minus 40, Yaw is 90 on the High Gain.
250:47:59|T|CMP|That's verified.
250:48:02|C|Pet|And -
250:48:03|T|LMP|And, Pete, I was ready to sack out. Did y'all come to any conclusion about this biomed?
250:48:13|C|Pet|Charlie, you can leave it just like it is.
250:48:16|T|LMP|Thank you.
250:48:18|C|Pet|And one other item we need, I guess, is a readout on Battery C and Pyro Batteries A and B voltage. This will be the last chance we'll get to look at them.
250:48:29|T|LMP|Okay; stand by. Battery C is 36&frac12;. The Pyro Bats are both 36&frac12;.
250:48:40|C|Pet|Roger; copy. Thank you.
250:49:15|C|Pet|Okay. And, Ken, we need an E-MOD, and we're ready to call it a night.
250:49:22|T|CMP|Okay. I guess - I guess I could do that while we're doing the maneuver.
250:59:28|T|CMP|Don, I've got one more question for you.
250:59:31|C|Pet|Okay; go ahead.
250:59:36|T|CMP|When it comes time to change REFSMMATs, to go to the entry REFSMMAT tomorrow, I've been thinking about our - our funnies that we've seen with the CDUs, and when we were looking at that one this afternoon, it in - in some ways hinted that maybe we - maybe we didn't have all that D to A and A to D stuff working the way it ought to. Would there be any advantage of - Maybe someone could think about it tonight, maybe they already are - but is there any advantage to doing a pulse torque to change REFSMMATs tomorrow instead of by the usual procedure of using the coarse align.
251:00:25|C|Pet|Okay. I understand what you're asking. Stand by just a minute. Okay. Ken, we'll work on that and get back to you first thing in the morning with it.
251:00:42|T|CMP|Okay. I don't have any strong druthers. I just - I was thinking over the things we might be going through and kind of wondered if that might be prudent if I avoided that loop. But if everybody's happy with it, it's certainly a lot easier to coarse align.
251:00:57|C|Pet|Okay. We'll take a good close look at it tonight and let you know in the morning first thing.
251:01:02|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.

259:58:57|C|Eng|Okay.
259:58:58|T|CDR|On Meal C, scratch the beef steak, scratch the fruitcake and the pecans, and add tuna salad, &frac34; of a tin.
259:59:16|C|Eng|Okay, got it.
259:59:22|T|CDR|Okay, and the injector valve temps are looking as follows: 5C, 4.5; 5D, 4.6; 6A, 4.1; 6B, 4.4; 6C, 4.9; 6D, 4.4. Which means no heatup.

260:28:24|C|Har|They're debating that, Ken. Just a second.
260:28:28|T|CMP|Okay. The Noun 20s check with the FDAI very closely.
260:28:41|C|Har|Okay. Ken, why don't you press on through that malfunction 6 there on Page 28; and remember, if you get down to box 12, you have to kill the DAP.

260:40:54|T|CMP|No, sir. And the ISS light is out.
260:41:45|T|CDR|Let me tell you what the only thing we can think of that might have happened. Charlie's down in the LEB, and Tool E, it sounded like, got knocked against the Panel down there, if you can believe that.
260:42:03|C|Har|Tool E hit the panel and the light went away?
260:42:07|T|CDR|That, we can't say that for sure. That's the only action that - that I can think of that was going on at the time.

261:26:59|T|CMP|Okay, Manual on the boresight.
261:27:01|C|Roo|Okay. And now, after you drive the Optics to 90 degrees, we want to delete the Optics power, off. And we want to verify Optics Speed, Lo. And we're going to leave the Optics power on and, here in the mysterious world of glitches, this is going to minimize the probability. So we're gonna come in with it on, and we'll put the Speed to Lo just to hold down the drift.
261:27:36|T|CMP|Okay, after the 90-degree shaft, why, we'll - delete Optics power off and verify that the Speed is Lo.
261:27:45|C|Roo|Okay, now let's go to 2-2. Thank you. I need to be looking at this instead of that.
261:27:53|T|CMP|Okay, 2-2.
261:27:57|C|Roo|Okay. Now, after we get down to - after the P61 entry prep and prior to entering P61, we want to add - and the - what we're doing here, Ken, is we're resetting the average-g flag, which we set in 509. And if we do not do this step - now this is a - a pretty critical step - if we do not reset that average-g flag, P61 will not call average g. So our procedure here before we go into P61 is a Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, Enter. And if for some reason P61 would not call up average g, your fastest and most obvious cue is that lack of the comp cycle before Noun 61 comes up. If you don't reset this, your Noun 61 comes up immediately, but - with 509 running, we've got to get this step in or we'll not pick up our average g.
261:29:15|T|CMP|Okay, That's a good one to know.
261:29:17|C|Roo|Roger. And how about just reading that step back to me there.
261:29:21|T|CMP|Okay. Before calling P61, I'm going to reset the average-g flag with a Verb 25 Noun 7, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, and 0 Enter. And I'll do that prior to calling P61.
261:29:33|C|Roo|Okay. Jolly good. And let's go over to 2-4.
261:29:40|T|CMP|Okay. On 2-4.
261:29:42|C|Roo|Okay. And what we're doing here now is, after you have Pro and you activate the Entry DAP, at that time, your Noun 46 first digit is dropped to a zero. To reactivate EMP 509, after the flashing 06 61 comes up, let's insert in there a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter. And, of course, all we're doing here is putting the 3 back in Noun 46 and this was dropped, as I say, when you went into the Entry DAP.
261:30:26|T|CMP|Okay. The - you want to do that after - Line 13, or before that?
261:30:32|C|Roo|Okay. After line 13, in between the flashing 06 61 and before the PRO.
261:30:53|T|CMP|Okay. Stu, after flashing 61 and before Proceeding on that, we'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46, 30000 Enter.
261:31:06|C|Roo|Roger. You'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.
261:31:11|T|CMP|That's right.
261:31:13|C|Roo|Okay. And you got the picture of why we're having to do that?
261:31:18|T|CMP|Yes, sir.
261:31:19|C|Roo|Okay. Now the - now, if you'll pick up your cue card, we'll change it to the same things that we've just gone over in the checklist here.
261:31:30|T|CMP|Okay.
261:31:33|C|Roo|Okay. Prior to your P61, add Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, 0 Enter.
261:31:52|T|CMP|Okay. I'll reset that flag before P61.
261:31:57|C|Roo|Okay. And, back down here in your P62 box, same thing we just talked about. Prior to the Pro, after the 06 61, add Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.
261:32:19|T|CMP|Okay. Got that.
261:32:25|C|Roo|Okay. And - got a - a change here to your Systems Checklist - and this is just changing to reflect the increased pressure in the battery compartment. If you'd like to change that, it's Page S/l-2, under Step 3.
261:33:23|T|CMP|Okay.
261:33:25|C|Roo|Okay. Down - toward the bottom of the page, about three lines up, we've got a comment in there. "If greater than 1.5, Battery Vent valve, Vent." We want to change that 1.5 to 3.4.
261:33:55|T|CMP|Okay. We change that to 3.4.
261:33:58|C|Roo|Okay. It's a pretty innocuous change. And the one - the line right above that, too - "Systems Test 7-A, battery compartment pressure less than 1.5," change that to 3.4, also.
261:34:09|T|CMP|Okay.
261:34:38|T|CMP|Okay. Thank you.
261:34:40|C|Roo|Roger. Oh, I'd like to also add here, Ken, and - of course, as you well know, we - in this mysterious glitch solutions, we gotta shotgun it, and we're trying to find the areas that are a prime candidate for glitch in the CDU. And one of these is during your GDC align procedure, when you have your Att Set switch to Att Set and you either switch in to or out of IMU on the Source. What you're doing here is loading up the CDU's, and they feel that this is a prime candidate for a glitch. So, our words of wisdom are to minimize the number of times that you use this switch, and I guess after your GDC align in the normal checklist;, we'd kind of like to see you not cycle that Source switch to IMU with your Att Set switch in Att Set. I guess you could still check your GDC versus Noun 20s if you wanted to, but I did want you to be aware of this particular switch combination as - as loading up the CDU. And this is where we have the probability of glitches.
261:36:07|T|CMP|Okay, thank you.
261:36:09|C|Roo|And just -
261:36:10|T|CDR|As you know, we've - we've only aligned the GDC IMU a thousand times, and I don't think that's had anything to do with the glitch we've had so far.
261:36:30|C|Roo|Yeah, we realize that, John. The problem is - we don't know what - what's causing the glitch. We just, at this time, can't say.
261:36:31|T|CDR|That's true, but I'm saying that - Oh, never mind, never mind.

263:26:56|T|CMP|Okay. Looks like we're between - just before doing the P52. Go ahead, Stu.
263:27:04|C|Roo|Okay. This deals with the - our favorite problem, of course, the - your ISS warning. And, right now, you people are doing all the right things and we're wanting to do those same procedures right through - right through entry when, of course, when ISS comes on, I'm sure you're going to go to Spacecraft Control, which you've been doing and you've been checking that alarm code. And we're saying that, if you have that 3 triple 7, to ignore it. Whe - it's - whether it needs it or not, just to keep the procedure straightforward, we - after you - while you're still in SCS, do a Verb 40 Enter and wait your 10 seconds, and go back to CMC. So, this means that we're saying - we'll come all the way in CMC with that 3 triple 7 alarm showing. If you do get a - if you do have a CDU failure, why, you will see it in your - in your bank angle - your - which is just your normal procedures there where you're looking at your commanded DSKY angle versus what the spacecraft is doing. Also, if you have got a glitch in the CDU, such as we got on the way out, and it's not the 90-degree bit - of course, if the 90-degree bit is set, you'll have the gimbal lock telling you that. And it's again the same old bit, SCS, Verb 40, wait 10 seconds, back to CMC. You can get some glitches, of course, in the CDUs that are not the 90-degree bit. I mean, there's a possibility of it. And, just some words on that - if - if the - if it's a low angle bit set, I say less than 30 degrees, you - it really does not affect your target point. I mean, we're talking in the order of being very close to nominal, within a mile or so. If - if the bit set is large enough for you to see it, comparing the - I mean if the bit set is gonna affect your splashdown point by any appreciable amount, you'll see it comparing your commanded angle versus where the spacecraft is going. So, that's your clue. And, if you see this and it's not looking right, we want you to go to SCS, do a Verb 40, and back to CMC to see if that solves the problem.
263:30:02|T|CMP|Okay. That all sounds reasonable.
263:30:05|C|Roo|Okay. And I guess the - I guess this - about the only thing I'm saying, Ken, - that's any appreciable difference is this Verb 40 bit. I'm not used to doing that during the entry and I'd like to emphasize that if you're not - if it's looking funny and you're not sure, well, go ahead and do it. And, of course, as you well know, the needles will zero and the DAP will be off for 10 seconds, and you'll be back in business. There's one other point, and I'll admit this is - this stretching pretty - pretty thin, but we're trying to cover all the angles. If it's prior to P64, where you're going along - Of course, if you're in CMC control and you get a glitch, why you'll get the response from the DAP. If you're going along in SCS control and you get a glitch, why, your needles will go out. Now, you may have your pitch needle already pegged. So there's - here again, we might have a glitch in that pitch needle - in the pitch CDU and not know it. So, just one other recommendation is if your pitch needle doesn't come off the peg the way you like it, why, let's try a Verb 40 before we would say the - the G&amp;N is not doing correctly.
263:31:25|T|CMP|Okay.
263:31:39|C|Roo|And I guess that about takes care of it, Ken, John, unless you got any - Charlie, unless you got any questions. It'd probably be John punching up the - the alarm there and, if you do get the 3777, why, let's reset it and press ahead. And, of course, any of the other triple-7 alarms are - are valid. And - but, of course, it's the same old monitoring bit. You're going to see how she goes.
263:32:14|T|CMP|Okay, Stu. I think that's all pretty well understood. Thank you very much.
263:32:18|C|Roo|Roger.
263:32:20|T|CDR|Yes, Stu. We appreciate it.
263:32:22|C|Roo|Okay.

I'm not going to make a long speech because that isn't my nature. But I've been working with a couple of guys for about two years, they've always demonstrated [that] they're clever, intelligent, resourceful and all the good words. But in the last 10 days on a mission where kind of critical things had to go just right where we had some rather difficult problems and rather minor problems, Ken and Charlie, performed an outstanding manner. Their professional cool courage and discipline in situations which required time critical button punching, stick throwing, switch pulling, was tremendous and they also exhibited a cool, professional courage in situations where they were involved in some personal risk, I feel. So to them I would like to say outstanding, for your performance. For the benefit of you Navy guys that's a hardy well done. The second group of people is the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, in Houston, Texas and around the country, who did so much during our mission to make it go. We could tell by every message that came to us, that there had been a lot of people working all over the country to do their jobs. And by golly we appreciate it because we made that mission go, thanks to you. The third group of people, that nobody ever talked about much, is the American taxpayer, I think you taxpayers, we taxpayers, you got your money's worth on this one. You really did. You saw an example of go-oriented team work and action. The kind of thing that made this country great and the kind of thing that's going to keep it that way. You also saw and sitting right there in Casper right now a mission of discovery. There are secrets in that vehicle that nobody knows what is in there. There is some basic knowledge and understanding in that vehicle right now. We're going to find those things out and one of these days, it's going to benefit us all. I can guarantee you, I feel that if we hadn't done our mission we'd have been remiss in not uncovering this basic knowledge. And what I'm saying is that that basic knowledge is locked in those secrets. It's pushing back the last real frontier, the frontier of the unknown. And by golly that's essential to the survival of humanity on this planet. And the fourth group of people and maybe the people I feel more at home with than anybody is the good old US Navy, thanks for being here, cause I'll tell you right about now, Charlie, Ken, and myself aren't swimming too good.</p>     <p class="pao"><b>Young:</b> It really is great to be back.
