<b>124:14:10</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, we're just about underway.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:14:18</b> Young: Okay; we're going to follow our footsteps back.<p>

<b>124:14:21</b> Duke: Okay, that's a good idea.  (Pause)  Tony, did you
read?<p>

<b>124:14:29</b> England: Yeah, we sure did.<p>

<b>124:14:30</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>124:14:31</b> England: Okay, and we're looking at...<p>

<b><a name="1241432">124:14:32</a></b> Duke: Okay; we're underway.<p>

<b><a name="1241438">124:14:38</a></b> England: And, we're looking at a few changes there at Spook.  We're going to cut that station down to about 19 minutes.

<blockquote><i>[Pre-mission planning assumed they would leave 
<a href="a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new">Flag Crater</a> at an
EVA elapsed time of about 4+57.  The EVA started at <a
href="a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new">118:53:33</a> and, consequently, they are 5 hours 21 minutes into it and about 24 minutes behind schedule.  They had planned to make a 5-minute drive back to Spook and then a 56-minute stop.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:14:45</b> England: And if you get there in time, (As per 
<a href="a16.lsp069.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-34 and CDR-35</a>) we'll have John go ahead, as nominal, and do the LPM (Lunar Portable Magnetometer).  And then we'll end (with) the LPM site measurement.  And Charlie, you can do your 500-millimeter (photos) near the edge of Spook, and do a pan near the rim of Spook.  And run over and do a couple of samples of Buster if you have time left.  And that'll be our Station 2.<p>

<b>124:15:09</b> Duke: Okay, why the cutback?<p>

<b>124:15:17</b> England: Okay;  it's your (cooling) water consumption there, Charlie. <p>

<b>124:15:23</b> Duke: Ah, rats!  Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Although Houston is concerned about Charlie's use rate of PLSS feedwater, the fact that they are about a half-hour behind schedule is also a consideration.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:15:25</b> England: That's all right.  You're getting some really
good geology there.  Don't feel bad.  (Pause)<p>

<b>124:15:39</b> Duke: Okay; we're making good time going back, and it's easier going up-Sun.  You can see the craters a lot better.  The
characteristics of the regolith are the same.<p>

<b>124:15:52</b> Young: Are you using the 16 (mm movie camera), Charlie?
<p>

<b>124:15:55</b> Duke: No.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie does not take any photos during the drive back to
Spook but does during the drive from Spook back to the LM.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>124:16:00</b> Young: Well, it ain't easier (driving) for me.  If I
wasn't following these tracks, it would be bad.  Up-Sun or down-Sun, it's
bad for driving.<p>

<b>124:16:06</b> England: Roger.  We figured it probably would be.<p>

<b>124:16:09</b> Duke: You're making great time, John.  We're doing 11
clicks.<p>

<b>124:16:13</b> England: Outstanding!<p>

<b>124:16:14</b> Duke: Super!<p>

<b>124:16:15</b> England: The Grand Prix driver is at it again. <p>

<b><a name="1241620">124:16:20</a></b> Duke: Barney Oldfield.<p>

<b>124:16:22</b> Young: I can follow a road.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;I'm afraid I'm a little too young to be
absolutely certain who Barney Oldfield was.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;He was a great race car driver back in the 20s or so. 
As a kid, I can remember everybody talked about Barney Oldfield.  I don't
even think he was driving when I was a kid.&quot;]<p>

[Journal contributor Brian Lawrence supplied the following information. 
&quot;Oldfield was born in 1878 and began driving for Henry Ford in 1902. 
Among other distinctions, he set a speed record of 131.275 mph over a
measured mile at Daytona, Florida, in a German Blitzen Benz on March 16,
1910.  He competed in the Indianapolis 500 twice (1914 and 1916) and
retired from racing in 1918.  Oldfield drove the Indy pace car in 1920 and
1922 and died in 1946.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:16:25</b> England: Back to the on-off switch mode.<p>

<b>124:16:30</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony)

<blockquote><i>[This is probably an inside joke, possibly a reference to
John's ability to change jobs - from Rover driver to geologist and back -
without a moment's pause.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:16:30</b> England: John, did you dust that TV lens?<p>

<b>124:16:35</b> Young: I dusted it somewhere.<p>

<b>124:16:38</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>124:16:40</b> Young: I don't remember if it was that station or not. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>124:16:47</b> England: Okay, I guess we'll need it dusted again at this
next stop.<p>

<b>124:16:52</b> Young: All righty.<p>

<b>124:16:56</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  As I look up-Sun here, going back
through (pause), you can see these lineations, mostly furrows, I'd call
them, with random orientation.  And they're definitely (due to) the Sun
casting shadows on unconsolidated regolith.<p>

<b>124:17:19</b> England: Right.<p>

<b>124:17:21</b> Duke: You can't believe how up and down this is, Tony.<p>

<b>124:17:26</b> England: How about when you're driving across rays?  You noticed any difference in the Rover tracks?<p>

<b>124:17:35</b> Young: (Chuckles)  I notice an increase in block
population.  But the tracks you can't see;  they're behind you.<p>

<b>124:17:42</b> England: Okay; I thought maybe you could see them behind the front wheel there.<p>

<b>124:17:49</b> Young: (Laughs)<p>

<b>124:17:52</b> Duke: It's a cloud of dust, Tony.<p>

<b>124:17:54</b> England: Okay; we copy.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>124:18:12</b> Young: (To Charlie) That's 
<a href="a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new">Spook</a>, isn't it?  That big one right there?<p>

<b>124:18:19</b> Duke: Yeah; I think it is.  (Probably indicating another
crater) That's the one we called Buster.  Okay.  We got to go up north if
you're gonna...(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[If, indeed, they are approaching Spook, they need to turn
northeast to park the Rover at a point on the rim of Spook nearest Buster.  See the Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3 
<a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="image" target="new">map</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>124:18:32</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  We're in a real blocky boulder field
here.  It's probably thrown out from Spook. What we originally called Spook
was not Spook.  I think this blocky one is Spook.  And we're coming up from the south side of it.

<blockquote><i>[As indicated below, they are probably northwest of Spook and south of Buster.  Charlie seems to be mistaking Buster for
Spook.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:18:52</b> Young: (Thinking about where he landed) Yeah, I'd say,
Houston, that I was farther past...I guess that I was farther past Double
Spot...(Pause)<p>

<b>124:19:07</b> Duke: But we got 0.8 mile (means 0.8 km), John, and Spook is supposed to be a mile (means 1 km) from the LM, as per the  map.  That's got to be it right down there.

<blockquote><i>[If they are 0.8 km from the 
<a href="a16-eva1names.jpg" title="image" target="new">LM</a>, which is near 
<a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">CB.1/80.6</a>,
and have been following their outbound tracks, they are south of Buster
near CA.7/76.6.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:19:15</b> Young: Buster?<p>

<b>124:19:16</b> Duke: No, that's Spook.<p>

<b>124:19:19</b> England: Okay...<p>

<b>124:19:20</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>124:19:20</b> England: ...Spook should look about the same size as
Flag.<p>

<b><a name="1241923">124:19:23</a></b> Duke: Nope; that doesn't.<p>

<b>124:19:25</b> Young: Does it look the same size?<p>

<b>124:19:29</b> Duke: No, this is the biggest crater right over here to
the right.<p>

<b>124:19:32</b> Young: Okay; well, this is Buster (on the left).<p>

<b>124:19:34</b> Duke: Okay, that's what I thought.  It's a blocky crater.

<blockquote><i>[Finally, they have it sorted out.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:19:36</b> Young: Let's stop the Rover halfway between them?<p>

<b>124:19:39</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>124:19:40</b> England: No, near the edge of Spook.<p>

<b>124:19:41</b> Duke: Buster is a lot bigger than...(Responding to
England)  Yeah, okay, it (meaning Buster)'s about 50 meters or so.  We're
bearing 089 for 0.8.<p>

<b>124:19:54</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[This readout puts them near 
<a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">CB.0/76.6</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>124:19:55</b> Duke: We're supposed to park 180 about halfway, John, (as per <a href="a16.lmpev124.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-24</a>).  Don't...We're in a big hole
back over here,  Could you...Go forward (lost under Tony)?<p>

<b>124:20:00</b> England: Little bit nearer to the end of Spook so we can see into Spook.<p>

<b>124:20:06</b> Duke: What you really want to see into is Buster.  Buster is about the same size as what we called Spook here.  In fact, it's a more impressive crater!<p>

<b>124:20:17</b> England: Okay, whatever turns you on, there.<p>

<b>124:20:19</b> Duke: John, that thing's...(Stops to listen) That, that's
got to be...Tony, is there a big crater to the south of...<p>

<b>124:20:29</b> Young: Spook?<p>

<b>124:20:30</b> Duke: Spook?<p>

<b>124:20:31</b> Young: Cove is.

<blockquote><i>[As shown in <a href="a16.lsp241.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 3.6.1-1</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures
volume, Cove is about 1 kilometer in diameter and about 2 kilometers
southwest of Spook.  Cove was one of John's landmarks at
pitchover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:20:33</b> England: That'd be quite a ways.  Red Rose looks about
like 0.8 kilometer.<p>

<b>124:20:44</b> Duke: No.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As is shown in the Descartes EVA-I, II 1 of
2 <a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">map</a>, Red Rose is a 200-m crater which is 0.8 km south of Spook at BW.2/76.5.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1242047">124:20:47</a></b> Duke: Okay; well, let's park here, John.  This is great
sampling.  We've got plenty of boulders and everything.<p>

<b>124:20:52</b> England: All right.  Let's do it right here.  We
concur.<p>

<b>124:20:59</b> Duke: Buster is a lot bigger than Plum is.  The one we
called Plum.<p>

<b>124:21:04</b> England: Right, it should be.<p>

<b>124:21:06</b> Young: Yeah, it sure is.

<blockquote><i>[See the Descartes EVA-I, III 1 of 3
<a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="image" target="new">map</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>124:21:10</b> Duke: Okay, then we got the right place then, if it should be.  Okay, we're stopped and  we're 180 (heading), 087 (bearing to the LM), 2.8 (km total distance driven), 0.8 (km from the LM), 115, 115, 72, 72, 100,100, off-scale low, off-scale low.<p>

<b>124:21:31</b> England: Okay, we copy.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[This <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">readout</a> puts them near CA.9/76.6.  Figure 6-29 from the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a> shows their actual location, which is very close to the planned stopping place at CA.7/76.7.  Clearly, the Rover Nav system is still giving very small errors.]</i></blockquote>
