<b>142:44:35</b> England: Okay, we understand your water flags are cleared.<p>

<b>142:44:40</b> Young: That's correct.<p>

<b>142:44:41</b> Duke: John's is;  mine's not quite, but I feel good cooling.  (Pause)<p>

<b>142:45:14</b> Duke: Okay, John.  You're doing great.  You got to come towards me a little bit.  There you go.  (Pause)  Okay, you've got to swing your rear end towards me.  There you go.  Now your PLSS is out the door.  Bend over a little bit, so you don't catch your harness (on the bottom of the DSKY).  There you go.  (Pause)  You're okay.<p>

<b>142:45:38</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)  Okay, Charlie.  Hand me the <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a>. <p>

<b>142:45:55</b> Duke: Okay.  Stand by.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie probably closes the hatch, moves to John's side of the cabin, re-opens the hatch, and pushes the jett bag out to John, who drops it to the surface.

<b>142:46:22</b> Young: Okay, give me...<p>

<b>142:46:24</b> Duke: I don't want to throw it too hard (through the

<b>142:47:06</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  What do you want to do with the (UV) camera?<p>

<b>142:47:09</b> England: Okay.  We'd like you to go over and describe to us where the Sun is with respect to the UV.<p>

<b>142:47:18</b> Young: I could have done that standing in the vehicle.<p>

<b>142:47:23</b> England: Well, we're going to have you move it back, but we just wanted the data before you move it.<p>

<b>142:47:35</b> Young: Charlie, watch out for the big rock in the
footpad.<p>

<b>142:47:38</b> Duke: Yeah, I know it.  I put it there.  That's Old

<b>142:48:00</b> Duke: Okay, mine are down.  Okay, Houston; I'm out on the porch. <p>

<b>142:48:07</b> England: Okay, Charlie.  (Pause)<p>

<b>142:48:11</b> Duke: Okay, got to go back and close the hatch.<p>

<b>142:48:15</b> Young: Okay, the Sun is just...At this setting, the Sun is slicing off about 2-1/2 to 3 inches of the...It's slicing off half of the spectroscope box.  You know what I mean?<p>

<b>142:48:40</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>142:48:41</b> Young: It slices right across there.<p>

<b>142:48:43</b> England: Okay, the Sun is on the film cassette, is that right?<p>

<b>142:48:48</b> Young: It is on the spectroscope.  The spectroscope box that hooks out.  It's the optical part.<p>

<b>142:49:01</b> England: Okay, we'd like you to move the UV camera in the east direction, directly east, so that it's 1 foot behind the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Z</a> pad. 
Reset before you move it.<p>

the old lunar terrain again.<p>

<b>142:49:33</b> England: Very good.<p>

<b>142:49:35</b> Young: Do a reset?<p>

<b>142:49:36</b> England: Okay, you do a reset and move the camera in the east direction until it's 1 foot behind (that is, east of) a line that goes north-south through the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Z</a> footpad.<p>

<b>142:50:59</b> Young: Houston, this really isn't too very good for me to do this because I can't get my backpack between it and the strut to operate it.  Did anybody try this in the real world?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is asking if Fred Haise or someone else got a suit and backpack on and tried to operate the camera this close to a LM mock-up.]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:51:22</b> England: Negative, John.  If you have to move it south a little bit, it's safe to move it to the edge of that shadow.<p>

<b>142:51:36</b> Young: Okay, let me do that.  (Pause)  Okay, it's
re-moding now.  We're going to lose whatever we're doing here.<p>

<b>142:51:53</b> England: Okay, that's fine.  We understand.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>142:52:33</b> Duke: (Adjusting the MESA height)  Hey, John, that's better.  I moved the MESA back down and, man, it's super nicer.  Don't have to fight the suits.  The SRC-1 is open.  Hey, what I'm going to do, Tony; I'm going to bring up the TV for you.<p>

<b>142:52:53</b> England: Okay, when you push in the circuit breakers, would you read us the battery temperatures?<p>

<b>142:53:01</b> Duke: Okay, all the breakers are going in.  And the battery temps are, one, 65, and the other is 82.  Correction...One, 70, and the other is 82.<p>

<b>142:53:27</b> Duke: Okay, what's next, for the TV?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has nothing to do until John finishes with the UV camera.  Charlie doesn't have the TV procedures on his checklist and didn't training for them on a regular basis.  He is asking Tony to talk him through the procedures.]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:53:32</b> England: Say again, Charlie.<p>

<b>142:53:36</b> Duke: What is the next switch setting for the TV?  It's not on my checklist.<p>

<b>142:53:46</b> England: Okay, <a href="../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="new">LCRU switch</a>, Mode 1 (PM1/NB).<p>

<b>142:53:53</b> Duke: Okay, go ahead.<p>

<b>142:54:06</b> Duke: Okay, go ahead.  (Pause)<p>

<b>142:54:13</b> Young: Okay, Houston, the (UV) camera is re-leveled.  Camera is re-leveled, Houston.<p>

<b>142:54:21</b> England: Okay, John, we'd like you to...<p>

<b>142:54:22</b> Young: Now, what else did he say about this?<p>

<b>142:54:23</b> England: John, we'd like you to aim it at the Earth.  The azimuth is 058 (roughly northwest), elevation is 75.<p>

<b>142:54:34</b> Young: Roger.  (Pause)<p>

<b>142:54:42</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, what else on the TV, please?<p>

<b>142:54:44</b> England: Okay, just go to Mode 3 on that and we'll leave it there.  And we'll control it from here.<p>

<b>142:54:50</b> Duke: Okay, will you have a picture?  (Hearing Tony)  Okay.<p>

<b>142:55:01</b> England: Okay, John, with that azimuth and elevation, look through the Earth sight and center it on the Earth, then give us the
azimuth you are reading and from that we'll calculate a new target.<p>

<b>142:55:20</b> Duke: Okay, y'all are just about dead center, Tony, in the high gain (antenna sighting scope).<p>

<b>142:55:26</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>142:55:32</b> Duke: You ought to be getting a picture.<p>

<blockquote><i>[The comm improves dramatically.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Charlie recommended that we put the (TV/HGA) alignment in both (cuff) checklists so that either guy could do it.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I had to interfere with John's conversation with Houston (at the start of the EVA) to get that going.  But it's a place to save time, because the LMP really doesn't have that much to do on the (LRV) load-up.  Get the cameras configured, and the film stowed, is about all.  So, it's good to have some kind of cross-talk within the checklists so you don't have to interfere with the other guy.  Apollo 17 probably won't have that problem with it since they don't have the UV (camera); but, sure enough, something will be there.  And, so, they really should have those TV and LRV power-up procedures in both checklists.&quot;]<p>

[Apollo 17 Commander Gene Cernan did not have any time-consuming tasks like the UV camera planned for the early parts of that mission's EVAs and the TV procedures were not included in LMP Jack Schmitt's cuff checklist.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;During the last few minutes, John was resetting the UV, you were resetting the TV and Tony was trying to give instructions to both of you, simultaneously.  Do you have any comments about this?  In the Apollo context, where seconds and minutes were precious, was ad-libbing a noticeable distraction?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, it was hard.  We kept stepping on one another,
comm-wise, at times.  You had to balance it out.  Normally, you wouldn't want to do that because you just want to stay with your checklist.  But John was supposed to power up the TV and I was supposed to get on with the rock boxes and stuff; but he had this problem with the UV camera.  And, so, I just decided to go turn on the television.  Normally, you wouldn't want to do that, because it is confusing.  Your stepping on one another and the CapCom's trying to talk to both of you and 'what'd you say' - especially when the comm's bad.  It wasn't a good idea all the time; but, in this case, instead of me just standing around twiddling my thumbs, I'm getting something done.  So, it was a balance; you had to make a decision whether to go ahead and do something or just stand there when the other guy has something else he's supposed to be doing that's out of the ordinary.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;With improvements in electronics since then, would it
make any sense, in the lunar base era, to have separate comm?  What do they do in the Shuttle?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't know.  They have one CapCom for the major operations, but there might be somebody in the science room.  And I think that's probably a good idea.  You know, you're probably going to have one frequency for the home base and another frequency for some group that's going out west and another group may be going south; so you'd want different comm for them and different people monitoring.  And then, like you do flying airplanes, you'd want some common emergency frequency that you could switch to and talk on that everybody's monitoring but nobody's talking on.  Military comm is like that.  You have a UHF radio that you're talking on one frequency, but you can receive on this emergency frequency or your regular frequency.  But then, to transmit, you've got to turn to the emergency frequency.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;But, to receive, you don't.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, you don't.  I think something like that would be pretty beneficial.  Of course, it depends on the scope of operations up there; but if you're going to stay for thirty days and have people running all over in different Rovers and stuff like that, you're going to need something.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Conceivably, one person back in Houston to talk to each individual, if necessary.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, well, I would probably say it's going to be somebody out on the lunar surface in the home base, maybe, talking.  It would be very expensive to keep Mission Control manned for six months or so, but I don't know.  You know, that's going to be a real big decision area: how are you going to manage this thing?  Are you going to do it all on the lunar surface or are you going to go back to Earth?&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And you certainly can't run it on a second-by-second basis when you're on the Mars missions.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

( <a href="a16a1425645.mp3" target="new">3 min 58 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>142:56:45</b> Young: Okay, Houston; the Earth is in the center and the (UV) camera's re-leveled.<p>

<b>142:56:56</b> England: Okay, would you read off the azimuth now?

<blockquote><i>[<a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> begins a clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:57:08</b> Young: Well, I left the azimuth on there and leveled the
camera and put the Earth in the center.  How's that?  Is that...<p>

<b>142:57:15</b> England: Okay, that sounds fine and the azimuth is 058.<p>

<b>142:57:21</b> Young: 058 and (an elevation of) 76.<p>

<b>142:57:25</b> England: Okay, then the first target will be 112 and 40.

<blockquote><i>[This target is roughly 20 degrees east of north and, because John is south of the ladder, it seems unlikely he will be able to see the target past the LM.]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:57:33</b> Young: 112 and 40.  (Pause)  You want to do a reset after we get to that target, right?<p>

<b>142:57:43</b> England: That would be fine.  And when you do a reset, verify the film advances and read the tempa-label for us.<p>

<b>142:57:54</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[A tempa-label is a patch with a series of spots which change from white to black at successively higher temperatures.

<b>142:58:00</b> Young: Roger.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As Fendell reaches the clockwise stop, we get a glimpse of John working with the UV camera near the ladder.  Charlie is at the back of the Rover and is unfolding an SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>142:58:30</b> Young: That's going to be pointing right at the lunar
module, Houston!<p>

<b>142:58:34</b> England: Okay, then move it to the left (counter-clockwise) until it is clear of it.<p>

<b>142:58:37</b> Young: (Garbled)  (hears Tony)  Oh.<p>

<b>142:58:43</b> England: Move it in azimuth.<p>

<b>142:58:52</b> Young: You want me to move it to the left until it's
clear, but I've got to take it out the other side of the vehicle.<p>

<b>142:58:57</b> England: Move it in azimuth.<p>

<b>142:58:58</b> Young: I got to take it to the north of the vehicle. <p>

<b>142:58:59</b> England: Not the camera.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie drops the bag, puts his left hand on the top of the Rover gate and bobs down to retrieve the bag.]</i></blockquote>

But lot of times (in training), though, things you thought of, like that, would result in a change in the procedures or a change to the equipment, because they always wanted to try to make it work right.

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;(During training) it
had been easy for us to deploy our antennas when we were on the surface but, once we were in one-sixth gravity, the only way that I could reach up to deploy Charlie's antenna was to have him come over and grab hold of something like the ladder or the Rover and bend over so I could get my hand up to it.  I just couldn't get a hand on it.  That took a little more time because we had to move over to a new position.  I don't think the communications would have been bad if we'd left the antennas stowed.  I ended up breaking one because we forgot to re-stow it (at the end of an EVA).  I'm not sure we shouldn't leave them stowed.&quot;]<p>

ladder.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:13:53</b> Duke: Boy, it sure looks different looking up-Sun.  (Pause)  You can still see those lineations in Stone Mountain, Tony.  In fact, they're maybe a little bit more pronounced (with the Sun higher than it was during EVA-1).<p>

<b><a name="1431418">143:14:18</a></b> Duke: Yeah.  Exactly the same angle.  Down at the bottom (of Stone Mountain), there aren't any.  They start in one place, that is, and it's a little ridge that's to the east of Cinco, down at the base;  what we call the base here.  There's two pretty predominant craters over there.  Right there, there aren't any.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell zooms in on John and manages to keep him in view as he bobs down to grab the sample in his right hand.  He has a sample bag in his left hand.

<b>143:17:58</b> Young: I think that's what I'm doing.  (Pause)<p>

<b>143:18:03</b> Duke: Ah, the old lunar surface.  We've really kicked this stuff up, Tony, right around the lunar module where we walked.  Where you don't have the footprints and the (Rover) tracks, it's very smooth, very white albedo...<p>

<b>143:18:18</b> Young: Charlie, could you bend over?<p>

<b>143:18:20</b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie bends at the waist about 30 degrees.  John needs to fasten the bottom of the bag to the PLSS.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:18:21</b> Duke: Very white albedo.  Where we've kicked it up, it's about two shades grayer.  It's a lot darker albedo.  (Pause)  And you know why I think that is, Tony?  You look down-Sun, and it's not that way.  You look up-Sun, and it is.  I think it's the shadows that the Sun casts on the particles that have been disturbed that causes it to give a darker albedo.<p>

<b>143:18:55</b> England: Good observation.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The only problem with Charlie's hypothesis is that
disturbed soil is darker only near the LM.  As shown in photos taken from the Command Module, the soil around the LM is lighter than the normal surface.  Although the precise mechanism that causes the surface to be more reflective isn't known, it is undoubtedly caused by the Descent Engine plume during the landing.  When the astronauts disturb the surface near the LM, it returns to its normal color.  Down-Sun photos taken on various missions show darkened soil in that direction.  See, for example, AS17-140<a href="../a17/images17.html#21355" target="new">21355</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:19:01</b> Young: Okay, Charlie.  I got you.<p>

SCB on the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:19:12</b> Young: Open it.<p>

<b>143:19:13</b> Duke: I couldn't...I did.  I couldn't get it off a minute
ago.  I mean I couldn't get it on a minute ago.

<b>143:19:18</b> Duke: There we go.

<b>143:20:05</b> Duke: Hold still, John.  This thing (probably the Velcro patch that holds the loose end of the bottom strap that attaches to a mating patch sewn on the bottom of the PLSS) keeps coming off.<p>

<b>143:20:08</b> Young: In fact, the azimuth setting seems to be getting tighter and tighter.  I don't understand that but, you know, that's what it seems to be doing.  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1432024">143:20:24</a></b> Duke: Dadgum thing!  (Pause)  You know, if there was just a patch of Velcro on these bags (pause) and one on your PLSS, you wouldn't have to worry with that strap.<p>

<a href="a16.eva2prep.html#1424000" target="new">142:40:00</a> and, in 40 minutes, John's oxygen reading has dropped from 92 percent to 84 percent.  Extrapolation of that use rate would imply a 7 hour 40 minute capability.  According to the Apollo 16 Mission Report, John started the EVA with 1.81 pounds of oxygen and consumed 1.22 pounds in 444 minutes and, in a typical 40 minutes, he used 11 percent of his initial charge.  Consequently, he could be expected to have 89 percent of 92 percent - that is, 82 percent - remaining.  Given uncertainties in gauge performance and expected variations in use rate with work load, his present reading of 84 is entirely reasonable.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:25:53</b> Young: That's how you want to do that, isn't it, Tony?<p>

<b>143:25:58</b> England: Say again, John?<p>

<b>143:26:03</b> Young: Okay.  You don't need a Sun alignment or any of that stuff, do you?<p>

<b>143:26:11</b> England: Yes, we do, John.  We need the Sun alignment, and go to Reset.<p>

<b>143:26:18</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>143:26:31</b> England: And John, do you remember what the exact heading was where you were parked?<p>

<b>143:26:32</b> Duke: Oh, I'm in the machine!<p>

<b>143:26:37</b> Young: (Laughing)  I'm parked there now.  It was 358 or whatever it's reading on there.<p>

<b>143:26:43</b> England: Okay; fine.<p>

<b>143:26:44</b> Young: Don't you guys remember?  I read it out to you.<p>

<b>143:26:46</b> England: All right.  You just read north.<p>

<b>143:26:48</b> Young: You want to start from here, or do you want to
turn...(Stops to listen)  Okay.<p>

<b>143:26:56</b> Duke: We've got to get headed west for a Nav update,
John.<p>

<b>143:26:59</b> Young: Okay; and that's what we're gonna do.  (Pause) 
Still works!<p>

<b>143:27:10</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>143:27:17</b> Duke: We're under way.<p>

<b>143:27:21</b> Young: Okay, do you want a Nav update from here now, or don't you?<p>

<b>143:27:24</b> England: Yes, we do, sir.<p>

<b>143:27:26</b> Duke: We've got to get it.<p>

<b>143:27:28</b> Young: Okay.  Whoa, horse.<p>

<b>143:27:34</b> England: And while you're there, we'll need a complete LRV readout.<p>

<b>143:27:40</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  It (meaning the Sun Shadow
Device)'s reading 1 degree to the left, the Sun is. (See pre-flight <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">console photo</a>.) And we're heading of
268; bearing is 000; distance, 00; range 00, of course.  And we are pitched 4 degrees down.  (Pause as he flips the indicator to show the roll scale) And we are rolled 1 degree right - because Charlie's heavy today.<p>

<b>143:28:10</b> Duke: You rat!  (Pause)  That's why I didn't see that
secondary from out here on the ground.  You can't see the...The rocks are
buried from...<p>

<b>143:28:21</b> Young: Look at the rocks around there, Charlie.<p>

<b>143:28:24</b> Duke: I know it.<p>

<b>143:28:26</b> Young: There's your basalts and things.  Those are black. They're probably glass covered, don't you think?<p>

<b>143:28:31</b> Duke: They are.  I picked up one out there.  See where my footprints go?<p>

<b>143:28:35</b> England: Okay.  Torque to 264, and could we have the rest of the numbers on the LRV?<p>

<b>143:28:42</b> Duke: Okay.  Stand by.  (Pause)<p>

( <a href="a16a1432848.mp3" target="new">2 min 40 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>143:28:48</b> Young: Okay.  264.<p>

<b>143:28:50</b> Duke: Okay, we got 114 and 114.  Make that 108 and 108. Off-scale low, off-scale low on the Amps.  Volts are 68, 68.  Batteries are 82 and 100 and...Now they're up to 80 and 60...Oh, wait a minute.  80 and 95.  Motors are off-scale low all of them.<p>

<b>143:29:21</b> Young: Hey, Hous...Houston.  The LCRU covers are supposed to be 100 percent open at this point, ain't they?<p>

<b>143:29:28</b> England: That's correct.<p>

<b>143:29:29</b> Young: I'd better get off and open that rascal.<p>

<b>143:29:32</b> Duke: Okay.  (Long Pause while John tries to unfasten his <a href="a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new">seatbelt</a>)  Want me to do it, John?<p>

<b>143:30:04</b> Young: Yeah.  I guess you'd better, Charlie.  I can't seem to unfasten this rascal again.  (Pause)  I got it.  I got it.<p>

<b>143:30:12</b> Duke: I got it already.  I'm gonna...I'm gonna do it.  (Pause)  Aow!  (Pause)<p>

<b>143:30:35</b> Young: Watch it, Charlie.<p>

<b>143:30:37</b> Duke: Am I hitting the (high-gain) antenna?<p>

<b>143:30:38</b> Young: Yep.<p>

<b>143:30:39</b> Duke: I was afraid of that.

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;My PLSS antenna was getting tangled up in the high-gain antenna.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:30:40</b> Young: Sticking your PLSS thing through it.  (Both laugh; Pause)<p>

<b>143:30:51</b> Duke: (Probably getting ready to jump into his seat)  Ah, here we go.  Watch this.  Oh, my pencil fell off, but that's okay
(garbled).<p>

<b>143:30:59</b> Young: (Joking)  Suppose you need that pencil.<p>

<b>143:31:01</b> Duke: Yeah.  I can't even see the maps, much less the
pencil.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;So you had a pencil - or a pen - in the
suit?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Right up here (on the left sleeve).&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;What sorts of things  did they imagine you writing
down?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember.  (Laughing)  Probably things like
changes in the maps and those kind of things.  You know, we'd write on the
maps  That's the only thing I can think of;  but we had a pencil with
us.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I don't </i>ever<i> remember anybody using
one.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.   We didn't.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Do you remember using one during training - marking
maps and whatever?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Nope&quot;]<p>

[It was much easier to ask CapCom to take a note for later reference than to get the pencil out and write something down.]</i></blockquote>

<b>143:31:06</b> Young: Looks like you're in pretty good shape.<p>

<b>143:31:08</b> Duke: We need a map holder like a windshield wiper.  You can power up, I'm...Wait a minute.  Okay.  Hooked.  Let's go.<p>

<b><a name="1433116">143:31:16</a></b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The map
holder is worthless.  You get in there with a 16-mm camera, your
Hasselblad, and your knee.  By the time you get in, you're pushing the map
holder out of the way.  It's sitting up there and you can't see the maps. 
What I ended up doing was taking one with the headings and topography on it - the 1/25,000 (for example, <a href="a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 3.6.2-2</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures
volume) - and I wedged it between the 16-mm camera and the staff.  That's a great place for the map because you can look up at it and see it.  You can reach up and pull it out if you have to and just push it right back and wedge it in place.  Unfortunately, our maps and photographs didn't look anything like the topography.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;No resemblance to
where we were.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The Rover Nav as
working so good; and we could see our landmarks.  So, we had no trouble
navigating.  We really didn't need the maps; but, where they were stowed,
they were useless.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
