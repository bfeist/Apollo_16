<blockquote><i>[John is near the RTG and has his back to us. He is working with the geophone equipment. Charlie heads out to join John but, after skipping through the soft-rimmed crater north of the Rover, stops for a second to look at the soil he has disturbed. He then continues on his way.

<b>121:54:46</b> Duke: Tony, on the rim of that little crater, as I walked through there, there was a...Underneath the regolith there was a white area. I kicked up some very white soil, about 3 centimeters down. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[White soil was found at various places by most of the crews and, here, it probably represents a layer of fine ejecta from South Ray Crater. The light color is due to the fact that the South Ray impact shocked the material near the impact point and created countless, highly reflective, angular fragments. In the time since the ejecta was laid down, micrometeorites have hit the top layer and each impact has produced a small puddle of brownish glass, gradually returning the top layer to the normal color.]<p>

[Charlie goes east around the PSE to avoid getting dust on anything. John is putting the geophone anchor in the ground about eight feet north of the Central Station, as per <a href="a16.lsp057.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-26 and CDR-27</a>. The anchor will ensure that, should John put any tension in the geophone cables, the Central Station will not move. In AS16-113-
<a href="images16.html#18347" target="new">18347</a>, the anchor is the object to the right of the Central Station with arrow-like fins.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:55:09</b> Duke: Oh, I forgot the camera.<p>

<b>121:55:10</b> England: Roger.<p>

<b>121:55:12</b> Duke: (Garbled)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie was supposed to bring a camera out from the Rover. Neither of them is wearing a camera for the simple reason that the cameras protrude out nearly a foot and would get in the way during the instrument deployment and drilling. Here, Charlie needs a camera to document the deployment of the geophone line.]<p>

[John may be looping the geophone cables around the bottom of the anchor.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:55:15</b> Young: Okay, Charlie. I got it.<p>

<b>121:55:17</b> Duke: (Garbled). Okay.<p>

<b>121:55:19</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John sticks the tip of the anchor in the ground and Charlie moves in to push it in.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:55:20</b> Duke: I'll get it; let me have it.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie jumps up enough that he can scoot his feet behind him and put his full weight on the anchor. It sinks a foot or so into the ground.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:55:24</b> Young: (Concerned about cable damage) Whoa, Charlie!!!<p>

<b>121:55:25</b> Duke: Huh? How's that?

<blockquote><i>[As Charlie gets up, his heels nudge the mortar cables which are strung out behind him.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:55:29</b> Young: Watch out for those cables behind you.<p>

<b>121:55:30</b> Duke: Okay. I am.<p>

<b>121:55:36</b> Young: (Chuckles as he examines the anchor) That's pretty good.<p>

<b>121:55:39</b> Duke: Okay, Tony. I stuffed the geophone stake in, by just pushing on it about, oh, a...about a foot. Y'all better think about that two-tenths cone penetration at Stop 10. It looks like the five(-tenths cone) would be the best, all the way out. I think I'll just go right up to the hilt with the two.<p>

<b>121:56:10</b> England: Okay. We copy.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is referring to the penetrometer experiment, a long rod with interchangeable conical tips. When using the penetrometer, he pushes the instrument into the soil and a built-in sensor measures the penetration depth and the force used. Figure <a href="a16psrf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new">8-1</a> from the Apollo 16 <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a> shows the penetrometer and attachments. The three cones in the figure have base areas - perpendicular to the penetration axis - of 1.29, 3.22 and 6.44 square centimeters. According to the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, only the two smaller cones were flown and Charlie's 'two-tenths' refers to the 1.29-square-centimeter cone and 'five tenths' refers to the 3.22. Journal Contributor Keith Hearn notes that 1.29 cm<sup>2</sup> = 0.2 in<sup>2</sup> and  3.22 cm<sup>2</sup> = 0.5 in<sup>2</sup>. Station 10 is a stop planned at the end of EVA-2 when John and Charlie are almost back to the LM. EVA-2 cuff checklist pages LMP-18 and LMP-19 show the penetrometer activities planned for Station 10.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;They had three or four sizes of cones for the head of the thing. The smallest was that 'two' and my fear was that, if I put that on, it was going to go into the ground all the way - (maximum penetration possible is 76 cm) - and not give us a good reading. In fact, later on here (during EVA-2), you'll see one time I did push on one and it did go all the way in and I fell down.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Had you already done enough pushing of the geophone stake and the penetrometer to get a feel for that?&quot;]<p>

[I was thinking about training, but didn't ask the question well. Charlie thought I was asking about his EVA activities up to this point.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, apparently. Not the penetrometer - we hadn't used that yet - but the geophone stakes and the other things we were pushing in. You know, the heat flow (drill stem), the first one; I could push it in three or four centimeters. It just felt soft to me.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:56:15</b> Young: Watch out, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[John has picked up the thumper assembly. Apparently, Charlie has gotten close enough to the geophone cable to concern John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:56:16</b> Duke: Okay. I was just waiting to get the dumb heat thing. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John and Charlie are working with the thumper assembly, releasing the first of three geophones which Charlie will plant in the ground near the Central Station as per <a href="a16.lmpev117.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-17</a>, <a href="a16.lsp057.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-26, and CDR-27</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>121:56:30</b> Young: There.<p>

<b>121:56:31</b> Duke: John, things just stand up...The wires (and) everything just stands up off the ground about 6 inches here.<p>

<b>121:56:40</b> Young: I know it. Never thought of that. We should have (garbled)...We never thought of that. (Pause)<p>

<b>121:56:50</b> Duke: Okay. I got it. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has taken the geophone from John.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:02</b> Duke: This is gonna be the trick of the week.

<blockquote><i>[The conical geophone is attached to the cable and, holding the cable in both hands, Charlie lowers the geophone to the ground, point first. He then steps on the top of the geophone, apparently pushing it straight in.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:07</b> Young: You did it, Charlie. Not only has he gotten the geophone in the ground, he's got it buried in the ground.<p>

<b>121:57:13</b> Duke: Super! Okay. This is going to be a lot easier than carrying that big...other backpack.

<blockquote><i>[This is some kind of training reference, perhaps to an early deployment system.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:24</b> Young: Keep an eye on this, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[John is positioning himself so that he can walk west, away from the anchor, with the cable reel outside his right hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:26</b> Duke: I got you. I got you.<p>

<b>121:57:27</b> Young: Okay. Now I'm going out and parallel these (Rover) tracks.<p>

<b>121:57:29</b> Duke: Okay. Let me make sure (the cable loops in the anchor don't slip in tension, as per the reminder on 
<a href="a16.lsp057.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-27</a>.)<p>

<b>121:57:30</b> Young: You want the hammer?

<blockquote><i>[John has the hammer in a pocket on his right shin and wants to know if Charlie will need to use it to emplace a stake at the second geophone site.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:31</b> Duke: No, go ahead. I just want to...<p>

<b>121:57:34</b> Young: You don't need the hammer; we don't need the hammer.<p>

<b>121:57:35</b> Duke: I know it.<p>

<b>121:57:36</b> Young: The other stake is over there.<p>

<b>121:57:37</b> Duke: Oh, okay. Near the pallet?<p>

<b>121:57:40</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>121:57:41</b> Duke: Okay. I'll get it. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[This is a second anchor that they will use to secure the cable after they deploy the second geophone 150 feet from the first.]<p>

[John starts walking west along the Rover tracks. He move slowly and deliberately to avoid jerking the cable.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:45</b> Duke: Sounds like the (Far UV) camera re-moding.<p>

<b>121:57:47</b> Young: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[As John noted at <a href="a16.lrvload.html#1195806" target="new">119:58:06</a>, the UV camera emits an incidental VHF radio signal when it re-modes. John and Charlie's OPS antennas pick up that signal and, consequently, they can hear the camera in operation.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:51</b> Young: Make sure that it's not pulling too hard on that wire back there.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie was watching John but turns to look at the first geophone.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:57:53</b> Duke: No; it's great, John.<p>

<b>121:57:55</b> England: Yeah, Charlie. I think you need a (Hasselblad) camera (to document the geophone deployment).<p>

<b>121:57:59</b> Duke: Yeah, I'm going to get one. I'll go run get it now.<p>

<b>121:58:02</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie starts for the Rover. <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom and then pans left to follow John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:58:03</b> Young: No, Charlie! Watch (me) and see where this line comes out.<p>

<b>121:58:06</b> Duke: Okay. (To Houston) I'd better do that, Tony. I'll get the camera (later).<p>

<b>121:58:09</b> England: Okay. Fine.<p>

<b>121:58:11</b> Duke: (To Houston) (Wait) just a minute. Okay?<p>

<b>121:58:12</b> England: No hurry.<p>

<b>121:58:15</b> Duke: We know we need a...(Hearing Tony) Okay. (To John) You're walking a little bit sideways, John; you're pulling against it with your left side. There you go. Looking good, John. The geophone's still in, and the stake is looking good. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie runs to catch up with John, this time using a loping, foot-to-foot stride.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:58:48</b> Duke: Going great. (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie switches to his sideways skip, leading with his left foot.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:59:02</b> Young: Trouble is, the average guy doesn't realize how far 100 meters is.<p>

<b>121:59:07</b> Duke: I know it.<p>

<b>121:59:09</b> Young: Especially me.<p>

<b>121:59:12</b> England: (Exaggerating) Roger; 2 inches at a time like that, it's a long way. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is walking slowly, but not that slowly. In one 45-second interval, he takes about 40 steps. He is walking, flat-footed, with a wide stance, and covers about 15 meters in that interval.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:59:19</b> Duke: Ah, the footprints on the Moon! Can't believe it!<p>

<b>121:59:24</b> England: Ah, that's all right. They'll probably erode away in about 4 billion years.

<blockquote><i>[They have gone over a small ridge and John's feet are no longer visible.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:59:28</b> Duke: The regolith...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>121:59:31</b> Young: What's that, Charlie?<p>

<b>121:59:33</b> Duke: What's what?<p>

<b>121:59:34</b> Young: That thing hanging up there.<p>

<b>121:59:35</b> Duke: No, it's okay. (Looking back) Man, that's a long way, John! Stake is still up (near the Central Station).<p>

<b>121:59:44</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>121:59:45</b> Duke: Keep going. Okay, there's a double one. <p>

<b>121:59:46</b> Young: There's a double one.

<blockquote><i>[This may be a warning mark on the cable that tells them they are nearly 150 feet (45 meters) from the anchor. The cable section containing the second geophone is about to come off the reel.]</i></blockquote>

<b>121:59:47</b> Duke: There's a double one. (I'll) run around, and get in front of you here. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie runs around John's left side, goes in front and ends up on John's right so that he can free the geophone. John and Charlie are now far enough down the far side of the ridge that we can no longer see their knees.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:00:01</b> Young: There they come.<p>

<b>122:00:02</b> Duke: There they come.<p>

<b>122:00:03</b> Young: Here we are!

<blockquote><i>[John stops. It took him about 130 seconds to walk 45 meters and his average speed was about 1.2 km/hour. For comparison, typical running speeds achieved by the astronauts when they are unencumbered are 5 to 6 km/hour.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:00:04</b> Duke: Okay, here we are. (Pause)<p>

<b>122:00:09</b> Young: Agh. (Pause)<p>

<b>122:00:16</b> Duke: (Garbled) Got it. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John frees the second geophone and Charlie lowers it to the ground.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:00:24</b> Duke: Wait a minute.<p>

<b>122:00:26</b> Young: Okay. That's right, we have to put that (geophone) in before we put the stake (a second anchor) in.<p>

<b>122:00:29</b> Duke: Yeah, I can't do anything till I get that in. (Pause) (Talking to the geophone) Come on. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Although we can't see exactly what is going on, Charlie is probably having trouble keeping the geophone vertical.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:00:49</b> Duke: Guess what?

<blockquote><i>[Just before Charlie's next transmissions, his upper body movements indicate that he finally steps on the geophone and gets it planted.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:00:50</b> Young: Beautiful, Charlie. (Pause)<p>

<b>122:00:55</b> Duke: Okay, that one's buried too, Tony.<p>

<b>122:00:58</b> Young: Charlie buries the geophones. <p>

<b>122:01:01</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is positioning the second anchor.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>122:01:03</b> Duke: Pull it out this way.<p>

<b>122:01:04</b> Young: It pulled out this way.<p>

<b>122:01:05</b> Young: No, that's right.<p>

<b>122:01:06</b> Duke: No, you want it this way, don't you?<p>

<b>122:01:07</b> Young: No, that's right. That's right. <p>

<b>122:01:08</b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Once again, Charlie jumps up to get his feet back and pushes the anchor a foot or more into the ground.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:01:11</b> Young: (Concerned) Not so hard!!<p>

<b>122:01:12</b> Duke: Why?<p>

<b>122:01:13</b> Young: Liable to cut the line.<p>

<b>122:01:14</b> Duke: Oh no; it's all right. You're right about that...We're all right.<p>

<b>122:01:20</b> Young: Get the flag open, so we can see it.

<blockquote><i>[John may be referring to fins like those on the top of the first anchor. Their primary purpose may be to make the anchor easily visible in documentary photographs. See AS16-113-
<a href="images16.html#18347" target="new">18347</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>122:01:21</b> Duke: Yeah. Sorry. Okay. I'm going to get a camera. You all set?<p>

<b>122:01:25</b> Young: Yep.

<blockquote><i>[John positions himself to resume the cable deployment.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:01:26</b> Duke: Watch out. You got it crooked, John. Whoop. Right here on this side, your right (side). (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie frees the snag he noticed.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:01:34</b> Young: Yeah, okay.<p>

<b>122:01:35</b> Duke: Okay; there you go.<p>

<b>122:01:36</b> Young: Thank you.<p>

<b>122:01:37</b> Duke: Yes, sir. About to get it again. There you go. Okay. The stake's holding fine. (Pause) Adios.<p>

<b>122:01:48</b> Young: Adios. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie heads for the Rover. He is off-camera most of the time but, during two brief glimpses we get of him, he is using the foot-to-foot, loping stride.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;If I wasn't carrying anything and it was fairly level, I'd just usually run normally.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:01:57</b> Young: It's a far cry from that...(Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1220203">122:02:03</a></b> Duke: Hey, John. You got to wait. They got to change out your air hose.<p>

<b>122:02:07</b> Young: (In mock annoyance) Charlie.<p>

<b>122:02:09</b> Duke: Where's the...Hey, Tony, where is the Bendix air compressors?<p>

<b>122:02:14</b> England: It doesn't look right with them not out there. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[During training, John and Charlie could not have worn or used functional PLSSs. The real PLSSs were far to heavy and, as well, the cooling system would only operate in a vacuum. Instead, they wore lightweight PLSS mock-ups and got oxygen and cooling water through hoses which were handled by support personnel who followed them around to keep the hoses out of the way.  Training photo <a href="images16.html#72H100" target="new">72-H-100h</a> shows the air compressors and tanks.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I take it that this is a training reference.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;We had the cooling water guy and one with an oxygen hose and they just followed us around. They had different lengths of hoses so that they could get farther away from us.&quot;]<p>

[NASA photo <a href="ap16-KSC-72PC-141.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-72PC-141</a> shows John Young (left) on 31 March 1972 as he prepares to collect a sample with the Contact Soil Sampler, a task discussed at <a href="a16.sta9.html#1475647" target="new">147:56:47</a>. The tech on the left side of the picture is holding John's cooling water hose (black). Behind John, we can see the shadow of another tech handling John's air hose and comm cable. Charlie's three cables/hoses go out the picture to the right.]<p>

[After a while, all we see is the top of John's PLSS.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;That's really a deep hole!&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah; it's a big ridge. We're sort of up on a ridge and it's going down. You really can't tell it, just looking out can you?&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Those little rocks on the edge of it help a little bit.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:02:23</b> Duke: I'll tell you this one-sixth gravity feels a lot better (than training in one g in Florida).  (Pause)  Tony, when I first started with that jack, the ground was so soft, I thought the thing had failed like it did in the last training, but it had not. It just worked great.<p>

<b>122:02:43</b> England: Outstanding. (Pause)<p>

<b>122:02:52</b> Duke: How about that (running) pace, huh? (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The distance from the second geophone to the Rover is about 70 meters and, although we don't actually see Charlie arrive at the back of the Rover, we get glimpses of his shadow which suggest that the trip took no more than 1 minute 10 seconds. His running speed, therefore, was about 3.6 km/hr. By Apollo standards, this is a leisurely pace; but, of course, it is still early in the first EVA. Charlie's efficiency will improve.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1220321">122:03:21</a></b> Duke: Gummit! (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The TV picture shakes as Charlie works around the Rover. As we will hear in a moment, he has found the locking pin from John's purge valve on the ground next to the Commander's seat. The amplitude of the TV motions suggest that he may be leaning on the Rover as he goes down to get the pin. Fendell pans right and stops when the Central Station is in view. One end of the deep core is visible at the right side of the picture. It is lying across the back of the Rover, secured in the vise on the top of the geopallet.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:03:29</b> Young: Well, I'll say one thing: the force to deploy this thing, I can sense, is exactly the same as it was in one g. And I keep wondering when the power wire is going to bust (from the tension in it). (Pause)<p>

<b>122:03:46</b> Duke: Okay, Tony. I have LMP's camera. <p>

<b>122:03:50</b> England: Okay. (Pause)<p>

<b>122:04:01</b> Duke: The back of...The bottom of the bit is (capped) with Bravo. And I'm going back out and take some pictures.<p>

<b>122:04:11</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stops briefly to make sure that he had, indeed, put cap Bravo on the bit end of the deep core.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:04:12</b> Duke: John has disappeared over the horizon!! (Pause)<p>

<b>122:04:22</b> Duke: John, how about an EMU status check? You pulled out your pin on your purge valve.<p>

<b>122:04:23</b> Young: I'm doing okay. 70...(Counting marks on the pressure gauge) 50, 60, 73 percent is what I read.

<blockquote><i>[The next four minutes of video is missing from the tape Ken Glover is currently using to create RealVideo files for the ALSJ.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:04:47</b> Duke: Okay. Well, you still must be locked. Your pin's out. I picked it up, and it's under your seat.<p>

<b>122:04:54</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>122:04:55</b> Duke: (It was) right next to the Rover.<p>

<b>122:04:56</b> Young: Well, we'll get it.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;If you need to open the purge valve and you pull the pin, do you then actually do something mechanically to the valve to get it flowing?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah. And I'm not sure exactly what you had to do. I think you had to twist it one way or the other.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So the chances of starting to lose oxygen out of the suit if the pin fell out were (slight)...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh. The pin was just a safety, like most all pins. You pulled the pin out and then you had to make an action of turning it or pulling it - I've forgotten. You had to take a distinct action; but I suppose there was a possibility of brushing up against something and you could twist it or pop it and you could start flowing (oxygen) out. Your suit would make it up, but you'd be using quantity out real fast and it would shorten the EVA. So I asked John to check his EMU and make sure the purge valve wasn't popped open and he wasn't losing O2.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Because you found the pin next to his seat, I suppose it probably came out when he was getting on or off the Rover.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Apparently so. It might have hung up on the seatbelt, probably.&quot;]<p>

[See the dialog at <a href="#1222634" target="new">122:26:34</a>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And your first thought, when you found it, was to have him check (his pressure gauge and oxygen quantity)...&quot;]<p>

<blockquote><i>[As per <a href="a16.lsp059.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-28</a>, the experimenters need to have John and Charlie stand still for ten seconds before John fires each shot. This prevents confusion of the thumper signal with signals generated by footfalls. John places the thumper firmly on the ground and, after ten seconds of quiet, selects the next initiator - in this case, the first one - rotates the arm switch, counts four seconds, and depresses the fire switch.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[As we can see after the TV resumes, the thumper jumps in reaction to the charge detonation and kicks up a small cloud of dust.

[Jones - &quot;Did John fire the thumper in the training exercises?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;The training model didn't fire; I mean, they didn't load it up. I believe he fired the flight one - or maybe the backup flight one - once. He actually fired the thing. And, of course, this time he's firing it. He could feel it. It'd hit and it would splash out a little dust on the side. I could look down and see that; but I couldn't feel it in my feet.&quot;]<p>

At the lower right, note the bright, orange-colored patch of sunlight reflected off the Central Station's Mylar curtain. ]<p>

[Duke - &quot;<a href="images16.html#18348" target="new">18348</a> is looking to the north. Smoky Mountain's in the background, in the upper center of the picture. There's a big boulder in the near background. This is a picture of the Central Station and you can see the spaghetti. The cable off to the left goes to the RTG. It was more of a round cable. But the flat cables that go to the various experiments, you can see, were coiled up like spaghetti on the lunar surface. That was what we had complained about before the mission - that we might have a problem with those things - because we saw that, occasionally, in the one-sixth-gravity training in the airplane.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;We didn't see it out on the training site in one g; the stuff was used so much in training that it didn't have a set in it like these cables. You know, these things had never been unwound before and had just set in its coil. And so, when you tried to undo 'em, they just tended to curl up.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;The stuff you used in training, could you coil it up and then put it out and it would...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It would lay flat. So John could just step over it. But, up on the Moon, you tended to shuffle. In one-sixth gravity, you tended to shuffle more than you did down on the Earth. In training, the suits were sort of lumbery, so you just sort of stepped and you had real definite steps; but up on the Moon, you tended to shuffle a lot. You didn't get your feet up in the air as much; and that's why John got all tangled up and, unfortunately, ripped off the heat flow. You can see one of the connectors here. In fact, just to the right of the RTG connector is where the heat flow cable had been connected.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Charlie moves in to the Central Station, probably to take a look at the heat flow cable. This is what is on Houston's mind, too.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:10:08</b> Duke: Go ahead.<p>

<b>122:10:10</b> England: We would like for you to look at the end of that heat flow cable that was broken off and tell us how far from the heat central station it broke, and also describe the end of the broken cable. If you can get that in between (shots), when John's walking.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie drops to his knees so that he can pick up the end of the cable.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;When you grabbed the cable, did you take the connector off the Central Station?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No. The connector was sort of locked on. It was latched on pre-flight and, as far as I know, we couldn't get it off without a screwdriver or a pair of pliers or something to get it unlocked. So I just looked at it and I saw that it had broken off right flush with the connector. The connector was a wide connector and that flat wire just sort of slipped in. And the connector was clamped on both sides and how...&quot;]<p>

[&quot;We could have probably fixed it, but we would've had to have taken the connector off. We would've had to pick up all the electronics and the heat flow probes and everything and haul all that back into the Lunar Module. And getting all that folded up...We probably could have stuffed into the ETB or something like that; but they decided that it was going to take us too long. They decided that you could scrape and get an abrasive surface to get a better contact and we could stick it in there. (Backup Commander) Fred Haise demonstrated it, and we probably could have done it; but it was too long (a job), so they decided just to abandon ship.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So Fred and others had tried to work the problem?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah. They were our backup; and, when you had problems like that everybody in mission control got to work, especially the people that were interested in this. So they'd corral the backup crew and the engineers and the Principle Investigator and the Bendix folks - who made this ALSEP - and see if they could work out a procedure to fix it. And they probably developed something. They never did radio it up to us because they decide it was going to take too long.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Rather like what you did for the 17 crew when their fender came off.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Right.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

[Jones - &quot;Did you have film in the camera.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah. Uh-huh. And then they would develop it and we would look at it to see how we screwed up and if we were in focus and make sure the horizon was right.

[Jones - &quot;There's some nice, deep footprints on the rim of that crater you were talking about. Just over the drill.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I remarked about that; it was real soft in that area. And you can see the Rover in the background. And it was parked basically facing south. I think 195 degrees was the heading and the (TV) camera's looking at us taking a picture. To me, the ground looks like what I call 'freshly plowed' and it just looked like it had been rained on. You can see where the unspoiled surface was. And you see, when you step on it, it makes it a brighter albedo. Why that is, I don't know. The surface was fairly unconsolidated in this area. Later on, when we looked at the core, it had, you know, various sizes of grains; but it was all mostly fines. As you stepped on it, you never sank in more than an inch or two in this area. You can see the footprints.&quot;]<p>

[Frames <a href="images16.html#18368" target="new">18368</a> and <a href="images16.html#18369" target="new">18369</a> show the western heat flow hole.]<p>

[Charlie completes the pan with 
<a href="images16.html#18370" target="new">18370</a>, which shows the magnetometer at the right side.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;In 
<a href="images16.html#18368" target="new">18368</a>, we're looking off towards South Ray Crater which would be the southwest of our position. You could see, off in the distance, right below the horizon, is South Ray Crater. It's the lighter area. Most of the surface around here is undisturbed. I had drilled one hole in; and that's on the right.&quot;]<p>

<b>122:14:50</b> Young: Houston, do you want...Answer me, do you want me to do one by the geophone, or do I skip that one? The central geophone. There's a white thing by it.

<blockquote><i>[The 'white thing' may be one of a series of markers attached to the cable at 15-foot intervals to show John where to do the shots.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:15:02</b> England: The one right by the central geophone; yes, we do want.<p>

<b>122:15:08</b> Young: Okay.<p>

[Jones - &quot;This cable coming off the RTG is sitting well up off the ground and one can see the waves and wiggles even in these ribbon cables.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;And you can see it was real dusty around here. The footprints are some of the deeper ones that we had on the lunar surface. The ALSEP site was sort of on a crown - which, generally, makes it less dusty; but, in this place, it was real dusty. You can see John has kicked up some dust on the base of the RTG. It hadn't gotten on the fins or anything, so it didn't bother it as far as its performance.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

John's is the lowest it has been since he got off the Rover at the ALSEP site. Charlie has also just come through a minimum, and in both cases they have both gotten quite a bit of rest, standing still while John did the series of thumper shots. If Charlie had a brief period of 110 beats per minute due to the run back to the Rover, it doesn't show up in the plot, probably because the plotted points represent averages over intervals of a few minutes.]<p>

[John is north of the Central Station, flipping more debris out of the way. Charlie holds something in front of the TV camera; but I, at least, couldn't make it out. It probably would have been better if Charlie had held the object a bit farther away from the camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:25:00</b> England: Yeah, we sure did.<p>

<b>122:25:04</b> Duke: It was a solid piece of glass - spherical - and part of it's broken away, but it really (is the) most unique piece of glass I've ever seen in all the samples. I think.

<b>122:25:42</b> Duke: And it was right out here by the drill. (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[In looking at the video again, I finally picked out the glass sphere. It is about two to three centimeters across.

Charlie collected the glass sphere at <a href="a16.deepcore.html#1215310" target="new">121:53:10</a> just after he dropped the rammer-jammer down the core hole. According to the </i>Apollo 16 Voice Transcript Pertaining to the geology of the landing site<i> by N.G. Bailey and G.E. Ulrich, this is sample 60095, which weighs 46.6 grams.

<b>122:25:51</b> Young: Okay, Charlie. I'm going to deploy this...<p>

<b>122:25:54</b> Duke: Okay, wait a minute. Let me get this thing (meaning the purge valve pin) in, and I'll go back and start on that heat flow. (Correcting himself) I mean the (core)...Can you step away so I don't get these (mortar package) cables?<p>

<b>122:26:05</b> Young: What is it you want to do?<p>

<b>122:26:17</b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[John has backed away from the mortar cable. Charlie bends his right knee and leans to his right to get at John's purge valve.

<b>122:26:48</b> Duke: These Rover tracks are amazing. They're just barely (sinking in)...(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Post-mission analysis of photographs indicates that the maximum depth of the Rover tracks is about 5 cm.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]<p>

[John presses the anchor stakes into the ground. Charlie comes around to the LMP seat and we get a close-up view as he turns his checklist pages. He is looking at prior pages to make sure he has done everything.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It seemed like you just pulled a page up with a finger and then brushed it across.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That's the way we turned it. It was more of a brush. The pages were real stiff and they'd would begin to curl up and then they'd flip over - on the spring. There was a spring they were around - or a wire, a coiled wire. It was sort of like a spring - like a spiral notebook, really.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;But bent back over the shape of your wrist to hold it open.&quot;]<p>

[A detail from Apollo 13 training photo <a href="../cuffcheckbind.jpg" title="image"  target="new">70-HC-83</a> is a good side view of Jim Lovell's cuff checklist.]<p>

[Once Charlie moves out of the way, we see that John has disengaged the UHT and, apparently, is using it to press the southwest corner down. He is trying to get it level. The first few times, it rocks in response to his efforts. Eventually, it doesn't move enough to show in the TV picture. Every once in a while, he puts the UHT back at the center to create a shadow and check the alignment.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:36:43</b> England: Okay, John. (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As shown in Figure <a href="a16psrf10-3.jpg" title="image" target="new">10-3</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, mortar No. 1 will be fired a distance of 1500 m and, at that distance, the 3-degree pointing error will result in an impact about 80 degrees off line to the north. This will necessitate a small adjustment in post-mission data analysis but will not have any significant affect on the value of the results.]<p>

[John sticks his left leg out behind him, leans to his right, and grabs the mortar pack. He then moves to the east side of the mortar base, sticks his left leg out to the side and slightly to the front and then bends his right knee as he carefully places the mortar pack on the base.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:37:02</b> Duke: Okay, Tony. I'm going to get a couple of grab samples out here in front of the Rover about 15 feet. (They) look like typical rocks that are in this area. One of them's...They're mostly dust covered here, but I can pick up a couple that are whitish, and I'll get a couple of cross-Suns before (collecting the samples).<p>

<b>122:37:28</b> England: Sounds good, Charlie. (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Samples are documented with photographs taken before collection and additional photographs taken after collection. These show exactly what rock was collected and what its situation was on the pristine surface. Often, the &quot;before&quot; photos include a &quot;cross-Sun&quot; stereopair taken from either the north or south, and a &quot;down-Sun&quot; taken from the east.]<p>

[Charlie is using John's camera with Apollo 16 magazine 114/B and takes a stereopair, AS16-114-
<a href="images16.html#18383" target="new">18383</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18384" target="new">18384</a>, stepping to his right between frames. As is also indicated in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-13</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, he is sampling in a small crater near the front of the Rover The sample is 60035, a 1.053 kilogram brecciated anorthosite.]<p>

[John has moved around to the north side of the mortar pack. He turns the UHT around so that he is holding the tip, puts the handle on the ground and uses it as a support as he kneels. He has been careful to avoid fouling the tip. He adjusts the leveling and alignment with his left hand.]<p>

[In terrestrial gravity, kneeling was relatively easy because the astronaut's body weight was high enough to overcome the pressurized suit's resistance to bending, as evidenced by a pre-flight <a href="a16.cdkneels.jpg" title="image" target="new">photo</a> showing Charlie kneeling during a suit fitting session. On the Moon, his total weight - including his backpack - wasn't enough to overcome the suit's resistance to kneeling. For some reason, John and Gene Cernan were better able to bend their knees and stay down in a kneeling position.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You could go down on a knee but, to keep your balance, you really needed like a three-point suspension - like a football lineman - so he's using a Universal Tool there to balance himself while he's working with his left hand. And I used the shovel a lot to bend down on - and the other equipment we had, like the rakes and stuff like that, too. Or, you could lean against the Rover or lean against a rock to get your sample if you had to bend over. When you leaned on something in a three-point, you could bend your knees and get down on your knees. But it was difficult to do that just by trying bending down and hold your balance because, if you tried to go down, it seemed like it was going to throw you forward. It took a lot of energy to hold yourself back when the knees were bent. The suit wanted to pitch you forward when you bent your knees.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:37:58</b> Young: (Getting to his feet) Okay. The mortar package is in place. (Pause) Oh, dear. (Pause)<p>

<blockquote><i>[In hopping back to get his balance, John may have kicked some dirt on the base.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:38:14</b> Young: The mortar package...The pallet is level. The mortar package is not quite level; it (meaning the level bubble)'s just off the edge of being level.

<blockquote><i>[John uses the UHT to straighten the cables.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:38:21</b> England: Okay. Understand. The bubble is free of the case, though?<p>

<b>122:38:26</b> Young: Yeah, it is.<p>

<b>122:38:28</b> England: That's fine, then<p>

<b>122:38:29</b> Young: Reasonably enough. (Long Pause) Okay. I'm going to raise the radio antenna (on the mortar package as per 
<a href="a16.lsp061.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-29</a>). Red flag. (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John tries to reach down to get the antenna but doesn't quite make it and, in the end, uses the UHT as a crutch so that he can get on his knees. Note that, now that he is finished with the instrument deployment, he doesn't bother turning the UHT end-for-end and sticks the tip in the ground.]<p>

[Fendell pulls back on the zoom and pans counter-clockwise.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:40:01</b> Young: Okay, the red flag's up. (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Three of the four mortars were successfully fired on May 23, 1972, about a month after John and Charlie left the Moon. The mortar that was to have been fired to a range of 1500 meters was not launched due to the fact that the experimenters were no longer sure that the mortar package was level. After the third mortar was launched, either the pitch sensor failed or the mortar package tipped at an unacceptable angle. Excellent data were obtained from the three successful launches and these data, when combined with the thumper data and data recorded during the LM launch, were used to determine the subsurface structure shown in Figure 10-1 from the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>.]<p>

[Fendell stops his pan just as the magnetometer is about to go out of view and reverses direction. On comm, we can hear Charlie's breathing.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:40:53</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;You're out in front of the Rover now, off-camera collecting a couple of rock samples. Do you have any comments about solo sampling versus team sampling?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, the solo sampling, generally, you just picked up rocks when you were solo. It was hard to get a soil sample, solo, because you'd get a scoopful and it was really difficult to try to pour it in the bag yourself. Generally, you did that when you had a rakeful or a scoopful, one guy'd pour it into the other. And it was easier to document the samples - you know, the down-Sun, cross-Sun, and all the photographs that we had before and after - with two people. So the real documented samples we always did together. But a lot of times we worked separately because you could pick up more rocks that way.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;You know, John and I were like two little kids up there, really. You know how hard it is trying to keep two kids going in the same direction at the zoo or Seaworld or something like that. The same problem you have up on the Moon. I see something over here and there I am and there's John. So a lot of times we worked independently; but we told Houston and a lot of our geology stops had independent sampling.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Would you have used the scoop here to grab these rocks or just go down and get them with your hand?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I think I was just bending over - you know, doing splits - and getting them with my hand.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell pans past John, who is headed for the Rover at a leisurely pace, apparently looking around as he goes. Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit.]</i></blockquote>

<b>122:40:55</b> Young: I can't believe how full of holes this place is. Just general comment. You got the (LMP) camera, Charlie?<p>

<b>122:41:02</b> Duke: No, it's on the Central Station.<p>

<b>122:41:03</b> Young: Oh yeah. (Laughing) I remember the last time we put it on the Central Station (during training), the thing collapsed. I figured you left it over at the car.

And you can see the spaghetti cable that goes back to the Central Station - not only for the data but also for the power. The magnetometer's in the far background, just over the mortar package. You can see the RTG and Central Station in that photograph. There's another piece of little white stuff over here to the upper right but it's, I think, just some debris.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
