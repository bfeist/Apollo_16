<b>119:15:03</b> Young: Okay.  Charlie, I'm gonna off-load the LRV, I guess (as per <a href="a16.lsp041.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-5</a>).<p>

<b>119:15:05</b> Duke: Okay, you be inspecting it.  (Pause)  And all four
(core) stems are out (as per <a href="a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-5</a>).<p>

<b>119:15:21</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie carries the core stems to the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Y</a> (north) footpad and that gives him a chance to take a closer look at the crater behind the spacecraft.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:15:30</b> Duke: Tony, if I get 40 feet back to do the pan from the SEQ Bay here (as indicated at the top of 
<a href="a16.lmpev107.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-7</a>), I'm going to fall in that big hole.  (Pause)  Okay, (Reading 
<a href="a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-5</a>) &quot;ETB to table&quot;.<p>

<b>119:16:03</b> Young: Okay, the aft chassis are (sic) all parallel.  The (garbled) are not pre-released.  (I'm) releasing the thermal blanket.  The walking hinges are locked.  Heh, heh;   how about that?  And the one toward the...

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Inspection of the vehicle (meaning the Rover) showed that none of the things (wheels, chassis sections, etc.) had pre-deployed, to which I may add a hearty 'thank God'.&quot;]<p>

[NASA photo <a href="ap16-KSC-71P-543.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-71P-543 </a> shows Charlie (foreground) and John (beyond the wheels) inspecting the Rover at the Cape on 12 November 1971 while it was being stowed on the Descent stage.  Charlie is standing at the hinge connecting the aft and center chassis sections.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:16:26</b> Duke: Okay; Tony, the paint on this side also, below the steerable antenna, is peeled off just like on the other side.  I don't see anything wrong with that steerable, I guess it just won't work.<p>

<b>119:16:43</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I was really expecting to see a 'remove before flight' pin up there, but there wasn't.  It was perfectly clean, but it just didn't work in yaw at all.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:16:44</b> Young: Had to reset both sets of...<p>

<b>119:16:48</b> England: Charlie...<p>

<b>119:16:48</b> Young: ...walking hinges (as per <a href="a16.lsp043.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-6</a>)...(stops to
listen)<p>

<b>119:16:49</b> England: ...we'll have some pictures for you to take of the steerable later, but we'll get that when you take your pan.<p>

<b>119:16:56</b> Duke: Yeah, I was planning on that.  Okay, John.  Had the walking hinges fixed, huh?<p>

<b>119:17:05</b> Young: Yeah, had to fix both sets.<p>

<b>119:17:06</b> Duke: Okay, I'll help you on this other side.

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The walking hinges were released, just like on 15.  We had to put those back.&quot;]<p>

[The walking hinges are fixtures on the outside of the LM that support the bottom of the Rover package.  As John and Charlie deploy the Rover, they will let the top part of the Rover package rotate out, away from the LM and, during that part of the deployment, the package pivots on the hinges.  On all three of the Rover missions, the Rover packages were found to be off the hinges, probably as a result of getting jarred during landing.  They were easily reset.  Don McMillan has provided an <a href="../WalkingHinge.html" target="new">animation</a> of the hinges on his  <a href="../VirtualLRV.html" target="new">Virtual Rover</a>  in action.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:17:09</b> Duke: Man, what a beautiful landing.  I'm glad you weren't 10 feet (farther back)...Whew me!<p>

<b>119:17:14</b> Young: We were going forward.<p>

<b>119:17:16</b> Duke: Yeah, we were landing going forward.<p>

<b>119:17:20</b> Young: That (crater) was what was worrying me.

<blockquote><i>[All of the Commanders tried to land with a little forward velocity so that they wouldn't drift back onto unseen rocks or craters.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:17:23</b> Duke: Okay;  here's your strap over here, John. <p>

<b><a name="1191725">119:17:25</a></b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[They will use reel-mounted tapes to slowly release the Rover.  John will pull the right-hand tape, which actually lowers the vehicle, while Charlie maintains tension on the left-hand
tape.]<p>

[A film clip <a href="../DukeParker.mov" target="new">(8.6Mb)</a> shows Charlie Duke and Bob Parker participating in a shirtsleeve demonstration of Rover deployment.  Digitization by Gary Neff.]<p>

[Don McMillan has provided an animation ( <a href="../VLRV-unfold.mov" target="new">0.7 Mb</a> ) of his <a href="../VirtualLRV.html" target="new">Virtual Rover</a> unfolding during deployment.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1191736">119:17:36</a></b> Duke: Hey, that big rock under there looks like a vesicular basalt to me.  That black one.  (Pause)  Tony, the engine bell is about 6 inches off the ground and it's not crushed at all.<p>

<b>119:18:00</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Unlike the other flights, there are no Apollo 16 pictures of the area under the LM.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:18:01</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, here we go (up to the porch).<p>

<b>119:18:03</b> Young: Wait a minute.<p>

<b>119:18:04</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  I'm going up the porch, Tony, to get the Rover.  (Pause)  What a pretty machine.

<blockquote><i>[As per <a href="a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-5</a>, Charlie is climbing to the top of the ladder where he will pull a D-ring to release the top of the Rover package and let it rotate out a couple of degrees.  A set of <a href="../alsj-LRVDeployGrumman.html" target="main">Grumman LRV Deployment Cartoons</a> shows various stages of the Rover deployment.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;What can you tell me about the jump up from the footpad to the ladder rungs.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was a lot easier than I had expected.  You had been concerned about not being able to see your feet; but you just seemed to jump and everything landed right!&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was it mostly legs, or arms?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You'd jump mostly with your legs to push.  And you tried to jump and reach up and grab the side of the ladder. And the feet just seemed to fall in.  I was concerned about it at first; but, after I did it the first time, it was a piece of cake.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:18:24</b> Young: I'll just run over here and grab this string, Charlie, and pull on it a little.  Okay, on your string up there, there's tension on it, right?<p>

<b>119:18:43</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>119:18:44</b> Young: Okay, let's just make sure that I've checked all these things.<p>

<b>119:18:46</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>119:18:47</b> Young: (Reading very quickly <a href="a16.lsp041.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-5</a>) &quot;Unstow left side deployment.  Reel OPS tape, drape over struts.  Contingency tool to LM strut.&quot;  (Turning to <a href="a16.lsp043.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-6</a>) &quot;Walking hinge latches engaged.&quot;  (I'll) just verify those one more time.  &quot;(Garbled) aft chassis parallel to center chas(sis). Left and right outrigger cables taut.&quot;  Verify your outrigger cables taut up there...<p>

<b>119:19:03</b> Duke: Yup; two.  Both of them.<p>

<b>119:19:04</b> Young: Okay.  &quot;Want to reel out the tape, right side, and back away from the deploy area.&quot;  Okay, Charlie.<p>

<b>119:19:12</b> Duke: Ready?<p>

<b>119:19:14</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>119:19:15</b> Duke: Okay, here we come.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie pulls the D-ring as per 
<a href="a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-5</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:19:18</b> Young: It released.<p>

<b>119:19:18</b> Duke: We're loose.  It released, Houston.<p>

<b>119:19:20</b> Young: The bottom pins released, too.  Both sets of them.<p>

<b>119:19:32</b> England: Very good.<p>

<b>119:19:34</b> Young: Get Charlie down the steps.<p>

<b>119:19:36</b> Duke: Bouncing merrily.  Man, it's great.<p>

<b>119:19:38</b> Young: Isn't that neat?!<p>

<b>119:19:39</b> Duke: (Expressing his pleasure)  Oh!<p>

<b>119:19:40</b> Young: That has got to be nice.<p>

<b>119:19:45</b> Duke: Believe it or not, this is like in the training
building!  The only thing we don't have, Tony, is the linoleum on the
floors.<p>

<b>119:19:52</b> Young: Grab a surface here, Charlie.<p>

<b>119:19:56</b> England: We'll try to fix that, Charlie.<p>

<b>119:20:58</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony) wait a minute.  I got to...<p>

<b>119:20:00</b> Young: Pulling?<p>

<b>119:20:01</b> Duke: Yeah, I'm pulling.<p>

<b>119:20:02</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  Oh!  This is much easier than it was before (in training)!  Don't pull so hard, I guess.  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:20:18</b> Duke: Can't believe that big hole back there.  John, you picked up the exact bottom of this old crater!!<p>

<b>119:20:25</b> Young: Well, there weren't any flat places around here, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[As indicated in Figure <a href="a16psrf6-13.jpg" title="image" target="new">6-13</a> in the Apollo 16 Preliminary
Science Report, they landed in an old, subdued, 150-meter-diameter crater.  The rim of this crater forms much of the local horizon.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:20:29</b> Duke: Yeah, but anywhere else we would have landed, we would have been on a great big slope!<p>

<b>119:20:34</b> Young: Okay, there goes the front (actually the aft) wheels.  And the aft chassis is released too, I think.<p>

<b>119:20:39</b> England: Very good.

<blockquote><i>[When the Rover package has rotated out about 45 degrees, the aft chassis section, which was folded over the middle chassis section, springs into place and the aft wheels also snap into place.  Don McMillan has provided a Virtual LRV <a href="../WalkingHinge.html" target="new">animation</a> of the deployment, with a focus on the walking hinges.  Training photo <a href="ap16-72-HC-57.jpg" title="image" target="new">72-HC-57</a> shows a deployment at about this stage.  John is pulling on the righthand deployment tape while Charlie is off-camera to the right and has light tension on a cord attached to the rear edge of the aft section.  Note the cooling hoses and comm cables arcing down from the ceiling.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:20:40</b> Duke: The wheels didn't lock into place, John.  We'll have to go up there and get the...and push them up.<p>

<b>119:20:44</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>119:20:45</b> Duke: Okay, you hold that and let me run up and do that.<p>

<b>119:20:48</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:20:52</b> Young: The wheels didn't lock, Houston.<p>

<b>119:20:54</b> England: Okay; we copy that.<p>

<b>119:20:57</b> Young: There goes one.  Charlie got one.  Is it (meaning a latch that holds the wheel in position) in, Charlie?<p>

<b>119:21:05</b> Duke: Yeah, it is.<p>

<b>119:21:08</b> Young: Okay.  And the hinge pin...This hinge pin isn't in either.<p>

<b>119:21:13</b> Duke: We'll get that (after they get the Rover on the ground).

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;On Charlie's side, the left rear wheel was knocked down and locked, so Charlie gave that a pull and pulled that down.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The wheels popped open just like they had done in training.  There's a gold sleeve collar
arrangement that has a couple of pins in it so that, when the wheels are fully out, those pins lock in to hold the wheels in place.  That was what was not locked.  All you have to do is push on the wheel to extend that mechanism and it locks right in place.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:21:14</b> Young: Okay, see if the other one is in.  See if you can't get it.<p>

<b>119:21:21</b> Duke: Okay;  stop pull.  (Pause)  John, I went just out of minimum on my cooling unit, and it feels a lot better.<p>

<b>119:21:30</b> Young: Okay; I'll try that in a second here.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Was it a continuous <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">setting on the cooling</a>, rather than having little detents in it?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, there was some detents but I think you could just edge it out and it would hold.  I remember some distinct detents; you could click into medium and then max; but, also, you could just pull it out a little bit and it would hold - there was enough friction on the switch to hold it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:21:33</b> Duke: Okay;  did it get in the walking hinges?<p>

<b>119:21:36</b> Young: No, I don't think so, Charlie.<p>

<b>119:21:40</b> Duke: Okay, you see what it did.  It didn't look like to me it did.<p>

<b>119:21:44</b> Young: It didn't get in there.  (Pause)  Yeah.  Yeah, it's sitting...(Pause)  Yeah, it's sitting in something there, Charlie.<p>

<b>119:21:57</b> Duke: Okay, they're in.<p>

<b>119:21:00</b> Young: Yeah.  It looks to me that...<p>

<b>119:22:02</b> Duke: Wait a minute.  This one is not in over here. <p>

<b>119:22:05</b> Young: Are you sure?<p>

<b>119:22:06</b> Duke: Yep.<p>

<b>119:22:08</b> Young: You just took it out of this one over here.<p>

<b>119:22:12</b> Duke: (Garbled under comm in Houston)  Okay;  now, this one's in.<p>

<b>119:22:15</b> Young: But just don't run off with it, Charlie. <p>

<b>119:22:16</b> Duke: I'm not.  Okay;  this one's in.<p>

<b>119:22:17</b> Young: Okay, this one's in.<p>

<b>119:22:23</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  Okay, keep going.

<blockquote><i>[On Apollo 15, Dave Scott operated his tape by standing next to the LM and pulling the tape hand over hand.  Jim Irwin operated his by holding it taut and walking backwards away from the LM.  On Apollo 17, Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt also used their legs, rather than their arms.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;If I remember, we did it hand-over-hand, so we could
stay close enough to watch this.  Apparently - it's starting to come back - as it started down, it bounced as we pulled.  As it bounced down, we kept having trouble with these walking hinges which, if I remember, was some things at the bottom that the chassis sort of rotated around in.  I've got a movie of the deployment of the training model in the MSOB (manned Spacecraft Operations Building) down at the Cape.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Looking at the 
<a href="../lrvhand.html" target="new">LRV Handbook</a>, Figure <a href="../lrvf1-38.jpg" title="image" target="new">1-38</a>, there are walking hinges down at the bottom.  And it just pivoted on that.  Let's see, that's the aft part of the chassis that's on the outside, that folds out and the forward part is on the inside, and the hinge between the fore and center chassis sections sits on the walking hinge.  And it's called the 'walking hinge' because the Rover actually moves out, away from the LM on that.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Apparently, but I don't remember.&quot;]<p>

[Don McMillan has provided a Virtual LRV <a href="../WalkingHinge.html" target="new">animation</a> of the walking hinges in action.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;But the main thing is that you did that hand-over-hand. Do you remember anything about whether that was any particular difficulty doing that in a suit.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, that was no problem.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:22:30</b> Young: Don't you want to pull some?<p>

<b>119:22:34</b> Duke: No, it says (Item 2 on <a
href="a16.lmpev105.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-5</a>) &quot;Release pull at aft-chassis
unlock&quot;;  and that's what I did.<p>

<b>119:22:35</b> Young: Okay, it just stepped out of those walking hinges.<p>

<b>119:22:38</b> Duke: I know, and it's bouncing on us.  (Pause)  Those walking hinges are no longer any good anyway, after we get down to this point.

<blockquote><i>[In Houston, the Flight Director is told that the Rover is supposed to come out of the hinges at 73 degrees of
rotation.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:22:46</b> Young: Okay, now it's sitting in them.<p>

<b>119:22:48</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>119:22:49</b> Young: Comes bouncing out.<p>

<b>119:22:50</b> Duke: Yeah; keep pulling.  Watch that big rock there.<p>

<b>119:22:53</b> Young: Oh, I see what you mean!

<blockquote><i>[This exchange suggests that John, at least, is now backing away from the LM.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:22:54</b> Duke: About a 50-centimeter boulder right next to the
<a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Y</a> (south) footpad.  Angular (rock).

<blockquote><i>[This rock is at the lower left in AS16-107-<a href="images16.html#17441" target="new">17441</a>, which is a photo John takes at the start of EVA-2.  One of the LRV deployment tapes is hanging down above it.  The cosmic ray detector is in the footpad and, above and beyond that is the RTG fuel cask in the horizontal position.  The closed SEQ Bay doors are behind the cask.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:23:03</b> Young: Okay, Charlie; do you want me to keep pulling?<p>

<b>119:23:05</b> Duke: Yeah, keep pulling until you hit the gray....  Until we get the weight off of these things (that is, when there is no longer tension on the tapes).  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:23:19</b> Young: You got to pull it away, Charlie. (Pause)<p>

<b>119:23:24</b> Duke: There she comes.<p>

<b>119:23:26</b> Young: Got it.<p>

<b>119:23:27</b> Duke: I can pick that beauty up right off the ground with this little cable.<p>

<b>119:23:31</b> Young: Shall I keep pulling?<p>

<b>119:23:32</b> Duke: Yeah.  Until you get that...Okay, that's it,
John.<p>

<b>119:23:37</b> Young: All the cable is slack. <p>

<b>119:23:38</b> Duke: Yeah, okay;  that's great.<p>

<b>119:23:39</b> Young: Let's go get it.<p>

<b>119:23:40</b> Duke: Okay, here;  you need this.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has probably just given John the contingency tool
with which they will pull some pins and make sure various latches are
secure.  See Figures

<b>119:23:41</b> Young: Wait a minute, that rear wheel isn't locked.<p>

<b>119:23:44</b> Duke: Oh, we'll get that.  Okay, you lock that side.  I'll
pull these pins.  (Pause)  Okay, this one's not locked out, either. 
(Pause)  Okay, now it is.  This hinge (lock) pin is in.<p>

<b>119:24:04</b> Young: And this hinge pin is in.  I think this is locked. 
Ohhh.<p>

<b>119:24:10</b> Duke: Watch out!<p>

<b>119:24:23</b> Duke: Oh, boy, that cooling is so much nicer.  Okay, here we go.<p>

<b>119:24:30</b> Young: Hey, wait a minute, let me get a little further
away from it in case it springs off the...<p>

<b><a name="1192437">119:24:37</a></b> Duke: Hey, you're doing pretty well with that deep-knee-bend stuff.<p>

<b>119:24:41</b> Young: Yeah, I already picked up a rock to see if it was
possible.<p>

<b>119:24:43</b> Duke: Yeah, I saw you.<p>

<b>119:24:46</b> Young: Piece of cake.  Although you got to maintain your c.g. (center of gravity).<p>

<b>119:24:49</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;A couple of months ago, John told me that he had done some work in the airplane seeing if he could get down to one knee. Do you remember that?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And he was good at it.  He would jump up
and then sort of do a split and then he hit and the momentum would carry
him down and he could grab a rock and then, once he got down, the suit
tension would pop him back up.  He was very good at it.  I tried it a
couple of times and I wasn't very good at it, so I stopped.  I'd looked at
it...I could do it in the airplane but, up on the lunar surface, it just
seemed like I was always off balance.  You know, I'd try to grab and I'd
miss it, or I'd grab and it wouldn't come right and it would spin me one
direction or the other and I'd end up falling down.  So I didn't do much of
it; but he did.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;That brings to mind that there is one sequence in the
TV (at about 121:48) where you try it when you're doing the
drilling.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I could do it...Just with the rocks I had the tough
trouble.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:24:54</b> Duke: Tony, are you copying all this?<p>

<b>119:24:57</b> England: We sure are.  We're all ears.  Sure wish we had the TV.<p>

<b>119:25:05</b> Duke: Well, we'll get it for you in a minute.  Sorry about that steerable, but (garbled) breaks.  Okay, the Rover is within 2 feet of being on the ground!  (Doing a credible 
<a href="a16_wcfields.html" target="new">W. C. Fields</a> imitation)  Ah, the old machine!

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Were you a Fields fan when you were a
kid?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:25:22</b> Young: I believe we're a little upslope here.  I get the
feeling (that) if I let go of it, it'll roll under the vehicle (meaning the
LM).<p>

<b>119:25:29</b> Duke: Yeah, I do, too.  (John chuckles)  Okay, there we
go, John.  It's on the ground, Houston.<p>

<blockquote><i>[The checklist pages are bound with a wire coil - rather like a small spiral notebook - and the coil, in turn, is attached to a metal band which goes over the forearm just above the wrist.

accidents.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, I know.  It was easy to get tangled up in stuff,
because you couldn't feel anything and you couldn't see anything on the
bottom part of the suit.  You just couldn't look down too much and see your feet, so it was really miraculous we didn't get tangled up more than we did.  But, looking at one another and keeping track of one another really helped a lot.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;What, in your mind, is the best solution.  Stronger
connectors?  Cable materials that stay flat?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Those cables that we had, we told 'em in training that
we were going to have problems with those, because they were like
spaghetti.  The ones in training laid flat because they were used so much. 
You know, they didn't have their set in them.  But the actual ones, you
started pulling them out and they kept the set.  And we had told them we
thought we were going to have a problem, 'cause there were just a lot of
cables coming around that Central Station.  I think strong connectors,
tear-proof cables (are necessary).  (That is) certainly something you need
to look at in the future, 'cause that's just tragic, you know, to tangle
yourself up in a cable and pull it loose just because of some little
accident.  So we need to design things that lay flat, if we can, and that
would be stronger.  I think all of that would help.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;One thing I'd like to comment on here is that I think they overdesigned the Velcro
holding the seats down on the LRV.  A 2-inch or 1 1/2-inch wide piece of
Velcro is wrapped around on themselves to hold the seat in place.  On my
side, I started pulling the Velcro to try to get it off of the outboard
handhold and the seat, and all I succeeded in doing is picking the vehicle
up off the ground.  The Velcro wouldn't come loose.  Then I tried a couple
of snatch loads and, by snatching it, I eventually got the Velcro off.  It
was a hard job getting that Velcro off.  They really over-killed that
one.&quot;]<p>

[Slayton, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I gather you thought
all the Velcro as difficult to work, or (was) excessive.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Yes, I did.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;For what we were using
it for, it was.  Although, we had a couple of cases of these in-house
devices (equipment made by NASA) that we will talk about later, where the
Velcro was burned off, the glue that attaches the Velcro melted or
something.  Like on the padded bags, and on the TV sunshade.  And there was something else (namely the Sample Collection Bag attachments).&quot;]<p>

[See a discussion of the sunhade/sunshield at <a href="a16.sta10prime.html#1692059" target="new">169:20:59</a>.]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was just like you'd
expect, Deke.  When you wanted the Velcro to work, it wouldn't work; and
when you didn't want it to work, you couldn't get the son-of-a-gun off of
there.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

John and Charlie are now removing the tripods.  Don McMillan's <a href="../WalkingHinge15.mov" target="new">animation</a> of the 'walking hinge' in operation has the tripod closest to the ladder labelled. Two of the three Quick Release pins on that tripod are shown.  <a href="../LRV_Ops_Handbook_f2-6_sheet2.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 2-6 (sheet 2)</a> in the LRV Operations Handbook (<a href="../LRV_OpsNAS8-25145.pdf" target="new">40 Mb</a>) and pages <a href="../LRV_Ops_Handbook_p2-13.jpg" title="image" target="new">2-13</a> and <a href="../LRV_Ops_Handbook_p2-14.jpg" title="image" target="new">2-14</a> detail the procedures.

[McMillan adds, &quot;The tripods were attached to the rover chassis which were then connected to the Space Support Equipment on the LM. The tripod apexes were connected to support spools located on the left and right support arms, shown in <a href="../LRV_Ops_Handbook_f1-37.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 1-37</a> in the LRV Ops Handbook. Once the rover was deployed on the surface the pins were pulled and the tripods were disconnected. This next part is really clever. The center section of each tripod was then used as a toe hold on the appropriate side of the rover (<a href="LRV_Ops_Handbook_f1-29.jpg" title="image" target="new">Fig. 1-29</a> and <a href="LRV_Ops_Handbook_Sect_1.7.8.jpg" title="image" target="new">Section 1.7.8</a>).&quot;</i></blockquote>

So that's what I'm talking about.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you ever take the camera off the bracket to use
it?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, a lot of times...Well, I don't know about that. 
No, mostly, when I used it, it was on the bracket.  I don't remember
removing it to point it up.  It was easier to leave it on the
bracket.&quot;]<p>

<b>119:36:44</b> Duke: You've got all your steering.  It's great!<p>

ride!  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:37:02</b> Duke: The Rover is running, Houston.

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;We were always amazed when things worked!  (Laughing)  Because, in training, half the time it never worked.  So it was always 'Eureka!!! It's working!'  You know, millions of dollars they spent on this stuff and it was always a big surprise when it all worked for
us.&quot;]<p>

[As per <a href="a16.lsp043.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-8</a>, John will make a counter-clockwise circle around the LM
and park at the MESA.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:37:05</b> England: Okay, and when you're over at the S-band, we have a couple of more pictures of that one.<p>

<b>119:37:11</b> Duke: I just got it, Tony.<p>

<b>119:37:14</b> England: Okay, there's a particular surface on it we're
interested in.<p>

<b>119:37:21</b> Duke: Stand by.  Okay, just a minute.<p>

<b>119:37:26</b> Young: Let me try it through a few of these little craters here, Charlie.  You know, it's hard to get to where you are from here.  (Chuckles)<p>

<b>119:37:39</b> Duke: Okay, the ablated paint surfaces:  there were only two, and it's the two above the ascent tank.  (Pause)  John, you were
coming absolutely straight down when you hit.  Okay, Tony, go ahead with
the S-band.<p>

<b>119:37:54</b> England: Okay, we want you to take a picture of the white side of the yoke.  The yoke has a black side and a white side.  (Pause)  And on the white side, we want at 1/250th, f/5.6, f/8, and f/11.<p>

<b>119:38:13</b> Duke: Okay, I've got the f/8 and f/11.  I'll do the 5.6
one.<p>

<b>119:38:17</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>119:38:21</b> Duke: John, you're sure going slow.<p>

<b>119:38:23</b> Young: Yeah, the wheels are skidding, Charlie.<p>

<b>119:38:25</b> Duke: Okay, your rear steering's off. <p>

<b>119:38:27</b> Young: Huh?<p>

<b>119:38:28</b> Duke: You don't have any rear steering.<p>

<b>119:38:30</b> Young: Is that what the problem is?<p>

<b><a name="1193831">119:38:31</a></b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[The Apollo 15 crew had no front steering during the first
EVA.  At the start of EVA-2, however, it was working normally.  On the
Apollo 16 Rover, the rear steering starts working when John leaves the LM
for the ALSEP deployment site at <a href="a16.alsepoff.html#1204521"
target="new">120:45:21</a>.]<p>

[In the Apollo 16 Mission Report, after discussions of possible causes
of the rear-steering anomaly, the following discussion focuses on a
possible warm-up phenomenon. &quot;Another possible cause of the anomalous
condition is in the steering servo system (Figure 14-70).  A signal
generated by the handcontroller is coupled to the input servo amplifier as
an error signal across a bridge.  This signal is amplified and applied to
the steering-motor field coils in a direction determined by the polarity of
the input signal which depends upon the direction of the handcontroller
deflection.  The feedback potentiometer is driven by the steering motor in
a direction to balance the bridge, thus canceling the original error signal.  A non-conductive lubricant, DC40, is applied to the wiper and resistive element of the potentiometers (in the handcontroller) to produce smooth operation and reduce noise.  At low temperatures, the lubricant could become more viscous and insulate the wiper from the resistive element.  No error signal would then be present at the input to the servo amplifier, although the handcontroller was deflected.  As the steering electronics heat up, the lubricant becomes less viscous.  Exercising the handcontroller then cleans the lubricant from the wiper and resistive element, allowing contact to be made.  This would account for the anomalous condition.  Tests will be conducted to determine the effect of the lubricant on the potentiometers at low temperatures.&quot;]<p>

[Readers should note that this explanation begs the question of why
the rear steering was affected but not the front and why, in the Apollo 15
case, front steering became operable at the start of the second EVA.  On
both flights, sun angle may have played a role in warming the lubricant. 
Changes may have been made to the steering system after Apollo 16 because no similar problems were experienced on Apollo 17.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:38:32</b> Young: I thought you said both steerings was (sic)
working?<p>

<b>119:38:33</b> Duke: It looked it to me, but it's not now.<p>

<b>119:38:36</b> Young: You know why it's not working?<p>

<b>119:38:37</b> Duke: We don't have a battery.<p>

<b>119:38:39</b> Young: Huh?<p>

<b>119:38:42</b> Duke: Huh?  (Pause)  Shift it to the other battery. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>119:38:50</b> Young: How's it doing now?<p>

<b>119:38:53</b> Duke: Nope.  Front's working, but the rear's not.<p>

<b>119:38:58</b> Young: Well, I just checked Bus B and Bus D.  We
don't...Okay, let me go to primary.  (Pause)  That make any difference?<p>

<b>119:39:08</b> Duke: Nope.  Rear steering's not working.<p>

<b>119:39:10</b> Young: Okay.  I'm gonna park it anyway.  We can't
trouble-shoot it now.<p>

<b>119:39:14</b> Duke: Okay, could you...That's good; that's a good
position.  Okay, Tony.  The rear steering is not working.<p>

<b>119:39:20</b> England: Okay, we copy that.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I wasn't
particularly concerned about the rear steering not working, because we sort of planned not to use rear steering.  In fact, if the rear and front
steering had gone out, we planned to go in a straight line as far as we
could, get out, pick the thing up, and point it in the right direction and
keep right on going.  On that particular site, that would have been hairy. 
We'd have been doing a lot of getting out and picking up.  But I still
think, if we had to do it for any reasonable amount of time, it would have
been a lot better than walking.&quot;]<p>

[As can be seen in AS16-113-
<a href="images16.html#18339" target="new">18339</a>, John parked the Rover north of the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Y</a> (north) strut with the vehicle pointed more or less toward the west.  Charlie will take this excellent photo at about 
<a href="a16.alsepoff.html#1202535" target="new">120:25:35</a>.  Note that John has jumped perhaps a half meter off the ground.  The UV camera is in the LM shadow behind him and Stone Mountain is in the background.  The MESA is on the northwest face of the Descent Stage beyond the front of the Rover. What appears to be the gnomon is on the ground under the ladder and the LEC is draped on the ladder strut support.  The steerable antenna is the dark disk at the upper left of the
Ascent Stage.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:39:33</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, the pan is complete.  The LM just looks super.  It's in perfect shape.  No problem.  The soil around here is very fine grained.  Dusty, much like all the regolith that we've seen samples of from the other sites.  The rocks are scattered.  Perhaps 20 or 30 percent of the surface is covered by boulders up to 25 centimeters.  Small craters pock mark the whole place;  meter to 2-meter size, covering perhaps 70 percent of the surface.<p>

<b><a name="1194012">119:40:12</a></b> Young: Charlie, I ought to be able to get a Nav align from right here.  Okay, I got the LRV parked by the MESA.  And, except for the rear steering, it works pretty good.  I don't understand that.<p>

<b>119:40:28</b> Young: Don't ask me to check if the rear coupling's been pulled.  Don't ask me to do that.  Oh.  (Pause, probably as he dismounted)  That pin is still taped down for the rear steering (as it should be, apparently).  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;(With regard to John's 'don't ask me to
check') It was some mechanism back in there; you know, it was like a
rack-and-pinion deal.  But I don't remember exactly what it was.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;But it would have meant getting down to look under the
Rover.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, yeah; and I forget exactly how you do it, but it
was tough to get to.  We looked at in training to see if we could fix
something, but it was just a pain.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
