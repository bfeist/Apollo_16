<b>139:22:20</b> Duke: Hello, Houston; 15 (sic).  (Long Pause)  Hello, Houston; 15.  Over.<p>

<b><a name="1392252">139:22:52</a></b> England: Good morning, Charlie.  How are you?<p>

<b>139:22:59</b> Duke: I guess it's 16;  excuse me.  (Hearing Tony) Fine. 
I guess we're 16.  How did the biomed look on me all night long, Tony?<p>

<b>139:23:07</b> England: Okay, Charlie.  I guess the biomed looked good.  How do you feel this morning?<p>

<b>139:23:15</b> Duke: I feel great.  Why don't you have the docs tell me how much they think I slept?  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1392327">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1392327.mp3" target="new">1 min 53 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>139:23:27</b> England: Charlie, they say they think you've slept 6 hours.<p>

<b>139:23:36</b> Duke: Okay, fine.  I was going to say 7.  Of course, I don't know exactly when we got started, but once we got started, it was just like a baby, except for...One time,  I woke when I got cold, and had to put on my sleeping bag.<p>

<b>139:23:53</b> England: Outstanding.

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;We had a little knitted thing that looked like cheesecloth, really, but it had wider pattern on it.  We had 'em on the Command Module and the Lunar Module.  You just climb into it and zip it up.  It didn't look like it'd help you much, but it did.  I was surprised, because it had a pretty wide weave to it.  You could hold it up and see through it real easy.  It might be called a Sleep Restraint.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:23:59</b> Duke: Okay; here we go with the crew status report.  First, I'd like to say that we gorged ourselves, really, and still couldn't eat everything.  I tell you, one of those meals would fill the whole Roman army on maneuvers for 2 days.  But John, he ate, yesterday: Day 5 Meal C, and Day 6 Meal A.  And on Day 5 Meal C, John ate everything, plus an EVA beverage.  And the Day 6 meal A, which was breakfast yesterday, John ate everything except the ham steak.  You can scratch the ham steak.  He got 7 hours and 15 minutes sleep last night, and he took no medication.  Over.<p>

<b>139:25:12</b> England: Okay; we got that, Charlie.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>139:25:33</b> Duke: Okay; turning to my page.  On Day 5 Meal C, you can scratch the chocolate pudding, and I ate everything else plus the EVA beverage.  And John, also, had an EVA beverage.  On Day 6 Meal A, I ate everything but the ham steak.  Over.<p>

<b><a name="1392603">139:26:03</a></b> England: Okay; we copy.

<blockquote><i>[Details for the meals can be found in  the <a href="a16LM11Menu.jpg" title="image" target="new">LM Menu</a> given in the Apollo 16 Press Kit ( <a href="A16_PressKit.pdf" target="new">5.6 Mb</a>  PDF ).]<p>

[I presume &quot;an EVA beverage&quot; means a <a href="../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new">drink bag</a> full of potassium-fortified orange drink.]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;We had too much food.  Dave (Scott) said they ate everything; but we couldn't have possibly eaten everything.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;We did our best; we did pretty good on them.  I thought we were only getting two meals a day, and I thought we did eat pretty much of everything, as the log will show.  I think we left out the (cold) frankfurters or something else like that.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:26:10</b> Duke: And I said I got 7 hours, but whatever you all say.  I slept real good;  feel great.  (Pause)<p>

<b>139:26:28</b> England: Okay; before you all get too covered up (with the suit), we'd like you to check your biomed sensors.  (Pause)  And did you take any medication?<p>

<b>139:26:37</b> Duke: Yeah, I took another Seconal again, to start off.  And I guess my biomed (sensor) is good;  John's look firm as they can be.<p>

<b>139:26:57</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>139:27:05</b> Duke: Now we're going to start the chow.  And, well, I guess I'll copy the lift-off times first, if you have them.<p>

<b>139:27:13</b> England: Say again, Charlie.<p>

<b>139:27:19</b> Duke: Do you have those lift-off times for us?<p>

<b>139:27:24</b> England: Okay; stand by one.  (Long Pause)  Okay, Apollo 16.  We don't have that block time yet.  We'll get it to you in a minute.  We have a couple of questions about the (ALSEP) heat flow (experiment) again, if you want to think about those.<p>

<b>139:28:16</b> Duke: Go ahead.<p>

<b>139:28:17</b> England: Okay.  That heat flow cable that fits into the Central Station is connected to a printed circuit board inside the connector there.  And we're curious about the end of the cable.  Does it have any of that printed circuit board on it or is it just a free end of the ribbon cable?<p>

<b>139:28:41</b> Duke: Tony, I was thinking about that last night, and it looked like to me that it might have some of that printed circuit.  All I can see is that the end of the cable is very smooth and it's silver and I think the printed circuit is partly silver, but I'm not really positive; that's something you can think about.  And it is very smooth; and around the connector it is very smooth there, also.  And as John kicked that thing out of there, it came right out of there without moving the Central Station at all!  Over.<p>

<b>139:29:26</b> England: Okay.  How about the PSE - the passive seismic cable?  Is it tight?  What we have to decide here is, if you move the Central Station, will it disturb the PSE?  That thing (meaning the sensors in the seismometer) is uncaged now and you can't re-cage it.  So we can't afford to move it.  (Pause)<p>

<b>139:29:58</b> Duke: Well, he said he thinks it's pretty tight, John does; but I can't remember.  How far do you want to move it?<p>

<b>139:30:10</b> England: Well, what we're thinking about is if we did ask you to take off that astroconnector on the heat flow experiment, you may have to lift the station up to get underneath to the little lever.<p>

<b>139:30:24</b> Duke: Yeah.  But, Tony, everybody's told me it's serrated and once you got that little beauty on there, you can't get it off!<p>

<b>139:30:34</b> England: We're working on that now.<p>

<b>139:30:40</b> Duke: Yeah, I think there's a little pin or something in there you have to push in.  And I don't know whether we got the tools for that.  (Pause)  Well, I think we could do that.  It's not that tight.  I think we could do that;  pick it up.<p>

<b>139:30:59</b> England: Okay; understand.  Fredo's (Fred Haise) been over running, suited, this heat flow experiment, to see if the procedure is effective.  We don't have a decision yet.  We don't want to get you all excited about it, but we'll have something - a yes or no - in about 45 minutes.<p>

<b>139:31:19</b> Duke: Well, I guess we'll still be here.<p>

<b>139:31:25</b> England: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<b>139:32:12</b> Duke: Tony, if I thought yesterday's meal was big, you ought to see this one.  Man, there's a lot of chow here.  (Pause)<p>

<b>139:32:38</b> England: Charlie, which meal did you say you're eating?  (Pause)<p>

<b>139:32:52</b> Duke: It's breakfast.  Day 7 meal A...<p>

<b>139:32:55</b> England: Okay.  (Pause) We're just trying to put a little weight on you.<p>

<b>139:32:56</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony) Day 6, Meal B tonight.  Man, I tell you, I feel &quot;oink&quot; right now.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Details for the meals can be found in  the <a href="a16LM11Menu.jpg" title="image" target="new">LM Menu</a> given in the Apollo 16 Press Kit ( <a href="A16_PressKit.pdf" target="new">5.6 Mb</a>  PDF ).]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:33:25</b> England: I can just sit here and talk a few words about the traverse today, if you like.  I haven't really organized my notes on it, so it may ramble a little bit, but I've gotten a briefing by the planning team.  It looks like an interesting plan here.  The traverse is almost...Well, it's exactly like normal EVA-2.<p>

<b>139:33:50</b> Young: (The Approving Teacher)  There you go.

<blockquote><i>[The stations planned for the EVA-2 traverse are shown on the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp269-s.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-II, 2 of 2</a>&quot; map.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:33:52</b> England: (Chuckles)  From Ken (Mattingly)'s words, he can see definite benches in Stone Mountain and thinks that you'll have a pretty good chance of identifying them.  He can see layers in South Ray, which makes the rays at Station 8 a whole lot more interesting than we had even anticipated.  So right now, we'd like you to do a normal (Stations) 4, 5, and 6.  The main thing identifying 6 is being on the bottom of the slope of the lowest bench, Station 5 being on top of the first bench, and Station 4 being on top of the second bench.  In fact, it may be even a little above.  Right now, we're thinking that we won't have you aim for Crown, because Crown is probably a little bit more subdued than we'd like, and probably not worth the effort to get to.  Cinco D and E is, as we talked about before...(will) probably be Station 4 (as planned).  It'll probably be a
good place.  At the end of Station 5, we may have you do an LPM (Lunar
Portable Magnetometer).  I'll update this all in real time for you, I'm
just talking about what we'll probably do here.  And Station 7 we're going
to eliminate and take the whole time and put it at Station 10 so you'll be
able to do that LM-area sampling you asked for; we think that sounds great.  As you drive (west) from 6 to 8, we're more interested now that you do get some pictures of Stubby as you go along - of that area - because we don't have Station 7; so we'll ask you to turn your DAC (Data Acquisition Camera, the 16-mm movie camera) over that way as you're driving.  A DAC pointed down-Sun probably wouldn't see much, anyway, in that zero phase.

<blockquote><i>[Stubby Crater, which is at the foot of Stone Mountain, is
south of the Station 6 to Station 8 traverse.  What Tony is saying here is
that they may as well use the 16-mm camera to try to get pictures of Stubby because the forward, westerly view during this part of the traverse will be badly washed out.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:35:32</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, I think you'll be able to...From up on
Stone there, it looks like to me you're gonna be able to see right into
South Ray and right into Stubby and all those craters.  The general
topography here is a downslope.  From North Ray, it leads from the ridge to our immediate right all the way down to South Ray, with the lowest point really being maybe south of Survey Ridge.  Over.

<blockquote><i>[Survey Ridge is shown on the <a href="a16.lsp268.jpg" title="map" target="new">&quot;Descartes EVA-II, 1 of 2&quot; map</a> and runs northeast/southwest through BT/82.  As indicated on the map, John and Charlie plan to travel along the ridge crest during the outbound traverse.  The appearance of Survey Ridge on the map is a bit deceiving in that the photographs used to construct the map was taken with the Sun low in the east and, consequently, a ridge should be darker on its west flank and brighter on its east flank - a shadow pattern opposite the one in the craters.  In fact, the west side of Survey Ridge is brighter than the east side and I suspect this is due to the presence of South Ray ejecta.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:36:06</b> England: Okay, right.  And we could see, or I think I could see, the bright area of South Ray on the TV pan.  It really stands out down there.  But our really exciting station looks like it may be Station 8, and we're really going to encourage you to scout around and see if you can get the samples of the different layers that we see in South Ray.<p>

<b>139:36:31</b> Duke: It looks to us like the base of Stone Mountain is really topographically lower than we are right now.<p>

<b>139:36:42</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)  And, also, on Station 9, it may turn out to be difficult to find a pristine area.  We'll let you scout around a little bit, and pick your own Station 9 on whatever looks like isn't ray material.  And on the location of Station 10, we'd like you to put it just about where you said it might go as you were driving back yesterday.  It sounds like the contact between the ray and the non-ray material is just west of you there, and we'd like to run the penetrometer array along the contact but in the ray material;  that is, the penetrometer array would now go in a northeast/southwest direction.  And a double core would be something like 50 meters to the southwest of the deep core.  (Pause) I may correct that (in) a second here.  Hold on.  (Pause)  I'll correct that.  The double core will be about 50 meters towards the LM but along the contact, so it'll be about 50 meters closer to the LM than the deep drill.  (Pause)  And at Station 10, since you'll have a longer sampling time, we'd like you to sample on both sides of the ray; in other words, in the ray, along the line between the deep drill core and the LM, and off the ray to the west.  (Pause)<p>

<b>139:38:41</b> Young: (Changing subjects)  Okay, Houston.  We're going to have to move the UV camera back.  I think the front lens is starting to get into the Sun.<p>

<b>139:38:52</b> England: Say again, John.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[It is not easy to understand John's transmission because of the static and the fact that he has changed subjects.  Somebody else in Houston apparently understood what John said and told Tony.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:38:58</b> England: Okay, we've got a plan here at the end of the EVA to move it back.  Do you think it will stay out of the Sun until then?<p>

<b>139:39:05</b> Young: Did you get that, Houston?  (Pause)  Houston, 16.  Over.<p>

<b>139:39:17</b> England: Go ahead.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As we will discover in a moment, the LM crew is no longer able to hear Tony because of a problem with the communications link between Houston and the receiving station in Australia.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:39:38</b> Duke: Houston, did you copy John?  Over.<p>

<b>139:39:41</b> England: We sure did there, Charlie.  You copy us?  (Long Pause)<p>

[During a lunch break, Charlie told me that, when he and John got home after the mission, they found that generous supplies of Swan had been delivered to their homes.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:46:29</b> Houston: Honeysuckle Comm Tech, Houston Comm Tech.  Contact Net 1 for a comm check.<p>

<b>139:46:31</b> Saxon: Loud and clear.  Comm check on me.<p>

<b>139:46:33</b> Houston: You're loud and clear, also.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[In an 2000 exchange of e-mail, Saxon reported &quot;I sat on the M &amp; O (main) console at Honeysuckle Creek Apollo station through all the Apollo and Skylab missions, and then moved into Deep Space support at Honeysuckle and then Tidbinbilla station, also here in the ACT (Australian Capital Territory).  Then a couple of years consulting with JPL - finally retiring in 1997. A wonderful 31 years for NASA - really privileged to have taken part in 'the golden years'. One of my jobs was to talk to the Astronauts if communications were lost.  I was about 1 sec away from talking to the Apollo-8 crew when they came out from behind the moon for the first time....but that's another story. :-)&quot;]<p>

[&quot; (Prior to Apollo 16) I was beginning to think I'd never
talk to the Astronauts on Apollo.  Of course, I could have left the
system in a big way by congratulating Armstrong after 'One small step' - but we were a fairly disciplined if somewhat 'laid back' mob in those days!  One day I'll have to tell you the story of how I finally got to shout John Young a Swan Lager here in Canberra about 23 years later!&quot;]<p>

[Saxon has provided two photos from celebrations in Australia of the 25 anniversary of Apollo 11.  In the <a href="a16swan1.jpg" title="image" target="new">first photo</a>, John Young (right) watches a glass of Swan being poured and, in the <a href="a16swan2.jpg" title="image" target="new">second</a>, salutes John Saxon (left).]<p>

[For our non-Australian/British readers, &quot;shout&quot; means buying a round of drinks, paying for dinner, etc. for others.  It derives from the practice of the person buying the next round calling loud enough to get the barman's attention.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:46:52</b> England: Orion, Houston.<p>

<b>139:46:59</b> Duke: Go ahead.<p>

<b>139:47:02</b> England: Hey, outstanding!  You're back.<p>

<b>139:47:05</b> Duke: Yeah, you were gone for a little while, and we had a nice chat with Honeysuckle.  They're mighty friendly folks down there.<p>

<b>139:47:17</b> England: Very good.  Hey, during some of that, I was chatting away about EVA-2.  I wonder how much of it you got?  Did you get on through to Station 10?<p>

<b>139:47:30</b> Duke: No, we stopped at about Station 8, Tony.  Well, actually, you were talking about taking pictures of Stubby as we go by Station 7;  and that was all.<p>

<b>139:47:42</b> England: Okay, fine.  If you'd like, I'll continue on with that.<p>

<b>139:47:49</b> Young: Okay, Tony.  You know, in real time, how we're going to have to do this: you guys are going to have to tell us, when we
get to a place, what you want done when we get there.  There's no way we
can remember it or write it down.<p>

<b>139:48:02</b> England: Oh, I understand that.  And we'll do all of it real time, but I just thought that you might like an overall plan before you get out.<p>

<b>139:48:14</b> Young: Okay; that's a good idea.<p>

<b>139:48:15</b> England: Okay.  As you drive from Station 6 to 8, we'd
like for you to swing that DAC (Data Acquisition Camera) over and take
pictures into Stubby, and all points to the south.  And then we're going to
really stress Station 8, because it may be a chance to sample many of those materials that Ken was able to see in South Ray, so Station 8 is a key station.  Station 9, we're not at all sure that you'll be able to
rec(gonize)...The nominal Station 9 is a pristine area, so we'll just let
you scout around and see if you can find the best you can.  And Station 10 will be longer.<p>

<b>139:49:03</b> Duke: I was going to say, Tony.  I guarantee you we'll
find a place that's out of sight of the LM that's 3 or 4 kilometers away.

<blockquote><i>[At Station 9 they will collect a special soil sample by
pressing a cloth pad on a patch of pristine soil that is not only out of
sight of the LM but is also sheltered by an intervening rock. As can be
seen on the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp269-s.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-II, 2 of 2</a>&quot; map, Station 8 is planned for a location in a bright portion of a ray from South Ray and is expected to yield samples of materials dug out by that impact.  Station 9 is planned for a darker-appearing site which, presumably, will be less coverage by South Ray material.  Tony's &quot;we're not at all sure you'll be able to rec(gonize)&quot; may refer to an anticipated difficulty they could have in recognizing when they are on or off a ray.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:49:11</b> England: Okay, good show.  And Station 10 will be 12 to 15 minutes longer (than planned) now, and we'd still like it on a line between the deep core and the LM, so it will be on a northeast line.  And we'd like it in the ray that you described, but near enough to the edge so that you can sample off the west edge of the ray.  Also, we'd like you to pick up that vesicular basalt that you described underneath the engine bell.<p>

<b>139:49:48</b> Young: Okay.  Hey, listen.  This is a pretty good size...I
don't know how big this ray is, but for us to sample on the west edge of it
(laughs), I don't understand how we're going to do that.<p>

<b>139:50:04</b> England: Where do you think that west edge was?  Was it all the way back towards Spook?<p>

<b>139:50:15</b> Young: It's not that far;  but I think, like, if we go due
west of the LM, we can go 300 meters and start running into some really big boulders, which are probably in the center of the ray, and then they thin out a little off to the other side...So, the ray...I think we're in about
the three quarters of it, and it probably runs over that way for a good
long ways.

<blockquote><i>[John seems to be saying that they are about halfway from the center of the ray toward its eastern edge.  He is noted for the
difficulty he sometimes has in expressing himself clearly.  See, however,
his second try at 51:03]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:50:53</b> England: John, the comm was bad enough, I didn't get all that.  Maybe they got it in the Backroom back there, and we'll act on it
(in) real time.<p>

<b>139:51:03</b> Young: Okay.  All I'm saying is the ray must be 350 meters wide, and we're on probably the (pause) east half of it.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>139:51:40</b> England: When you get a chance up there, could you look out the window and see if the LRV battery covers are still open?  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The Rover is parked near the MESA and is visible out
Charlie's window.  Unfortunately, John and Charlie did not take any
pictures out the windows after the start of EVA-1.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:52:02</b> Duke: Yeah, they're both still open, Tony.<p>

<b>139:52:04</b> England: Okay, they're both still open.<p>

<b>139:52:09</b> Duke: Yeah; in fact, all three of them are open.  (Pause)  Oh, that's right.  John just reminded me (that) two of them are hooked together, but they're all open anyway.<p>

<b>139:52:26</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>139:52:29</b> Young: I think one problem, (garbled) analysis may not
have figured, is that we probably are parked at about a four or five degree right roll.  So it put it more into the Sun than it would have been
otherwise.<p>

<b>139:52:47</b> England: Right.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]<p>

[John is saying that the pre-flight recommendations on parking orientations were based on the assumption that the Rover would be parked on a level spot.  Any vehicle roll or pitch will change the orientation of the shadows cast by the battery covers and, consequently, will change the degree of cooling the batteries will experience during the rest
period.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:54:30</b> England: I have this block data here, if you want to take it sometime.  (Pause)<p>

<b>139:54:41</b> Young: Okay.  (Garbled) my opinion, would probably be to sample the edge of ray, we gotta go east maybe about 100 meters.<p>

<b>139:54:52</b> England: I'm sorry, John.  The comm is real bad.  Say it
again, please.<p>

<b>139:54:59</b> Young: I said, it would probably be best to go east a
hundred meters to sample the edge of the ray.  We'd be closer to the edge.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>139:55:22</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  Give me 2 seconds, and you start going with the update.  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1395539">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1395539.mp3" target="new">7 min 05 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>139:55:39</b> England: Okay, the block data update.  (Pause)  T-35, 142 plus 10 plus 51;  T-36, 144 plus 09 plus 22;  T-37, 146 plus 07 plus 53;  T-38, 148 plus 06 plus 25;  T-39, 150 plus 04 plus 57.  And that's it. 
(Long Pause)<p>

<b>139:56:56</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  For some reason Rev 34 is blank.  We missed that last night, and we didn't get it this morning.  But starting
with 35:  142 plus 10 plus 51;  144 plus 09 plus 22;  146 plus 07 plus 53; 
1 plus 48 plus 06 plus 25;  150 plus 04 plus 57.  Over.<p>

<b>139:57:28</b> England: Okay; the only one I have question on was
T-38:148 plus 06 plus 25.<p>

<b>139:57:37</b> Duke: That's a Charlie; that's what I got.<p>

<b>139:57:40</b> England: Okay; good show.

<blockquote><i>[After EVA-1, at <a href="a16.debrief1.html#1281415"
target="new">128:14:15</a>, Tony read up the block data for Command Module orbits 28 to 33.  T-34 is the launch opportunity on the next Command Module pass over the landing site, which is at approximately 142 hours 11 minutes.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:57:46</b> Duke: Hey, is it Friday or Saturday down there?<p>

<b>139:57:51</b> England: You know, I had to think about that last night. 
In fact, I had to ask Kathy.  It's Saturday.<p>

<b>139:57:56</b> Duke: Okay; thank you.  Saturday morning?<p>

<b>139:58:01</b> England: Rog.  It was a nice, humid, but sunny morning
when I came in.<p>

<b>139:58:09</b> Duke: Good show.  What is your GET (Ground Elapsed Time) now?<p>

<b>139:58:13</b> England: Say again, Charlie?<p>

<b>139:58:19</b> Duke: (Speaking very slowly) What is the present GET? 
Over.<p>

<b>139:58:24</b> England: Okay, it's about 10 minutes 'til eight in the
morning.<p>

<b>139:58:34</b> Young: (Lecturing) GET; Ground Elapsed Time.<p>

<b>139:58:36</b> England: Oh, EGT (sic).  GET is 140 plus 10.  (Pause) 
You'll have to excuse me down here.  I'm having to interpolate.  The comm
is really bad.<p>

<b>139:59:01</b> Duke: (Stretching the truth) Well, Honeysuckle was reading us pretty good!  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The difference between the Ground Elapsed Time Tony just stated and the current Journal time is due to an 11 minute 48 second
addition Houston made at <a href="a16.eva1prep.html#1180631"
target="new">118:06:31</a>, which was during the EVA-1 Prep.  The change has been made to clocks in Mission Control and the CSM but not yet on-board the LM.  The LM clock won't be changed until just before lift-off.  The update was dictated by CSM orbital changes resulting from the three-orbit delay in landing and, consequently, a late circularization burn.  CSM events like LOS, AOS and acquisition of photo targets weren't coming up according to Mattingly's flight plan, hence the change.]</i></blockquote>

<b>139:59:42</b> England: Orion, Houston.  Are you going to carry your
pliers out with you?<p>

<b>139:59:52</b> Duke: Yeah;  John's got 'em in...(He) had them in his
pocket last time.<p>

<b>139:59:56</b> England: Okay, good show.  We may need that to work on the cosmic ray.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[In preparation for my visit to San Antonio, Charlie
retrieved from storage various pieces of flight equipment he had kept.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;The pliers look like fairly ordinary needle-nose
pliers.  It says 'Crescent 25, 4 1/2', and has a white plastic material on
the handles.  They are fairly stiff if you try to  get them open past about
30 degrees or so.  They open and close easily closer in than that.  They
are about 4 inches in total length, with a fairly wide opening in the back.
The handles bow out from the pivot to a maximum opening of about 2 1/2
inches with the jaws closed.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>140:00:28</b> Young: Hey, Tony?<p>

<b>140:00:29</b> England: Go ahead, John.<p>

<b>140:00:34</b> Young: Did you hear what we said about the UV camera?  Over.<p>

<b>140:00:39</b> England: I got about the UV camera; and we got a procedure all ready that we'll probably ask you to move it back to the north at the end of EVA-2.  You don't think it will be in the Sun before that, do you?<p>

<b>140:00:55</b> Young: It's in the Sun right now.  The lens is in
the...The imagery is in the Sun.<p>

<b>140:01:01</b> England: Okay, we'll probably have you do it right away
when you get out, then.<p>

<b>140:01:08</b> Young: Are you sure this is going to be a normal
EVA-2!?<p>

<b>140:01:11</b> England: Yes, it's a nominal EVA-2 with the exceptions I talked about.<p>

<b>140:01:31</b> Young: Okay, we're just pulling your leg, Tony.  (Tony
laughs)  We'll just play it real time, Tony.<p>

<b>140:01:37</b> England: We're just going to have you rebuild ALSEP and the cosmic ray experiment; otherwise, it is a normal EVA.<p>

<b>140:01:46</b> Young: That's what we're saying.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>140:02:12</b> Duke: If we eat all this meal, Tony, we are not going to
be able to get our suits on.
