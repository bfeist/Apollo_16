<b>145:58:36</b> England: And, Charlie, (we'd like the) DAC, On, as you start driving.<p>

<b><a name="1455840">145:58:40</a></b> Young: Okay.  We're in and we're on our way. <p>

<b>145:58:43</b> Duke: It's already On.<p>

<b>145:58:45</b> England: Okay.  And Station 6 will be completely nominal.<p>

<b>145:58:46</b> Duke: Okay...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>145:58:49</b> Young: Ahhhh.

<blockquote><i>[As per <a href="a16eva2CDR10-11.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR/LMP-11</a>, they are planning a 20-minute stop at Station 6 at the base of Stone Mountain.  Brian MacInall has created a <a href="a16Station5to6TraverseMap_LROC_M175179080LR_May2016.jpg" title="image" target="new">planimetric map</a> of the traverse to Station 6.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:58:50</b> Duke: Okay.  It says 360 at 2.9.  Why don't we just make it 3.5 at 2.9.

<blockquote><i>[As indicated on the <a href="a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new">contour map</a>, they are planning to stop at a LM bearing of 000 (=360) degrees and a range of 2.9 km at map coordinates <a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">BK.6/81.7</a>.  They are currently at a bearing/range of 353/3.5 and near map coordinates BH.7/82.7.  As shown in <a href="a16PPfD23.jpg" title="contour map" target="new">figure D-23</a> in the Professional Paper, Station 6 is a map distance of 600 meters from Station 5 and the average slope is about 7/60 or about 6.7 degrees.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:59:01</b> Young: Okay, Charlie.  I want to follow my tracks down this thing.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's photos taken during the traverse to Station 6 ( <a href="a16trv17585-605LR.pdf">2.8 Mb PDF</a> ) are AS16-108-
<a href="images16.html#17585" target="new">17585</a> to 
<a href="images16.html#17605" target="new">17605</a>.  The first few of these show the outbound Rover tracks.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:59:03</b> Duke: That's fine.<p>

<b>145:59:08</b> Young: Okay, we're riding at idle (meaning that he is not applying any power to the wheels), and she's picking up speed.<p>

<b>145:59:12</b> England: Okay.  And we would like Station 6 at the lowest terrace on Stone Mountain and a blocky crater, if possible.<p>

<b>145:59:27</b> Young: Understand.  The lowest terrace (and) a blocky crater.<p>

<b>145:59:29</b> England: Rog.<p>

<b>145:59:32</b> Young: Charlie, where do you think Stone Mountain takes off in the...<p>

<b>145:59:37</b> Duke: I can see a place down here.  See that...Off to the left, John, by where your tracks came up there....<p>

<b>145:59:43</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>145:59:44</b> Duke: ...There's a pretty big crater, with some blocks around it.  I think that might do.  (Pause)  Okay, Tony, where do you estimate one would be?<p>

<b>146:00:03</b> England: Okay.  You'll be at...<p>

<b>146:00:04</b> Duke: Now, there's one right down there, John.  (At) 12 o'clock, there's one.  About 200 meters.<p>

<b>146:00:11</b> Young: Twelve o'clock, 200 meters?<p>

<b>146:00:12</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>146:00:14</b> England: Okay.  You'll be in the neighborhood and range (at) about 3.0 or a little bit greater.<p>

<b>146:00:25</b> Duke: Okay!<p>

<b>146:00:26</b> Young: I'm just glad that we don't have that watch-the-Rover-go TV.  (Laughing)  Because I don't think we'd be going.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The Apollo 15 crew attempted to send TV signals while they were driving on a steady heading toward Hadley Rille on EVA-3.  That experiment did not work.  John is probably saying that, if Houston had real-time TV of this drive, the NASA managers would be having heart-failure and would make the crew stop and walk down the mountain.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:00:41</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, look in that...<p>

<b>146:00:45</b> Young: Where is it, Charlie?<p>

<b>146:00:46</b> Duke: Just to the left there, John.  See those blocks over there in that crater.<p>

<b>146:00:50</b> Young: Say where.

<blockquote><i>[Because of the limited sideways visibility provide by the suit and John's need to watch the road, he probably can't see where Charlie is pointing and wants a verbal indication of direction.  As he says in a moment, he also has his gold visor down and isn't getting much light.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:00:51</b> Duke: Okay, your 10 o'clock position.<p>

<b>146:00:54</b> Young: That big block there?<p>

<b>146:00:55</b> Duke: No.  Well, on over farther than that.<p>

<b>146:00:56</b> Young: You want to take off and go that way now?  I can't see nothing.  I got my visor down.<p>

<b>146:01:05</b> Duke: Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, now hook a left.  No, not through this crater.  Ha, ha.<p>

<b>146:01:10</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>146:01:13</b> Duke: Right on the other side of this crater.<p>

<b>146:01:14</b> Young: Kind of expect trouble from backseat drivers.<p>

<b>146:01:16</b> England: Yeah, I've noticed that.<p>

<b>146:01:18</b> Duke: Well, that's only 3.3, John.  Why don't we go down a little bit further.<p>

<b>146:01:24</b> Young: This one right here?<p>

<b><a name="1460126">146:01:26</a></b> Duke: Yeah, that one's only 3.3 down.  They think about 3.0.  Turns out it's not a crater at all anyway.  It's just a swale.  (Pause)  There are <i>really</i> some interesting angular blocks here.  (Pause)  Okay, Tony.  It's still apparently...Well, we're steering (on a heading of) about 340 now, and we're getting some angular blocks and cobbles just as we described before.  20 percent of the surface (is covered), perhaps.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's photo AS16-108-
<a href="images16.html#17589" target="new">17589</a> may show some of these blocks.]<p>

[Cobbles are pieces of rock between about 64 mm and 256 mm. He is referring to pieces larger than cobbles as 'blocks'.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:02:13</b> England: Okay.  The nominal Station 4 (means Station 6) would be on a bearing of 356 (based on the known LM location).  (Pause)  But you're going to have to use...<p>

<b>146:02:21</b> Duke: Okay.  That's pretty good.<p>

<b>146:02:22</b> England: ...your own judgment.<p>

<b>146:02:30</b> Duke: We'll veer over that...(Stops to listen)  Okay.<p>

<b>146:02:32</b> Young: 356 at what, Charlie?<p>

<b>146:02:33</b> Duke: At &quot;2.9&quot; it says.<p>

<b>146:02:34</b> England: 3.0.<p>

<b>146:02:39</b> Duke: (Hearing Tony)  3.0.<p>

<b>146:02:41</b> Young: Okay. (Long Pause)  Like driving a camel.<p>

<b>146:02:55</b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[The undulating, cratered terrain is giving them a bouncy ride.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I have to ask.  Had you ever ridden a camel?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Not up to this time.  I've ridden one later, and it
doesn't remind me of riding a camel.  I don't know what he's talking
about.&quot;]<p>

[Journal Contributor David Harland suggests an alternative explanation.  Noting John's &quot;backseat driver&quot; comment at 146:01:14, David writes &quot;John's just been given hasty instructions to make a turn, and went around the 'wrong' side of the crater. For the next minute or so, there is a debate between Duke and England about precisely where they'd best go and, when John says &quot;It's like driving a camel&quot;, John is referring to a camel being 'a horse designed by a committee', and he's saying that he's having to drive with a committee of backseat drivers.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:02:56</b> Duke: And, Tony, over on Smoky (Mountain), it doesn't
appear...I can see the lineations over there, but they're more widely
spaced than (what Charlie saw) on Stone here (from the LM);  and (they're) mostly parallel to the Cayley (meaning that the lineations are horizontal).

(To John) Bear...Bear left a little bit, John, if you can.  Okay, we're at
3(.0 km range).  We can start looking for a place now.<p>

<b><a name="1460332">146:03:32</a></b> Young: Here's the bench right down here, I think. <p>

<b>146:03:33</b> Duke: Yeah, I see it.<p>

<b>146:03:34</b> Young: Do you?<p>

<b>146:03:35</b> Duke: Yeah.  Now if we drive along the bench, maybe we'll find a blocky crater.  (Pause)<p>

<b>146:03:51</b> Young: Want to go right or left?<p>

<b>146:03:53</b> Duke: Left.  (Pause)  Because then Station 8's on over to the left.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As indicated on the <a href="a16.lsp263.jpg" title="image" target="new">contour map</a>, they plan to drive west from Station 6 to get to Station 8.  As shown by the contour map,the bench in the contours runs roughly northeast/southwest on this part of the mountain.]<p>

[After they make the left turn, Charlie takes <a href="images16.html#17600" target="new">AS16-110-17600 and 601</a>. They are driving somewhat left of down-Sun.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:04:05</b> Young: Look at that block there, Charlie!<p>

<b>146:04:06</b> Duke: Where?<p>

<b>146:04:07</b> Young: That big block right over there.<p>

<b>146:04:09</b> Duke: I know it.  That's the one I described.  It's a
giant size.  (Pause)  Okay, Tony.  We're at 3.0 (range) at 355 (bearing). 
Driving west, along a bench, trying to find a blocky crater.<p>

<b>146:04:32</b> England: Okay.  Sounds good.  (Pause)<p>

<b>146:04:43</b> Duke: Passing these big glass-splattered rocks that
apparently came out of South Ray.  (I) think every one of them did,
frankly. (Pause)  Hey, here's a crater here, John, that's about 10 meters
(across), that (has a) fairly blocky rim, angular.  Want to stop here? 
It's a secondary on this side.<p>

<b><a name3="1460519">146:05:19</a></b> Young: Yeah.  What do you think?<p>

<b>146:05:21</b> Duke: Tony, it's a secondary (that was dug by a large piece of South Ray ejecta).  We're at 357 and 3.1, and we got a secondary that's fairly blocky rimmed.  There's one up just a little upslope from us that might be better.  Though there's not as many blocks on the rim.  Same size crater. (Pause)<p>

<b>146:05:44</b> England: Okay; we'd like the more blocky one.<p>

<b>146:05:51</b> Duke: Okay, I think it's a secondary.<p>

<b>146:05:53</b> England: Right, but it might...<p>

<b>146:05:54</b> Duke: Okay, you park a 180 here, John (as indicated on
<a href="a16eva2LMP-11.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-11</a>).<p>

<b>146:05:55</b> England: ...have punched through.<p>

<b>146:05:59</b> Young: Okay; but I can't park 180.  If I park 180, we'll be downslope from it.<p>

<b>146:06:07</b> Duke: No, the crater's over to the left.<p>

<b>146:06:08</b> Young: I know where the crater is.<p>

<b>146:06:10</b> Duke: Oh.  (Pause)  Why, don't you just park north?  I can point that (high-gain) antenna north.<p>

<b>146:06:23</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Because they are near the lunar equator, Earth is not far from the zenith - the current elevation is 77 degrees - and Rover
orientation is not critical in using the sighting scope on the
high-gain.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was it easiest to align the scope if you stood in front
of the Rover.  Did you ever try to do it from the side?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh.  I don't remember it being any easier from the
side or from the front.  I really don't remember what I'm thinking about,
here, when I said 'point the antenna north'.&quot;]<p>

[Most of the pictures we have of astronauts aligning the antenna show
them standing at the front of the vehicle.  Charlie's comment may be
related to variations in lighting conditions with Rover parking
angle.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:06:24</b> Duke: You ought to get over here to the right a little bit so the TV won't be looking into the Sun.  Okay, this is good; yeah.<p>

<b>146:06:37</b> Young: Now I'll just swing around and point it north. How will that be?  There.<p>

<b>146:06:45</b> Duke: That's great.  (Long Pause)  Good show!<p>

<b>146:07:01</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Figure <a href="A16ProfPaperD4f24.jpg" title="image" target="new">24</a> from <a href="A16PP-D4-StoneMountain.pdf" target="new">chapter D4 from the USGS Apollo 16 Professional Paper</a> is a planimetric map of the Station.

<b><a name="1460721">146:07:21</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony; (reading the <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">console</a>)(heading) 180,
(bearing) 357, (distance driven) 6.7, (range) 3.1, 100, 95; amps 0, 0. 
Well, maybe 2 amps each. Batts are 95 and 110; off-scale low, off-scale
low, and off-scale low, off-scale low.  Over.<p>

<b>146:07:31</b> England: Okay; we copy that, and verify DAC off. <p>

<b><a name="1460738">146:07:38</a></b> Duke: Soon as I get out.

<blockquote><i>[The LM is near <a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">CB.1/80.6</a> and a bearing/range of 357/3.1
puts them near <a href="a16.lsp269.jpg" title="image" target="new">BK.6/81.4</a>.  A comparison of Figure 22 in the 
<a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">Professional Paper</a> with 
Pan Camera frame <a href="a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">4623</a> indicates that Station 6
is near BL.8/81.1.  The indicated error is a relatively large 250 meters
and suggests wheel slippage.  For comparison, position estimates for some
easily determined places at the Apollo 17 site show errors of this
magnitude.  See the table at <a href="../a17/a17.trvsta6.html#1644812" target="new">164:48:12</a> in the Apollo 17 Journal.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:07:39</b> England: Okay.  And we'll also need EMU checks here. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>146:07:47</b> Duke: Okay, I don't have any flags; I can't see my quantity.  (Pause)  I've got about sixty-five percent.  Sixty-five percent and (pause) my pressure's good, and I haven't changed my <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">cooling</a>.<p>

<b>146:08:12</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>146:08:22</b> Duke: It's a lot harder.<p>

<b>146:08:23</b> Young: Yeah, I didn't...We didn't sink near...Of course, we're not standing on the rim of a crater.  But this is harder, because we're just sort of bouncing here.<p>

<b>146:10:01</b> Duke: Man, that is some rock.  That matrix there's pure
white, John, with black phenocryst in it.  It might be clast.  It might be
a breccia.  And it's got some lath-like crystals in it.  (Pause)<p>

<b>146:10:29</b> Young: Look at that!<p>

<b>146:10:31</b> Duke: That's the one I'm talking about.  See, I just broke

<b>146:10:40</b> Young: Too hard to whack?<p>

<b>146:10:41</b> Duke: Yeah, I've whacked about five times, as hard as I
could.

<blockquote><i>[<a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> is panning clockwise, stopping every three degrees
so that people in the Backroom can take a picture off the monitors.]<p>

[Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message - &quot;<a href="../JSC-OralHist.html" target="new">Ed Fendell</a> had
control of the TV camera and the principal demand was to watch the
astronaut activities to document what they were doing. At each stop, as
soon as the TV antenna was properly oriented so that we got signal into
Mission Control, Ed would do a 360  pan with the camera as we had
requested. This (pan) was recorded on Polaroid film by Ray Batson and his
photogrammetrists, who were part of our group.  The Polaroid pictures were
put together in a mosaic with important geologic features labeled and
compass orientations marked in grease pencil.  The mosaic was placed in
front of me, usually within 5 minutes of arrival at the station.  This gave
us a visual summary of the immediate region and enabled us, when we didn't
need to watch the astronauts, to ask Ed to move the camera '5 seconds to
the right' - or whatever - and zoom in on a rock or the crater wall, etc. 
That way, we could get better views of the surroundings and offer sampling
or photographic suggestions if we felt that they were
necessary.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:10:44</b> Young: Okay, Houston, it has a white matrix with square
clasts and elongate clasts in it.<p>

<b>146:10:50</b> England: Okay, sounds good.<p>

wouldn't be representative of the whole area.  So, we needed to move away

southeast wall of the crater that is shown in AS16-108-
<a href="images16.html#17624" target="new">17624</a>.  As Fendell pans left to follow John and find Charlie, he pulls back on the zoom.]<p>

[Fendell, from a 1996 interview - &quot;There were some real
interesting little tricks you learned with the thing, once you got the
crewmen up, that you never learned with the training.  And I'll tell you
what that was.  When you look at the video, you'll probably notice that,
the majority of the time when you were watching a crewman, if he started to
move, the first thing the camera does is it opens up.  If you're smart, the
first button you hit was zoom out.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I've noticed you doing that.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;And the reason that worked so great was, when you hit
zoom out, no matter which way he was going, you were able to keep him
within the field-of-view and decide which way he was going.  And that just
came by experience, trying it.  If you hit the zoom out, then you kept the
field open; then you could figure 'he's starting to move left.'  You can do
that and then, as he moves, you follow him and, then, if he stops, you can
zoom down on what he's doing.  And you'll notice that's kind of the way it
happens.  It's kind of an 'Open up, left, right, in, tweak'.  I remember
enough of that.  That's how you handled the delay and the movement of the
crew.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;A nice trick.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;It worked pretty good.  And then we tweaked using
those increment commands.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell - &quot;There was actually two other guys who controlled the
camera at some times on Apollo 16.  A fellow by the name of Al Pennington,
who is a Flight Director over there now.  And a fellow by the name of Gary
Scott, who's not there any more.  But on 15 and 17, I only controlled the
camera.&quot;]<p>

(Standing) I'm sorry we didn't get it documented before, Tony, but that is a good sample.  It's a...I think it's a crystalline rock.  Just a minute...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie plants the scoop and stows the hammer in his pocket.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Does the suit restrict your swinging motion at
all?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, it does!  It's hard to grab the hammer, even. 
Sometimes it'd twist in your hand if you didn't hit it solid.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You're lifting the head up to about helmet height; but
it looks mostly like it's an elbow (bend)...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You couldn't get it up much above that.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It's almost all elbow bend, isn't it?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That's right.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:22:32</b> England: Okay, let's go ahead and document it now. ...<p>

<b>146:22:33</b> Duke: ...let me look at it.<p>

<b>146:22:34</b> England: ...We'll get the location of the one that's still in place (meaning the parent rock).  It didn't look like it moved.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Evidently, Charlie's SCB has come unhooked at the bottom.

<b>146:24:38</b> Duke: Well, I don't know.  Did you get it?<p>

<b>146:24:44</b> Young: Our training bags never did hook.<p>

<b><a name="1462449">146:24:49</a></b> Young: (Garbled)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;We had a real problem with the (individual) sample bags and the Sample Collection Bags (SCBs).  The sample bags were the small ones (that) looked little sandwich bags.  And they were always falling off.  We had a little hook for 'em that fit up on our camera; and they were just unwieldy.  You had a difficult time pulling one off and the ring holder that held them together broke or they would fall off.  And, then, the hooks for the Sample Collection Bag on the side of the PLSS was a real headache - to get it on and to get it off.  It seemed like it took you forever to get it on and then it would just fall off!  Or, you'd try to get it off, and you couldn't get it off.  And it just never seemed to be any rhyme or reason; so, I think, as you go on more extended EVAs, we've got to pay careful attention to the design and development of the latching mechanisms of the sample containers and the hooking mechanism for the backpack - or the shopping bag concept or whatever is decided.  There's got to be a lot of attention to detail put into that.  It's not just a simple matter to get those samples into the bags and the bags collected and stored
somewhere.  I think the most frustrating thing of the whole EVA was that we were always looking for sample bags because they'd fall off.  Finally, on the last EVA, I ended up pushing a few of them on the end of the little finger of my <a href="A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new">glove</a>.  And I tried to operate that way; you know, get em' in my hand some way, so we wouldn't lose 'em.  Because they wouldn't stay on the camera or where we'd placed 'em, because of broken latches and hooks and stuff.  Those are the little things that end up biting you and taking time and interfering with the normal procedures.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Not to mention posing the risk of losing samples and
wasting an enormous amount of time.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Right.  In fact, later on in here, we'll find out that
John's Sample Collection Bag fell off his backpack...Fortunately, when it did it bounced and wedged itself between the frame and the fender of the Rover - or it could have bounced off on the Moon and, you know, it'd have been long gone because we were making a big loop and, to find it, we would have had to retrace our steps - you know, go counter-clockwise - to get back.  If you're just going out and back along the same route, if you lose it on the way out you can find it on the way back.  But, if you lose it on the way back, you get back to the LM and you've got to turn around and go the other way.  Those little details are important when you get down to the
working aspect of an EVA.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:24:50</b> Duke: Okay; I'll put this up.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has the tongs and scoop and is saying that he will stow them on the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:24:52</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>146:24:53</b> Duke: You go get the TV.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie heads for the Rover using his skipping stride and John follows close behind using the loping, foot-to-foot stride.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom to keep them framed.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:24:58</b> Young: Boy, is this a neat way to travel!<p>

<b>146:25:00</b> Duke: Isn't it great?  I like to skip along.<p>

<b>146:25:04</b> Young: Not me, boy.<p>

<b>146:25:08</b> England: Ah, Charlie, you're pure grace.<p>

<b>146:25:09</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  (Scornfully) Skip.<p>

<b>146:25:19</b> Duke: Well, whatever you call it.<p>

<b>146:25:20</b> Young: (Laughing)  Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1462524">146:25:24</a></b> Duke: (Joking) I can't get my left leg in front of me.  Oh, the docs never knew!  (Pause)<p>

<b>146:25:33</b> England: You fooled them again.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Do you have any general comments that you'd like to make at this point, comparing this EVA with the first one?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I think we're a little bit more familiar with the
terrain and the one-sixth gravity.  You know, you get more and more feeling at home.  More confidence in the equipment.  So I think we're working a little bit more efficiently.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You certainly seem to be very relaxed.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah; more organized.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was there a bit more - I don't know if nervousness is
the right word, maybe excitement or adrenaline would be better - during the first EVA?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, I think it was just excitement.  I never had a moment I felt of nervousness; expect for the time when I fell over backwards at the end.  That was scary!&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;More excitement, then, that first day.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  I don't think it was more exciting.  You're just
seeing different things.  It's like you have an exciting trip going to the coast of South Carolina, but you can have an exciting trip going to Idaho, too.  So it's that kind of difference in excitement, I think.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell gets a good close up of John reading his checklist and
turning the page.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:25:34</b> Young: Okay; we're going mode switch to 1.<p>

<blockquote><i>[TV off.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:25:42</b> Young: And the TV is going up to CCW
(counter-clockwise).<p>

<b>146:25:46</b> Duke: Okay; and we've got the...Hey, is the DAC supposed to be on?  Yes, the DAC on.  Okay.  Turning the DAC on.<p>

<b>146:25:57</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1462558">146:25:58</a></b> Duke: The DAC is on, and now watch this big leap.  Oh, oh.  Can't leap.  I'm hooked onto something.<p>

<b><a name="1462615">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1462615.mp3" target="new">3 min 09 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>146:26:15</b> Duke: Oh, you rat!  (Pause)  Sorry, John.  But my seatbelt fell off.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie had the free end of his <a href="a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new">seatbelt</a> hooked to the console or something else convenient and has knocked it off, out of reach.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:26:27</b> Young: Fell off?<p>

<b>146:26:28</b> Duke: Well, it was on the floor.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;When you were seated, could you see things in the footpan?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Only at your feet, you could; you couldn't see close to the seat.  You ended up sitting...When you got in, you were almost stiff.  And then you buckled the seatbelt and then you tightened it in, that sort of helped bend the suit so you could get your rear end back in against the seat.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Of course!&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;What I was talking about there at <a href="#1462558" target="new">25:58</a>, I think, is (that) I was going to leap in.  The way you got into the Rover - for me, anyway - was to hold on to the omni-antenna mast and bounce a couple of times and jump up and sort of pull yourself in; and that just brought you over to the seat and then you'd plop down on the seat.  And I was going to do a big leap, here, but I got a pocket or something hooked on the side of the Rover and I didn't go up.  Then, as I got in the Rover, I said my seatbelt fell off and, then, that's what John was...&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So you couldn't see it and couldn't feel for it, so you
had to get off to get it re-positioned?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, I think so.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Either I'm on the
Rover here and I'm going to leap off and I get hooked on something, or I'm off and I can't get in.  I think I'm in and I can't get off, as a matter of fact, because my seatbelt fell off and I had to get out to retrieve it.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Yeah.  That's what it reads like.  And you just grab on to the Rover and pull yourself up.  I gather that was no problem.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.&quot;]<p>

[The following dialog suggests that after Charlie dismounted and
re-positioned his seatbelt, he tried to jump back on and
fell.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1462640">146:26:40</a></b> Young: Charlie!?<p>

<b>146:26:41</b> Duke: What?  (Pause)  (I) fell down again, John.<p>

<b>146:26:48</b> Young: Yeah, I saw that.  (Pause)  Can you make it?  You want me to get out and help you?<p>

<b>146:26:55</b> Duke: No, I'm getting it now that I'm next to the Rover.  Agh.  My backpack hit the seat and just vaulted me off.  How does my (Hasselblad) camera lens look?<p>

<b>146:27:08</b> Young: Dusty; we'll dust it at the next place. <p>

<b>146:27:10</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>146:27:12</b> England: And, Charlie, we'll need a frame count.<p>

<b>146:27:14</b> Duke: I'm sorry it's taking me...(Stops to listen)  Oh, yeah. <p>

<b>146:27:19</b> Young: Okay, mine is 111.<p>

<b>146:27:24</b> England: Okay, 111.<p>

<b>146:27:29</b> Duke: Fifty for me.<p>

<b><a name="1462731">146:27:31</a></b> Young: Charlie?<p>

<b>146:27:32</b> Duke: What?<p>

<b>146:27:33</b> England: Okay; 50.<p>

<b>146:27:34</b> Young: Your back...We're gonna have to...You knocked off
your whatchacallit, your...<p>

<b>146:27:38</b> Duke: Is that my bag?<p>

<b>146:27:39</b> Young: Yeah, it...Wait a minute.  It's not off, but it
will be in a second.  It's loose.  Turn around and let me see.  No, it's
Velcroed on.<p>

<b>146:27:49</b> Duke: Okay; good.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is probably not on the Rover at this moment.  If he
was, he couldn't have turned far enough for John to see the fastenings on
his SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:27:52</b> Young: That would be bad (to lose a full SCB).<p>

<b><a name="1462757">146:27:57</a></b> Duke: Yeah, wait a minute.  I hate to say it, John, but
I'm going to have to take a minute and fix this Buddy SLSS bag.<p>

<b>146:28:02</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>146:28:03</b> Duke: About to come loose.  (Don't want to) lose that. 
(Pause)  Hey, Tony, we're delaying slightly.  The Buddy SLSS bag was
working loose.<p>

<b>146:28:21</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>146:28:25</b> Duke: Okay, there it is.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Very few of the astronauts remembered much about the Buddy
Secondary Life-Support System.  It was actually a set of hoses that would
allow them to share cooling water in the event of a PLSS failure.  Most
remembered it, dimly, as a way to share oxygen.  Several of them stated
that the lack of a clear memory was an indication that they hadn't believed
it likely that the need to use the BSLSS would arise.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, we had a buddy hose, but I'm not sure whether it
was just one or...Whether it was just cooling water.  I think it was just
cooling water, in case your sublimator or something went out on your PLSS. 
It was a way to stay cool.  And I remember you had about thirty minutes at
regular workload without the LCG before you got heatstroke, I guess.  So we
designed this buddy system.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I gather the BSLSS was stowed behind your
seat.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was hooked behind one of the seats.  It had a little
handle on it, like a little flexible briefcase.  And it was Velcroed
closed, I believe.  What you did is: you took a piece of Velcro from the
back of the seat, stuck it through the handle, wrapped it around a couple
of times and just Velcroed it on.  And it sat there and bounced, actually. 
And, apparently, the Velcro was coming loose or something;  I don't
remember how it was looking, but it began to work it's way loose.  And I
believe it was behind my seat, but I'm not really sure.&quot;]<p>

[The BSLSS bag was stowed behind Charlie's seat, as can be seen in
AS16-108-<a href="images16.html#17729" target="new">17729</a>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Had you done much training on the
disconnects/reconnects in the field?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Not a lot.  But we'd done it enough.  It was a simple
procedure.  We could have done that with no
problem.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:28:40</b> Young: Are you doing okay, Charlie? <p>

<b>146:28:42</b> Duke: Yeah;  I'm doing fine.<p>

<b>146:28:43</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>146:28:44</b> Duke: I just can't get my PLSS back in...There we go.<p>
