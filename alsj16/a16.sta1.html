<b>123:24:08</b> Duke: (To Houston) Okay, your (<a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">console</a>) readings  are (heading) 180, (bearing to the LM) 088, (distance driven) 2.0, (range to the LM) 1.4, (Rover temperatures) 115, 115, 115.  Amps are zero.  Volts are 68, 68, 100, 100.  Rear motor (temperature)s (both) off-scale low; forward motors (both) off-scale low.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;I take it that you're getting the displays while John gets the TV.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;We practiced (with) me reading that off.  That was my
job.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And I think John is aiming the high-gain.&quot;] </i></blockquote>

<b>123:24:30</b> England: Okay, we copy.  You should be about 40 meters from Plum.  Is that right?<p>

<b>123:24:36</b> Duke: No, we're not.  We're right on the rim, if that's
okay with you.<p>

<b>123:24:41</b> England: That's okay.<p>

<b>123:24:42</b> Duke: You can...You can...<p>

<b>123:24:43</b> Young: You'll be able to see everything we do.<p>

<b>123:24:44</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>123:24:46</b> Duke: Okay.  For some reason, I'm not bouncing out of this thing like I thought I would.<p>

<b>123:24:49</b> England: Are you still in the ray material there at Plum? <p>

<b>123:24:55</b> Duke: No.<p>

<b>123:24:57</b> England: Good.  We don't want to be.<p>

<b>123:25:00</b> Duke: The ray material is about 50 meters to the east of us, Tony.<p>

<b>123:25:06</b> England: Outstanding.<p>

<b><a name="1232508">123:25:08</a></b> Duke: (Consulting 
<a href="a16.lmpev123.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-23</a>)  Okay; we saw the boulders at Buster;  we didn't see the northeast(-trending) scarp.  Okay, I got the displays, I'm going to get the pan up on the rim of Flag Crater.  (Pause)  Wow!!  Is that some crater, Tony!  Whooo!  It's a smooth crater, very subdued, but it's really steep, and there's some smaller craters 10 meters or so on the side.  (Static)<p>

<b>123:25:49</b> Duke: I can't even see the bottom right where we are.<p>

<b>123:25:57</b> Young: That is spectacular.<p>

<b>123:26:00</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  The sides are steep enough to cast a shadow from the Sun, so you can estimate from what our Sun angle is what the walls of that are.<p>

<b><a name="1232610">123:26:10</a></b> Young: Hey, is it okay if I turn you around to dust the snow out of your eyes (meaning the TV lens), there?<p>

<b>123:26:15</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's <a href="images16.html#a16pan1232508" target="new">Station 1 pan</a> consists of frames AS16-109-

[Frame <a href="images16.html#17775" target="new">17775</a> is a down-Sun with Flag Crater at the right.]<p>

[Frame <a href="images16.html#17778" target="new">17778</a> shows part of the shadow on the eastern wall of Flag Crater.]<p>

[Frame <a href="images16.html#17781" target="new">17781</a> gives us a view to the north of the east rim of Flag Crater.]<p>

[Frame <a href="images16.html#17784" target="new">17784</a>  is an up-Sun view of a
fairly shallow bowl-shaped crater with shadowing on its eastern wall.  Note
that this shadowing effect actually seems to be produced by overlapping
shadows of small rocks on the rim and inner slope.]<p>

[Frame <a href="images16.html#17788" target="new">17788</a> shows John at the front of the Rover, leaning in to
his right as he dusts.]<p>

[By the time Charlie takes <a href="images16.html#17789" target="new">17789</a>, John has left the Rover and is coming over to join Charlie.  The TV camera is pointed west.  At the right side of the picture, we can see the east wall of Plum Crater with shadows from individual rocks.<p>

[Frame
<a href="images16.html#17790" target="new">17790</a> also shows Plum Crater.  Note the rounded crater on the far wall that has a deep shadow in it.]<p>

[In the distance in 
<a href="images16.html#17791" target="new">17791</a>, we can see the raised rim of South Ray Crater.  Note that the rim crest to rim crest distance is about one fiducial spacing.  South Ray Crater is about 700 meters in diameter and is about 5.5 kilometers south of their present location at Flag Crater.  On the far rim of Plum Crater, note the partially buried boulder, which John and Charlie will sample after they finish their work near the Rover.  This is the boulder that Charlie mentions at <a href="#1232736" target="new">123:27:36</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>123:26:21</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  To the north side of Spook, right on the - I keep calling it Spook - on Flag is a crater right on the inner rim,
that has some blocks in it that are not too big, cobble size (64 - 256 mm) , I'd say.<p>

<b>123:26:40</b> Young: That help any, Houston?<p>

<b>123:26:43</b> England: We don't have a picture yet.<p>

<b>123:26:46</b> Duke: And...<p>

<b>123:26:48</b> Young: (As per 
<a href="a16.lsp065.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-33</a>) Mode switch is in 2.<p>

<b>123:26:51</b> England: Charlie, don't fall in that thing.<p>

<b>123:26:53</b> Duke: I'm not gonna fall in it.<p>

<b>123:27:05</b> Duke: Boy, anybody that judges Cayley Plains as a flatland (laughs) is crazy.  (Pause)  Tony, the sides of this thing get pretty steep.  I'm not going to get down too far, I can't see the bottom of it.  And it's getting so steep I don't want to go any farther.  (Pause)  Okay, Tony...<p>

<b>123:27:34</b> England: Sounds like a good idea, Charlie.<p>

<b><a name="1232736">123:27:36</a></b> Duke: On the southwest flank of Plum, we have a buried boulder (see AS16-109-
<a href="images16.html#17790" target="new">17790</a>), and it's about a meter across.  And that's the only boulder we see of any consequence here at Plum.  In Spook...(Correcting himself) In Flag, on the southwest rim about halfway down into the crater, we see a block that's sticking out, that's very angular, that's maybe 2 meters across, and it's in an area of whiter albedo.  It's probably a buried block.  I wouldn't call it bedrock.  I see nothing that looks like bedrock.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;I don't remember that you ever saw anything that looked like bedrock to you, except at North Ray.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah. North Ray was the only spot.  I wouldn't say that
anything else was.  At North Ray, I think we had some on that far rim, on
the west rim.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:28:15</b> England: Okay, how far down from the rim are you?<p>

<b>123:28:18</b> Duke: Hey, John (garbled)...(Answering Tony) Halfway.<p>

<b>123:28:23</b> England: Okay.  (Comm improves)<p>

<b>123:28:28</b> Duke: Okay; (as per <a href="a16.lmpev123.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-23</a>) rake soil coming up.<p>

<b>123:28:30</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has completed his first pan at a spot indicated by
the circled &quot;1&quot; on 
<a href="a16.lmpev123.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-23</a>.  This is Pan 4, marked with an 'A' in the <a href="images16.html#Sta1Map" target="new">Station 1 plan map</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>123:28:32</b> Duke: And that's done up on Flag.  (Pause)  We can do some sampling and radial along Flag.

<blockquote><i>[The line of Xs north of Plum on LMP-23 indicate a series of samples along a radius extending from Plum.  The box around the
northernmost X may indicate the desired location for a rake sample.  The
numbers &quot;3&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, and &quot;27&quot; that start each of
the three lines related to geology may indicate the numbers of minutes
allotted to each task.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:28:44</b> Duke: Oh, there's a great place for the rake, see, right
up there?<p>

<b>123:28:48</b> Young: Yeah, we don't even...<p>

<b>123:28:50</b> Duke: 12 o'clock?<p>

<b>123:28:52</b> Young: Yup.<p>

<b>123:28:54</b> Duke: Okay, I got the rake.  Let's see, that's all I need.
I can shovel with this (rake).

<blockquote><i>[TV on. <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> is looking at the western horizon.  Because of the down-Sun washout, it is all but impossible to tell that we are looking across to the far wall of Flag Crater.  Fendell starts panning
clockwise.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:28:57</b> England: Our big eye is alive.<p>

<b>123:28:58</b> Young: Okay; let's go.<p>

<b>123:29:02</b> Duke: (Responding)  Ah so, here we go!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As Fendell pans around to the left, we begin to see enough difference in the foreground lighting to see the interior of Plum and a large rock - now known as Big Muley - on the near rim.  Big Muley and a similarly-sized, anonymous rock are shown in a labeled version of AS16-109-<a href="a16-17789det.jpg" title="image" target="new">17789</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>123:29:11</b> Duke: Okay, we're going up (north of the Rover) to where it's more cobbly, Tony, to get the rake sample.  It's pretty smooth right here.

<blockquote><i>[In the distance, we can see the white South Ray ejecta blanket.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:29:18</b> England: Okay, the rake sample should be one crater diameter away from Plum.  And it doesn't have to be...<p>

<b>123:29:24</b> Young: From Plum?<p>

<b>123:29:25</b> England: Right.  And it doesn't have to be too cobbly there.<p>

<b>123:29:29</b> Young: Okay, well...(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The inbound Rover tracks come into view, with Stone Mountain in the background.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:29:34</b> Duke: This is about it then, John.<p>

<b>123:29:35</b> Young: Yeah, but I don't think any of...The rocks from
here may have come from Plum, but they may be (from) some other place, too.<p>

<b>123:29:42</b> Duke: Well, let's do what they want us to do.<p>

<b>123:29:45</b> Young: All right.<p>

<b>123:29:47</b> England: Right; the intent was to get other things than
Plum right there...<p>

<b>123:29:49</b> Duke: How about right out there, in my shadow?  (Pause) There's some right there.  That might be...<p>

<b>123:29:55</b> Young: Sure going to get them.  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1232959">123:29:59</a></b> Duke: Okay, down-Sun, 11-footer.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie may be referring to a decal on his camera which is reproduced in Figure <a href="a16.lsp449.jpg" title="image" target="new">5.3-2</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  A
down-Sun photo, taken toward 12 o'clock, is taken at f/11.  Cross-Sun
photos are taken at f/8 and up-Sun photos at f/5.6.  Figure <a href="a16.lsp192.jpg" title="image" target="new">3.3-1</a> shows
that the standard sampling photo set consists of an f/11 down-Sun taken at an 11-foot focal distance, and a cross-Sun stereopair taken at f/8 from a 7-foot focal distance.  The next frame in the set, which can be taken at any time, is the so-called &quot;Locator&quot; which is a picture of the Rover, the LM, or of a horizon feature so that the sample location can be determined in post-flight analysis.  After the sample is collected, a final photo, called the 'after', is taken at f/8 from 7 feet
cross-Sun.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:30:03</b> Young: Right here, Charlie?<p>

<b>123:30:05</b> Duke: Yeah, that's fine.

<blockquote><i>[Off-camera, John may be putting the gnomon on the rake
site.  Charlie will take a down-Sun photo from 11 feet away while John
takes a cross-Sun stereopair.]<p>

[Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:30:08</b> England: And, John, when you get a chance...<p>

<b>123:30:09</b> Duke: Okay, an eleven footer at (f/)11.<p>

<b>123:30:10</b> England: ...could we get a frame count from you?<p>

<b>123:30:16</b> Duke: Hey, Tony, I'm at (frame) 50, magazine Bravo.<p>

<b>123:30:20</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has mis-spoken.  He is using magazine Golf, also
known as AS16-109.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:30:22</b> Young: Okay, I'm at 10, magazine Bravo.  (Pause) Charlie, you're standing in the shadow.

<blockquote><i>[What John means is that Charlie's shadow is falling on the sample area.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:30:32</b> Duke: Sorry, I'm moving.  Man, it's so easy to get around up here.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reverses direction.  This clockwise pan gives a
superb illustration of the character of the view changes with sun
angle.]<p>

[Charlie's down-Sun is AS16-109-
<a href="images16.html#17794" target="new">17794</a>, which he took after he moved.  Flag Crater is in the
background. John took three cross-Suns from the south: AS16-114-
<a href="images16.html#18389" target="new">18389</a>, 
<a href="images16.html#18390" target="new">18390</a>, and 
<a href="images16.html#18391" target="new">18391</a>.  He stepped to his right after 18389 and back to his left after 18390.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>123:30:38</b> Young: Okay, let's do it.<p>

<b><a name="1233040">123:30:40</a></b> Duke: There's the locator.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's &quot;locator&quot; is AS16-109-

</i></blockquote>

<b>123:30:43</b> Duke: And we'll start the old rake, for the first time! 
Get that beauty right there.  Look at it come through that regolith, would
you?

<blockquote><i>[The dialog over the next several minutes suggest that
Charlie is the one using the rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:30:56</b> England: Charlie, Houston.  We'd like for you to check
your primary water valve...<p>

<b>123:31:00</b> Duke: (Not having heard Tony's second sentence) Go
ahead.<p>

<b>123:31:02</b> England: Make sure it's open.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[This is not the  <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">cooling control</a> but, rather, is the on/off
valve for the primary water supply.  The Primary tank holds about 8.5
pounds of water and the Auxiliary tank holds about 3.5
pounds.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:31:08</b> Duke: Okay, I'll let John check it.  I'm feeling good. 
Nice and cool.  Can you check it?<p>

<b>123:31:15</b> Young: Yeah.  Wait a minute.<p>

<b>123:31:18</b> Duke: I'm not sure it was all the way open.  (Pause)<p>

<b>123:31:28</b> Young: Yeah, it's open, Charlie;  it's all the way
open.<p>

<b>123:31:33</b> England: Okay, we copy that.<p>

<b>123:31:35</b> Young: Houston; it's open all the way.<p>

<b>123:31:38</b> Duke: Yeah, I feel good cooling, Tony.  (To John) Move out and let's get around out of the way there.  Another rake.  Okay, Tony, we got about...(Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1233150">123:31:50</a></b> England: Okay, Charlie.  We think you're about to run out of primary feedwater; stand by for the tone.  Just press on there.<p>

<b>123:31:58</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>123:31:59</b> Duke: Already?!  Is that right?<p>

<b>123:32:04</b> England: That's affirmative.<p>

<b>123:32:06</b> Duke: Go to  <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">Min cooling</a>.  Okay, if y'all been expecting
it.<p>

<b>123:32:19</b> Young: All the way up is Min, isn't it, Houston?

<blockquote><i>[According to the Apollo 16 Mission Report, Charlie is using feedwater at a much higher rate than John.  See, also, the dialog at <a href="a16.trvsta2.html#1241438" target="new">124:14:38</a>.  During this first EVA, Charlie will use 11.62 pounds of water while John will use only 9.08 pounds.  Pre-flight estimates indicated they would both use 9.04 pounds.  Charlie will have about 0.42 pounds of water remaining at the end of the EVA.  The EVA started at <a href="a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new">118:53:33</a> and, consequently, they are about 279 minutes into what will be a 431-minute EVA.  John will switch to Aux water at some point after 
<a href="a16.trvlm1.html#1250015" target="new">125:00:15</a>,
which is 367 minutes into the EVA.  The Primary Water tank holds about 8 pounds.  During the 444 minutes of EVA-2, John will use 9.48 pound and Charlie will use 10.28; and during the 341 minutes of EVA-3, John will use 8.21 pounds and Charlie will use 8.38 pounds.]<p>

[Fendell is looking across Plum Crater with Big Muley on the left side of the TV pictures and, near the center on the far rim, a flat, white rock that John and Charlie will sample later in their Station 1 activities.  Photos AS16-114-

<b>123:32:21</b> Duke: Yeah.  Wait a minute; I'm losing all of those (rocks).<p>

<b>123:32:26</b> Young: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[From the evidence of rake samples taken later in this mission and on other missions, after each swath Charlie raises the rake and shakes the loose soil out.  Rocks larger than about 1 cm will stay in the rake and, apparently, most of the rocks Charlie is sweeping up are smaller than that.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:32:27</b> Duke: There's three little ones.<p>

<b>123:32:30</b> Young: Two little ones, now.  (Pause)<p>

<b>123:32:36</b> Young: Okay, we better get another one.<p>

<b>123:32:38</b> Duke: Yup.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie will rake a few more swaths.]<p>

[As Fendell pans through northwest, we begin to see features on the far
wall of Flag Crater.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Flag Crater is almost washed away, here.  It's hard to see
when you look at zero-phase.  And that's a big crater, you know, a couple
hundred meters across and, until you get up towards the north, you really
can't even see it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:32:54</b> Duke: There's a pretty good...<p>

<b>123:32:55</b> Young: (Lost under Charlie)<p>

<b>123:32:57</b> Duke: John, there's a glassy one right there.  I can't
tell what the other ones are.<p>

<b>123:33:02</b> Young: I can't either.  They're all dust coated.  Do you
want me to go low or high or what?

<blockquote><i>[John is probably asking if Charlie wants him to hold the
individual sample bag at waist height or at knee height while Charlie pours
in the collected rocks.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:33:07</b> Duke: No, that's fine.<p>

<b>123:33:10</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1233312">123:33:12</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony, we got about a half a sackful going in bag...(To John) What is it?<p>

<b>123:33:18</b> Duke: (Correcting John)  372.<p>

<b>123:33:22</b> Duke: 372 with three rakes (meaning three swaths).  Over.<p>

<b>123:33:38</b> England: Okay, we copy.  I take it the soil isn't too
cohesive here.

<b>123:40:45</b> Duke: Okay.  Here's one right here, John, that'll make a
good one.  See that one right there by that footprint?  That's a good
sample size.  About 5 centimeters across?

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Why are you saying 5 cm is a good sample size?  Small enough that it would go in the bag?  And big enough so that they'd have something to work with?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, and it's characteristic of the rocks (that help
determine the desired size).  You know, if you get it too small, you
wouldn't have the clasts and all.  But 5 cm - a couple of inches - gave you some clasts and breccia fragments and stuff like that.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So, basically, you wanted to get the biggest thing that would fit in the bag.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, that's what we tried to do.  Yeah.  Except for the rake sample.  The rake would trap things that were, I think, above a half-inch.

I don't now what the spacing between the tines were (1 cm = 0.4 in), but anything smaller than that spacing would fall out.  So it basically graded itself.  And the shovel, you basically just picked up what was there.  But the samples we tried to take were bigger.&quot;]<p>

[Houston decides that they won't see much of what John and Charlie and doing; so Fendell begins a counter-clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

He then moves his left hand down the handle and, finally, is able to grab the rock with his right hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:47:09</b> Young: Well, my first guess is it is a breccia with white clast in it.  And I see lineations all along it...in the breccia.  (Pause)  It's a white-clast breccia is what it is.  I see no other clasts in it.  Of course, once you get the dirt off of it might all be white.  At first cut, it would be a white-clast breccia.  Going into 362.

<b><a name="1234744">123:47:44</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  This one - same spot - is a breccia with a white matrix that's glass coated on one side.  And (it's a) thin, typical lunar-surface glass coating.

[Jones - &quot;Did a lot of the rocks have glass coatings?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  In our area they did.  I don't remember whether it was the rocks had melted themselves or whether there was a hot rock that just splashed on it and coated it with glass.  It was a little of both, I think.  This one probably had a glass coating; it looked like something had
splashed over it, a lot of times, and solidified.  That big House Rock on
the last EVA (at North Ray Crater), I remember distinctly, it was glass. 
The rock itself was glass, which is almost like obsidian, which indicates
that the rock got real hot and it was vitrified.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;What Jack describes sometimes on 17 is places where you get a small meteorite come in and hit the surface of a rock and you get a
little splash around the sides of the crater.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That could have been one of the processes.  They had a
special name for that, and I forget the name for these micrometeorites that hit the rock.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Zap-pits&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Zap-pits.  Yeah, that was it.  And we saw some of that. 
Yeah.  I think we describe it later on.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And then there were ones with more of a complete
(coating)...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It had splashed, yeah.  We'd seen that out in Hawaii - you
know, liquid lava come out and splash around.  That's what it looked like
to me.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[The bright, white color of the sunlit wall of the footprint can be seen in the TV picture]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:51:10</b> Young: Well, take your old thing (meaning the scoop) and do an exploratory (trench) there for a while.<p>

<b>123:51:18</b> Young: Oh, if it's...

<blockquote><i>[The local surface rises from the area of the Rover west to the Plum rim.  The footprint is near the rim and Charlie positions himself slightly downhill of the footprint.  He sticks the scoop head in the ground, with the flat, bottom surface of the scoop rimward, and pulls the scoop toward the Rover to create a vertical, sunlit face.  The soil he removes with the scoop is noticeably brighter than the normal regolith it falls on.  Note that Charlie has to use both hands on the scoop to do the
trenching.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was easy for me that way.  I didn't have the

<b>123:51:45</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, let me describe what it is.  The top centimeter of the regolith is gray, and you get down under that, and it's white.<p>

<b>123:51:58</b> England: Roger; we copy that.

<blockquote><i>[John gives the scoop to Charlie and goes to the Rover, carrying the gnomon with him.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:51:59</b> Duke: It's a lot different albedo (than the normal surface);  three shades different (on the gray scale attached to the gnomon).<p>

<b>123:52:06</b> England: Right, we can.<p>

<b>123:52:09</b> Duke: I'll dig you a little trench here.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie starts a trench slightly south of the place where he first dug.  He positions the scoop with each stroke so that he can create a vertical wall facing the Sun.  On his third stroke, he manages to pull himself forward and off balance, but avoids the trench by taking a step forward and then hopping onward to regain his balance.  He ends up northwest of the trench.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;As you dug trench, two-handed again, it looked like you actually pulled yourself forward slightly.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, I did.  I got it down and it jerked me
forward.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You rotated forward over your feet real slow.  And
eventually got over your toes and had to walk forward two or three steps.  That's amazing how much time you had to react to things like
that.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  It was sort of a slow motion, everything felt
like.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:52:13</b> Duke: Boy, that's going to be a hard job, John.  (Pause)  Can you see that, Houston?  We'll sample right there and get you a scoopful of this underlying regolith.<p>

<b>123:52:28</b> England: Okay, I guess...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie hops sideways and stops north of the
trench.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:52:30</b> Duke: It really is a different albedo; it's amazing.<p>

<b>123:52:33</b> England: Right; we can see that here.

<blockquote><i>[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;There was about 3 cm of gray regolith and, right under that, it was just white ash.  It was white when we put it in the bag.  I don't know what it looks like right now; but it was white when we put it in the bag.  Just ash white.&quot;]<p>

[Mattingly, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Some of the other things that looked white, when we got them inside (the CM), (they) were pretty black.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;If it doesn't look white, I'll eat every bit.&quot;]<p>

[Unidentified speaker, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was sure marshmellowy (meaning 'very white') when we got it.&quot;]<p>

[The unidentified speaker is probably saying that the sample looked bright white when inspected in the Lunar Receiving Lab in
Houston.]<p>

[The following discussion of the possible origin on the white soil and the covering layer comes from the Apollo 16 Preliminary Science Report: &quot;The median grain size of most soil samples ranges from 76 to 112/am. However, the two samples from North Ray Crater (<a href="LunarSampleCompendium67481.pdf" target="new">67480</a> and <a href="LunarSampleCompendium67601.pdf" target="new">67600</a>) and one whitish soil from station 1 (<a href="A16_61220_53.pdf" target="new">Sample 61220</a>) are much coarser; the median grain size ranges from 250 to 300 microns.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;It is noteworthy that the three coarser soils all have relatively low abundances of agglutinates as well as relatively low nickel contents. The concurrence of these three parameters suggests that these soils have been subject to gardening for a much shorter time than the typical soft. The occurrence of an immature soil in the bottom of the trench at station 1 (sample 61220) suggests that remnants of relatively young rays from North Ray Crater may be overlain by mature soils ejected from small shallow craters. If this interpretation of the North Ray Crater soils is accepted, it is clearly distinguishable from soil interpreted as South Ray Crater ejecta, which contains dark brown to black vesicular glass droplets and dark gray breccias.&quot;]<p>

[On <a href="A16PP-D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new">page 78</a> of the USGS Professional Paper, exposure ages of North Ray samples - and, presumably the age of the crater itself - are said to be in the range of 30 - 60 million years.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:52:34</b> England: Why don't you go ahead and get a bag of the dark and a bag of the light, and then we'll press on to that block on the northwest side (of Plum).<p>

<b>123:52:42</b> Duke: All right.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John reappears and sets the gnomon just west of the trench.  The color scale on the sunward leg is clearly visible.  He backs off-camera to the left to take cross-Sun pictures and Charlie backs off-camera to the right to get the down-Sun.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:52:47</b> England: Boy, my kids don't get as dirty as you are.<p>

<b>123:52:52</b> Duke: (Laughing)  Well, I bet they don't have as much fun, either.<p>

<b>123:53:10</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>123:53:11</b> Duke: There we go.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie skims the top centimeter or two off the surface west of the trench, pushing the scoop forward with his left hand.  He raises the scoop without touching it at all with  his right hand until the scoop handle is horizontal.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:53:14</b> Duke: Ah, look at that finger.  Picked that up with one finger!<p>

<b>123:53:18</b> England: Ah, the delicate touch.

<blockquote><i>[Now using his right hand to keep the scoop handle steady, Charlie turns to his left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:53:19</b> Young: Wait a minute, Charlie.  I've got to get the bag out.<p>

<b>123:53:22</b> Duke: John, we're going to have to change that bag dispenser.  That is terrible.<p>

<b>123:53:25</b> Young: Is there another one?  Do we have another one?<p>

<b>123:53:27</b> Duke: Yeah, we have another one under my seat.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;The bags kept breaking.  They hook on your camera; and they had a little ring.  And you try to pull one off and you'd get a couple.  And then, sometimes you'd be running along and they'd just flip off!  And then sometimes, the ring would pull out and all the bags would fall away.  They'd still be together, but they'd just be loose and I remember one time (during EVA-3) we ended up carrying them on the end of our little finger and using it that way.  The same thing had been reported on all the other missions: that the bags are just crappy and they fall off.

The mechanism that holds them together would break, so it was a lousy design, I thought.  Or, at least, lousy manufacture.  It got worse and worse, actually; this is just the beginning.&quot;]<p>

[The following comes from the Apollo 16 Mission Report. &quot;The three screws which fasten the bag ring to the bracket plate had come out on one of the documented sample bag dispensers and consequently came apart when unstowed.  The three flat-headed stainless steel screws mate with threads in the aluminum rings (Fig <a href="a16mrf14-61.jpg" title="image" target="new">14-61</a>).  The heads are staked to the aluminum bracket plate.  Thread sealant materials are not permitted because of the possibility of lunar sample contamination.  The Apollo 17 dispensers will
be re-inspected to assure proper staking of the screws and tightness of the threads in the aluminum ring.&quot;]<p>

[The Apollo 17 crew did not experience a repeat of this problem.]<p>

[See also, the discussion at <a href="a16.lrvload.html#1201239" target="new">120:12:39</a> covering the mechanism by which the dispensers were attached to the cameras.]<p>

[John finally gets a bag ready and Charlie tilts the scoop up and shakes it a couple of times to get the soil to slide into the bag.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:53:39</b> Duke: Okay?<p>

<b>123:53:40</b> Young: Okay.  That top scoop is going in bag 352, Houston.<p>

<b>123:53:44</b> England: Okay, 352.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[While John &quot;Z&quot;s the bag, Charlie takes a big jump backwards to get in position to take a sample of the white soil.  However, he then realizes that John has to get rid of bag 352 before they can bag another sample and steps over to John and presents his
SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Charlie turns and hops back into his sampling position.  John works to get another bag off the dispenser.]<p>   

[Duke - &quot;We wasted a lot of time, here.  John got this sample; then I had to walk over and turn sideways to him and he had to drop it in my bag and then I had to go back and get another sample.  Our idea in training - and they never would approve - was the old shopping bag.&quot;]<p>

[See the discussion at they have at Shadow Rock at <a href="a16.sta13.html#1683352" target="new">168:33:52</a>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So you'd talked about that ahead of time.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You know, with the straps.  And when you pick it up it closes up.  They didn't buy that idea; and we ended up taking the sample bags (meaning the SCBs) and running around the Moon and just putting them on the ground.  And we could open it up and put our own bags in, and that was really helpful when we sampled by ourselves.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;There's a discussion of that at Shadow Rock.  I thought that was a spur of the moment discussion of yours about the grocery bag but you actually had talked about it before the flight?&quot;]<p>

The regolith looks real deep here; you can see a couple of footprints - on one side any way - that's a couple of inches.  You know, we thought that rock had come in from somewhere and it had either come out of Flag and then was covered with dust from a more recent cratering event, perhaps even South Ray.  Or it was sort of a bedrock; it looks like it's a sort of bigger rock that's been there for a while.  So we don't really
know.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

the hammer.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah.  In training, every time we got to a rock he'd
whack it.  He was really excited about using the hammer when we got to the Moon, 'cause he'd used it a lot in training, whacking off chunks of
rock.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And he got pretty good at it?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Pretty good, yeah.  Actually, it was pretty hard to hammer. 
The core tubes, I ended up doing a lot hammering; and I ended up having to
go two hands because it got real tired as you held that hammer and tried to hit; you'd get cramps and weaker in the forearm.  At least I would.  So I'd end up, a lot of times, hammering - at least core tubes - with two
hands.&quot;]<p>

up and going sideways.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;The only time you didn't want to back up too much was when
you were unsure where you were and you could back into a crater.  You know,
it was real easy to move - forward, backward, sideways.&quot;]<p>

[Charlie reaches forward, plants the scoop head about 1.5 meters ahead of his feet, and then sinks to his knees.  Initially, he has his back aligned vertically but is unable to reach the fragment.  He moves himself about 30  cm to his right, leans forward until his back is about 30 degrees off vertical, and grabs the fragment with his right hand without trouble.]</i></blockquote>

<b>123:59:22</b> Duke: I got it (by) leaning on the shovel.  (Pause)

<b>123:59:29</b> Duke: (Examining the fragment) Okay, Houston, it's got some green clasts, some white clasts, a grayish matrix.  The clasts are millimeter size and make up 5 percent of the rock.  (Pause)  One big
crystal, 5 millimeters across, but I can't tell what it is.  But it's a
beauty.

<blockquote><i>[Great Scott is a 9.6 kg basalt that Dave Scott
collected at the edge of Hadley Rille.  At the time, it was the
largest Apollo sample, having surpassed a 9.0 kg Apollo 14 breccia known as Big Bertha.

The largest Apollo 17 sample was 70215, an 8.1 kg basalt, so Big Muley retained the record.

<b>124:07:56</b> Young: Are you sure you want a rock that big, Houston? (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stands at rest, leaning slightly forward on the scoop while he waits for an answer.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1240801">124:08:01</a></b> England: Yeah, let's go ahead and get it.<p>

<b>124:08:03</b> Young: That's 20 (9.1 kg) pounds of rock right there.<p>

<b>124:08:05</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<b>124:08:13</b> Young: It sure has.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie can't get his hand low enough to get under the rock, so he uses the tips of his fingers to try to roll it up onto his thigh.  It falls off.  He then strains forward until he can get his hand curved around the rock far enough that he can, at least, press it against his leg and, finally, <a href="a16.muley.jpg" title="image" target="new">he stands</a> (video still by Ken Glover).  Dave Scott used a similar technique when he  <a hef="../a15/a15.rille.html#1660900" target="new">collected Great Scott</a>]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:08:27</b> Duke: Agh!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie plants the scoop, gets his left hand under the camera and does a little jump so that the rock floats upward far enough that he can get a solid grip with both hands.  The Hasselblad is clearly getting in the way.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1240829">124:08:29</a></b> Duke: If I fall into Plum Crater getting this rock, Muehlberger has had it.<p>

<b>124:08:37</b> England: We agree.

<blockquote><i>[Bill Muehlberger is the Principal Investigator for Apollo 16 geology.  As is discussed at <a href="a16.eva1post.html#1271610" target="new">127:16:10</a>, Big Muley is named for him.]<p>

[Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter and a 1997 e-mail message - &quot;Big Muley was a problem from the moment we saw it on TV. The crew had been told to pick up nothing larger than their fist - the lab types could analyze remarkably small pieces and get reproducible results.  So, when we spotted Big Muley with the television camera and saw what looked like a large rectangle flashing at us, we jumped to the conclusion that it was a crystal - or cleavage - face of plagioclase feldspar. That made the rock an anorthosite which, according to our pre-mission interpretations, should not be present at this landing site. Further, there was a small crater on our side (between the Rover and Big Muley) that we thought could be a bounce crater caused by this rock on landing. The direction suggested that this could have been from Theophilus, a large, relatively young  crater that had been proposed as a source for some material that might be scattered across the landing area.  So, I put in a request for the crew to pick it up as they returned to the LRV.  We had no idea of size  - it was the first sampling stop on the mission - but, once the crew got close, we realized that it was bigger than the max size suggested for return from the Moon  And then Charlie started complaining about it(s size) and about his struggle to pick it up.  It turned out to be the largest rock returned from the Moon!  And it turned out to be a useful rock for the researchers.&quot;]<p>

[Charlie is now able to cradle the rock against his side with his right
hand.  He grabs the scoop and heads for the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:08:39</b> Duke: Okay; I've got it!  That's 20 pounds of rock!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;That's a nice sequence there of you picking up Big Muley.  It didn't look like you had stability problems at all.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, I was a little over the rim, down inside and so I was a
little bit below the rock, which really helped.  When you could get below
something, it really helped.  And then, of course, I was leaning on the
shovel with my left hand.  And I was trying to roll it up my leg; but I
never could get it up past the stuff down in here, which I think was part
of the camera and stuff.  But I was able to hold it against myself.  You
know, we really didn't particularly want to carry it, but they said bring
it back.  'Cause it was a big rock; you know, we only had 200 pounds or so
we needed to collect and it turned out, when we got back (in the LM) there
was a big debate: maybe we'll have to throw something out.  But then they
changed their mind.  But we weighed everything, you know, and we were over our limit.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell pulls back on the zoom and starts panning
counter-clockwise.]</i></blockquote>

<b>124:08:48</b> Young: You want to put it in here, Charlie?  I'd just as
soon you didn't.  Look at the size of that moose!<p>

<b>124:08:53</b> Duke: I know it.  (Pause)  Oh, Tony!  It's got some
beautiful crystals in it though.  That was a good guess.<p>

<b>124:09:02</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>124:09:07</b> Duke: Okay, put it in there, John.<p>

<b>124:09:10</b> Young: Put it in where?<p>

<b>124:09:11</b> Duke: In your SCB.<p>

<b>124:09:13</b> Young: I don't think it'll fit.  (Pause)  Don't think it
will fit.  (Pause)

<b>124:11:30</b> Young: Yeah, make sure you're in Min I guess, before we get in and start driving.<p>

<b>124:11:35</b> Duke: Yeah.  Going to Min.  That's a good point.

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;It really cinched you in there.  It had a good
over center position and it was easy to operate.  And it had a big hook on
it so you could just reach over and hook on the outside handle of your
seat, which was real easy to do.  You really couldn't see it; you were
working blind.  And, then, that big handle would give an over center lock
and it really cinched you in there firm.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
