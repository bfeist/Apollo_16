<b>144:09:46</b> Duke: (Scanning LMP-9)  Okay, (I) got the (Rover) display.  Okay, I'm around to get the 500 (from under the CDR seat).  Tony, you just can't believe this!  You just can't believe this view!  You can see the lunar module  (see AS16-112-
<a href="images16.html#18272" target="new">18272</a>);  you can see North Ray with boulders on the southwest side; and where Station 12 is, there's one huge boulder (House Rock) that's going to be just great.

<blockquote><i>[In AS16-112-
<a href="images16.html#18272" target="new">18272</a>, 
<a href="a16.pan4623nlbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">House Rock</a> is the very large boulder just above and to the right of the central fiducial.  The boulder is about 9.5 kilometers from Station 4 and is about 12 meters tall.

In the foreground, the LM is about 4.3 km from Station 4 and is 7 meters tall.  As can be seen from a comparison of <a href="a16ppD1f3.jpg" title="image" target="new">chapter D1 / figure 3</a> and <a href="a16ppD4f23.jpg" title="image" target="new">chapter D4 / figure 23</a> from the USGS Apollo 16 Professional Paper, they are about 140 meters above the LM.]<p>

<b>144:10:12</b> Duke: It looks like we can get up there (with the Rover), and there's a great ray pattern going up the side of Smoky Mountain from North Ray.<p>

<b>144:10:24</b> England: Sounds fantastic.  That 500 millimeter (lens) should do a job for us.<p>

<b>144:10:29</b> Duke: Oh, I hope so.  I can see super into...<p>

could be standing away and you could look into the scope.  I mean,  you
didn't have to get right up next to it.  (From) two or three feet away, you

from downslope.  And I just looked in there and pointed it
up.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:10:56</b> Duke: Okay, John.  I got this roll thing (meaning the pitch/roll meter) working again.<p>

<b>144:10:59</b> Young: You did, huh?<p>

<b>144:11:00</b> Duke: Yeah.  Hold still, and let me -  Okay, Tony.  The roll...(I) hit the thing.  The roll is 4 degrees left.  That was a great estimate on John's part.  And the pitch scale is falling off, but the needle is in the center.<p>

<b>144:11:32</b> Young: I'd say it's about - from my gravity gradients and looking at the LCRU - I'd say it's about 3 degrees pitched down.  (Revising his estimate) 4 degrees pitched down.<p>

<b>144:11:42</b> England: Okay, we copy that.<p>

<b>144:11:43</b> Duke: Oh, wait a minute.  Do you want me to get the high gain.<p>

<b>144:11:46</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>144:11:51</b> England: And while you're playing around the LRV there, how about the Volt/Amp (gauge) switched to Amp.<p>

<b>144:12:01</b> Duke: Okay, I did that.  They're low.<p>

<b>144:12:04</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>144:12:12</b> Duke: Okay.  We weren't pointed at it.<p>

<b>114:12:13</b> Young: Charlie.  It's too hard to do this way.  We have to use the (signal strength)...<p>

<b>144:12:19</b> Duke: We can go at it from right here, John.  (Pause;  Static clears)<p>

<b>144:12:40</b> Duke: Hey, Tony.  That thing's a piece of cake for aligning it at (a Rover heading of) 270.<p>

<b>144:12:48</b> England: Okay, that's good news.

<blockquote><i>[The TV camera is pointing more or less over the right front fender.  John is reading his checklist and Charlie is just off-camera to the left getting the 500-mm camera.

<b>144:12:56</b> Duke: Okay, starting with the 500.  I'm going to Intermediate...I mean, (the) <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">Min position on the cooling</a>.<p>

<b>144:13:02</b> Young: (Reading <a href="a16eva2CDR8-9.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-9</a>)  Okay, and &quot;dust&quot;.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes off-camera to the right to take his 500-mm shots.  Evidently, John decides not to dust the Rover.  Either that or he did the dusting while Charlie was aiming the high-gain.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:13:06</b> Duke: Tony, you can see the rays of South Ray come out across the landscape, albedo-wise.  And it's really predominant.  They cross right across...Go right up Survey (Ridge), and it's definitely ray pattern that we were crossing (during the drive from the LM).  Okay, (reading <a href="a16eva2LMP-09.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-9</a>) &quot;500 of Stubby, 15 (pictures)&quot; and...That's not worth 15 pictures, Tony.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie does not take pictures of Stubby to start but, rather, starts with some pictures of 
<a href="a16_lpi_trvrsmap.gif" title="image" target="new">South Ray Crater</a>.  As can be seen in the <a href="a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">Stubby pictures</a> described below, there are few shadows and, hence, little visible detail in the crater.]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Stubby was a very old, subdued, tired-looking crater and it wasn't much but regolith.  I got pictures of Stubby, but there was no lineation, no evidence of outcrop, no evidence of anything except old, tired-looking things.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I got the feeling from looking at Stubby that it was there (meaning it was formed) after Descartes was because of the way the slope was off the mountain around Stubby.  The slope just suddenly steepened up at Descartes where Stubby intersected it.  That could be erroneous, but that's the only reasonable conclusion that I could come to.  The rim of Stubby bisected - or cut off - some of Stone Mountain.&quot;]<p>

[One pre-mission hypothesis about Stone Mountain was that the mountain was a relatively recent volcanic construct.  If, however, an old crater like Stubby cuts into the mountain, the mountain must be very old.  The astronauts all received a great deal of training in the principle of &quot;superposition&quot; - what's on top of what - a key to determining the relative ages of geologic features.]<p>

[John gets the gnomon from behind his seat and turns his back to us as he looks for an appropriate place to start sampling.  We get a glimpse of the opening in the thermal layer that allows water vapor to escape the sublimator.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;The sublimator (opening) looks like it's covered.  With gauze or something so you don't get a lot of dirt in there.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That bottom one is a strap and you can see, right above that, there's a little line and that's just a light covering over it, I think.  See that line?&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Maybe three or four inches below the top of the PLSS and two inches or so above the strap.&quot;]<p>

[There is another opening in the thermal cover on the front of the PLSS behind the astronaut's neck.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:13:39</b> England: (Passing on a request from the Backroom)  And, John, before you start sampling...<p>

<b>144:13:42</b> Duke: Can't see much.<p>

<b>144:13:44</b> England: ...could you give us a general impression of the rock types?<p>

<b>144:13:49</b> Young: And, it looks to me like this rock pile that we're seeing in there is about the same type of rock.  I...(Pause)  As you can see, they're angular.  Let me go over there and look at this big one.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans right as John walks away from the
Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:14:10</b> Young: I think they're right friable.  They have a very shocked appearance.  There's a boulder we could turn over, Charlie.<p>

<b>144:14:20</b> Duke: That's what I was saying.  That a big one.  Right behind us.<p>

<b>144:14:24</b> Young: The trouble is, I don't want to push it into the Rover.

<blockquote><i>[Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message - &quot;You ask about the Backroom. I suspect my predecessor as P.I. for Apollo Field Geology, Gordon Swann, was the major hand in the design of the team that I inherited for Apollo 16-17.  He was also involved in the early Apollo Missions besides being P.I. for Apollo 14-15.  My team consisted of individuals who had done the same jobs on prior missions, so I had a well-trained team to start.  What an asset!!!&quot;]<p>

[&quot;I sat at a table facing Jim Lovell - who was in charge of the Science Backroom - with Dale Jackson and <a href="../lee_silver.html" target="new">Lee Silver</a> - both brilliant geologists - on either side of me as my brain trust, who would offer advise as needed.  Behind me was Bob Sutton, who was generating a card file concerning each sample collected (material he used later in his work to orient as many samples as possible into their original lunar positions).  These cards were useful to me for quick review of what had been collected to that point - i.e. were there types of rocks that were being shorted in the sampling?  Off to the left was George Ulrich at a big table covered with the map of the landing site.  On it he kept track of the crew's position, list of tasks to be done at a given station, the times for when they arrived at the station and when they were supposed to leave for the next station.  All of this info was transmitted to the main mission control and put up on the big screens at the front of mission control.  Ours was the leftmost screen and thus was never seen on public TV.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;When we wanted to send a message to the crew, we first had to convince Jim Lovell that it was important, then he would initial our note that was then placed under the TV that was over our map so that the CapCom could see it.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;When Lovell called the Flight Director and he approved it, Flight then OK'd the CapCom to insert the message into the ongoing conversation whenever he felt that it wouldn't break a chain of thought.  Off to my right in front of an overhead projector was Tim Hait who kept notes in chronological order that were projected onto the wall so that, if we got involved in something and lost track of what was happening, we could look at the wall and see the time the note was taken and what was the geological subject.  There were also representatives of the lunar sample community behind who were people always pushing for their special requirements on sampling.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;In another room we had a photogrammetry team who were involved with compiling Polaroid pictures from the lunar TV camera panoramas, annotating them for interesting rocks or geological features, placing these pans in front of me within minutes of when they had been taken, pointed out the features and we then tried to have the camera study these rocks when it wasn't deemed necessary to watch the crew.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;We also had a team of court reporters who took the entire EVA transcripts, and furnished us with the printouts for use. They were available within days whereas the NASA transcript was months away.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;In another room, we had a team of geologists whose only job was to watch the TV, listen to what was happening, phone us if they had any brilliant ideas that had escaped us, write up a summary of the EVA that was distributed throughout Mission Control before the crew had gone to sleep, and modify the pre-planned EVA coming up to fill in the sampling, photography, etc., that had been missed the first time. On Apollo 16, Dallas Peck - later to become Director, U.S. Geological Survey - and that team wrote a position paper on why EVA-3 could NOT be canceled and that the MAIN purpose of the landing was to get to North Ray crater because it gave us a deep hole into the Descartes that could not be gotten anywhere else in the landing site.  The position paper was successful and we got a shortened but acceptable quick run traverse to North Ray.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;So, that describes the main aspects of my team during the missions. A great bunch, all willing to work as long as needed to make sure that the job was done well.  I can never thank them enough; after all, the boss gets the credit, but its the team that did the job.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell finds Charlie, who is taking 500-mm photos.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1441429">144:14:29</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  I'm taking some 500s of South Ray.  I can see into the rim on the inner wall on the south side.  And the characteristics of the thing:  it's got black streaks and white streaks coming out of the wall right over the rim, which says to me, there's two types of rocks down there.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's

<a href="a16.babyray.jpg" title="image" target="new">Baby Ray Crater</a>.]<p>

[Fendell has continued his clockwise pan and we have a good view of the bright-white South Ray ejecta blanket.  The TV picture is not good enough, however, to show the dark streaks that John discusses in his next transmission.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:14:52</b> Young: That's right, Charlie.  That's what it says.  And that's why your dark streaks show up on your photographs.  It's not that that thing wasn't throwing out blocks in every which direction.  That dark streak right down through the middle of our photograph - that looks (to be) the darkest in the area - is probably dark material from South Ray.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is probably referring to 
<a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 3.6.2-3</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures volume.  John's hypothesis is probably not correct.  Analyses described in USGS Professional Paper 1048, &quot;Geology of the Apollo 16 Area, Central Lunar Highlands&quot; indicate that the bright rays are characterized by significantly higher concentrations of blocks (larger than about 2 cm) than the dark, inter-ray areas.  In addition, there are indications that very little of the ray material is in the form of fine particles.  Apparently, the dark, inter-ray areas are relatively devoid of South Ray ejecta.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1441520">144:15:20</a></b> Duke: Tony, 
<a href="a16.site-s.jpg" title="image" target="new">Stubby</a> is a very subdued, old crater.  It's not worth 15 pictures really.  It's not much to it.<p>

<b>144:15:35</b> England: Okay, copy that.<p>

<b>144:15:36</b> Duke: No outcrop at all.  I see some secondaries in the inner flank.<p>

called the penetrometer to determine various mechanical properties of the
soil.  The instrument is shown in Figure <a href="a16psrf8-1.jpg" title="image" target="new">8-1</a> in the Preliminary Science
Report and consists of a reference plate which Charlie presses on the
ground and then pushes a rod through the plate into the soil.  The rod can
be fitted with cone-shaped tips of various sizes and, as he pushes, the
force he has to use is recorded on a drum.  Charlie's next transmission
suggests that he was supposed to make measurements on one of benches seen
in pre-mission overhead photos of Stone Mountain and then on the slopes on
either side of the bench.]</i></blockquote>

that sound?<p>

<b><a name="1442557">144:25:57</a></b> Young: I'm looking at a rock here,

looks like it may have pulled up some local material.

<blockquote><i>[Pre-mission thinking about the 
<a href="a16.lsp009.jpg" title="image" target="new">Apollo 16 site</a> suggested
that the Stone Mountain bedrock was different from the rock underlying the
Cayley Plains.  As mentioned previously, there were expectations that John
and Charlie would find volcanic rocks on the mountain and what Houston is
looking for, here, is a fresh crater large enough to have dug down into
that bedrock.  Although it was not known beforehand whether or not there
would be significant amounts of South Ray ejecta on the mountain side, John
and Charlie have been unequivocal in their statements that there are,
indeed, many pieces of South Ray ejecta present.]<p>

pulled it out, and it came out like it was supposed to.  And then I started
moving the thing down and it fell off.  (Pause)  (I don't know) what to do
about that.  (Long Pause)

<b>144:28:16</b> Duke: (Handing a set of tongs to John)  Okay, here you go.

it for me, I think I can.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets the other set of tongs off the back of the
Rover.  The area where he dropped the penetrometer cone is hidden from view
by the Rover, but we can see that he uses the tongs to get the cone and
then raises the tongs high enough that John can grab the cone.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;This is the first time that either of you has used the
tongs.  Did your start to use them here because of the slope or the number
of rocks?  You'll use them pretty regularly from now on.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I guess it was just time (to start using them).  And I
dropped that penetrometer head on to the ground and tongs were perfect to
pick that up; so we broke those out.  And John was over sampling by himself
and so he decided he needed a set.  So we started using them at this
point.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:30:05</b> Duke: Tony, you just can't believe that South Ray Crater.  It is perfectly (looking for the right word) cylindrical - circular.  And it's amazing.  It's just really apparent that we got two types of rocks there.

<blockquote><i>[As shown in Figure 18 from

his left hand and is having no trouble putting the rocks in with the
scoop.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:31:45</b> Duke: And if you want my opinion on the thing, I don't
think we're hitting hard ground.  I think what I did is probably hit a
rock, and I should have probably moved this thing over a little bit.<p>

John used to tongs to tip a hand-sized rock upright so he could get the
tongs around a narrow dimension of the rock.  He then raised it without
difficulty.]<p>

<b>144:32:39</b> Duke: Okay.  You know, John, with all these rocks here,
I'm not sure we're getting Descartes.<p>

<b>144:32:47</b> Young: That's right.  I'm not either.<p>

<b>144:32:48</b> Duke: We ought to go down to a crater without any rocks. 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is suggesting that craters with significant numbers
of surface rocks on this part of 
<a href="a16.site-s.jpg" title="image" target="new">Stone Mountain</a> have been dug by South Ray
ejecta and that they want to find a crater without rocks in hope that the
South Ray contamination will be less.]<p>

[During the mission review, Charlie commented on the fact that the Apollo
crews visited only six sites of the Moon and that none of the crews had
time to do a definitive of even those small areas.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Trying to figure out the Moon with what we're doing in Apollo
is like having one drop of water to study out of the whole Pacific Ocean,
really.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Just a few clues and hints to the general picture.&quot;]<p>

[Charlie turns his back to the Rover and, as Fendell gets him centered, he
pushes the penetrometer into the ground with his left hand.  Gradually, he
sinks to his knees and then bounds forward to regain his balance.  Only the
recording drum is above the surface.]</i></blockquote>

watching.<p>

<b>144:33:01</b> Duke: Okay, the two-tenths...(Stops to listen)  The
two-tenths...You see that?  The 0.2 went all the way in.<p>

<b>144:33:07</b> England: We understand.  Can you tell how far it stroked
up on the pressure?  Do you think it reached the hilt?<p>

<b>144:33:16</b> Duke: No, it was very light pressure, frankly.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie bobs down onto his right knee, holds his position
long enough to get the recording drum with his right hand, and pulls the
penetrometer out of the ground as he rises and runs
forward.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:33:22</b> Duke: Maybe it just depends on whether you hit a rock down
there or not.  This is really loosely consolidated.  This regolith. 
Loosely packed.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie pulls the reference plate down to the end of the
rod.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:33:36</b> England: Okay.  Was that (recording drum) index on 6?<p>

<b>144:33:41</b> Duke: That's affirm.  Going to 7.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie adjusts the recording drum.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:33:48</b> Young: You don't mind if I put those bags in your seat, do
you, Charlie?<p>

<b>144:33:51</b> Duke: Not a bit.

<b>144:34:02</b> England: Okay, we're coming around.  (Pause)<p>

<b>144:34:12</b> Duke: This seems a little more firmly packed here. <p>

<b>144:34:15</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<b>144:34:26</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>144:34:28</b> Duke: Oh, it's up above the red mark.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie pulls the penetrometer out of the ground and shakes
some dust off.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:34:34</b> Duke: And it got progressively harder (to push the
penetrometer in).  So I think that was a good reading.  I don't think that
was necessarily a rock down there.<p>

<b>144:34:42</b> England: Good show.  We finally guessed right (on where to
do the measurement).

<blockquote><i>[Charlie resets the reference plate and the recording drum
and moves off-camera to the right.  Fendell follows.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:34:49</b> Duke: Okay.  Going to (recording drum position) 8 and I'm
going downslope.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>144:35:02</b> Duke: John, this crater over here looks like it might be -
just downslope here - looks like it might be one of the Cincos, and it could
be Descartes material, because it's just some little blocks around it.  And
there's some little blocks inside the rim, too.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The size of ejecta fragments are largest near the rim of a
crater and become smaller with distance.  The blocks at this site which
seem to be South Ray ejecta are of a certain size and Charlie is
speculating that a crater showing only blocks of a noticeably smaller size
might not be contaminated.]<p>

[As mentioned following <a href="a16.trvsta4.html#1440729" target="new">144:07:29</a>, they are about 80 meters west of 
<a href="a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">Cinco 'a'</a>.]<p>

[As Charlie moves below the Rover, he angles across slope toward the
northwest.  Fendell is only able to keep Charlie's PLSS in view.  He stops
and Fendell is able to get him centered.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:35:24</b> Duke: Okay.  Here we go.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is facing up slope, with the penetrometer slightly
above him.  He leans forward and presses on the recording drum and, after
encountering some resistance, he gets it in a few inches before it stops. 
He presses on the drum two more times, getting about half the rod into the
ground in the process.  He then gives a final push and the rod sinks all
the way into the ground.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1443531">144:35:31</a></b> Young: Okay, Houston.  I'm digging an exploratory trench right here to see if the material is black.<p>

<b>144:35:41</b> England: Okay.  We copy that, John.<p>

<b>144:35:43</b> Young: No, it's sure not.  I mean 'the material is not white'.  It's just the same as it...

<blockquote><i>[John is thinking that, as with the white soil they <a href="a16.sta1.html#1235059" target="new">uncovered with their boots</a> on the rim of Plum Crater, shocked/shattered soil may have been throw up onto Stone Mountain by the South Ray impact. By digging a trench, he might reveal a white layer or, at least, signs of layering underneath the surface layer.]<p>

[As the penetrometer sinks into the ground on Charlie's final push,  he ends up balanced on his toes and his left hand, which is resting on the top of the drum.  He tries to run uphill to get his feet under him but, after vigorously treading regolith for a few seconds, he gives up and falls forward onto his hands.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:35:51</b> Duke: Aghh, rats!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie pushes himself back and, once his torso is over his knees, he rises without difficulty.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:35:56</b> Duke: (To Tony) How'd you like that?<p>

<b>144:35:57</b> England: Beautiful maneuver there, Charlie.  What do you do for an encore?<p>

<b>144:36:10</b> England: Okay.  We saw that.

<blockquote><i>[While facing upslope, Charlie bobs down to his right knee and retrieves the penetrometer.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:36:12</b> Duke: But it went all the way in.  I mean the force.<p>

<b>144:36:19</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  I've gone down about (pause) a shovel width, and it's all the same material.  And I don't see any layering in it or anything.<p>

[Charlie moves upslope toward the back of the Rover and uses a slow, hopping sidestep.  He advances the recording drum and then taps the penetrometer several times to loosen the dust he kicked onto it.  Fendell follows.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I wasn't sinking in too far.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;No.  The toe on the uphill side isn't penetrating not more than an inch and a half.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:36:50</b> Duke: Okay.  I've sequenced to number 9, and I'm stowing this beauty.<p>

<b>144:36:56</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>144:37:01</b> Duke: And that one test, downhill, was on the steepest
part.<p>

<b>144:37:06</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[As Charlie pushes the penetrometer into its stowage slot at
the back of the Rover, we see the whole vehicle move and, in particular,
get a demonstration that the right rear wheel - the one behind the LMP seat
- is off the ground.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:37:09</b> Duke: Tony, when I push that beauty (meaning the
penetrometer) in there, it almost turns the Rover over.  (Pause)  Tony, do
you want this double core in the bench here or downslope where I think is
probably closer to (being) Descartes?<p>

<b>144:37:43</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  I've got a sample out of the
deepest part of this trench that I'm digging, and it's going into

[Charlie takes the rake off of the extension handle and puts the rake down on the back of the Rover.  He will attach the extension handle to the upper core tube so he can drive the double core into the ground without leaning over too far.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:38:13</b> Duke: Did you copy that, Tony?  My question?<p>

<b>144:38:16</b> England: Right, Charlie.  Why don't we just go ahead and
take it downslope there about your last penetrometer place?<p>

<b>144:38:24</b> Duke: Okay, will do.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes off-camera to the right to join John.  Fendell
follows but reaches the clockwise pan limit before he finds
them.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:38:31</b> Duke: Okay, John, I'm going to come over there...<p>

<b>144:38:34</b> Young: What do you need, Charlie?<p>

<b><a name="1443839">144:38:39</a></b> Young: Okay.  I'm going to leave those two cores in that
(extra) bag.  It makes it stand up.

<blockquote><i>[John is referring to the extra SCB he got from under the

<b>144:42:04</b> England: Okay, John.  That might be a good place to get a
rock.  We're really looking for one (meaning a crater) where the rock
around the crater should come from the crater;  not from the secondary.

<blockquote><i>[Houston is looking for Stone Mountain bedrock and not South

<b>144:42:39</b> Young: I think you really need a primary impact crater to avoid the problem.<p>

<b>144:42:47</b> England: Yeah.  You're right, John.

<blockquote><i>[A primary impact is one by a high-velocity projectile coming in from elsewhere in the solar system.  A typical impact velocity would be 20 to 30 km/s, rather than 1 to 2 km/sec in the case of a secondary impact.  In a primary impact, the projectile is usually vaporized and, if the crater is large enough, blocks on the rim are likely to have been dug up out of the bedrock.

The only...the only rock I see on the south rim of this obvious secondary is (pause) not too big.  I can get down into the crater and look down in it, and see if I can scratch away to a bench, if you'd like to do that.

<blockquote><i>[John is suggesting that he climb down into the crater and
scrape soil off part of the wall to try to find bedrock.  If the crater
depth is greater than the regolith depth, there would be a bench partway
down the inner wall that would mark the regolith/bedrock boundary.]<p>

Rover, takes his camera off so he can put it on the LMP
seat.]</i></blockquote>

You know where we landed?  Charlie/Alpha 81!  (That is, CA.0/81.0.)<p>

<b>144:50:11</b> Duke: What?<p>

<b>144:50:12</b> Young: Charlie/Alpha 81.  We're about 200 meters north of
Double Spot.

<blockquote><i>[As can be seen in the 
<a href="a16.lsp267.jpg" title="image" target="new">traverse map</a>, the planned landing spot was CA.0/81.0.  On the other hand, a
point &quot;200 meters north of Double Spot&quot; would be near CA.6/80.6. 
Pan Camera frame <a href="a16.pan4623clbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">4623</a> shows the actual landing spot
300 meters due north of Double Spot at CB.1/80.6  These
difference are too small to be of operational significance, but it is
interesting - and not surprising - that John knows the craters around the planned landing site well enough to make this determination from a distance of 4 kilometers and an elevation angle of only 1.9 degrees and without reference to a map.  The one thing that makes the identification possible is the fact that the surface near the LM slopes down to the south, dropping 50 meters in about 700 meters on a north-south line through the LM.  This increases John's apparent viewing angle from 1.9 degrees to about 6 degrees.  All of the Apollo commanders who intended to land at specific spots - this excludes only Armstrong - showed great professional interest in figuring out exactly where they landed.]</i></blockquote>

definitely Descartes.  Right down here.  Okay...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie wants to rake where he is, below the rim on the
outer slope.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:51:05</b> Young: The object is to get the stuff that's been knocked out of the ground and landed on the rim.

[Duke - &quot;It was real steep.  I mean, it was real tough walking up
there.  And right over that (rim), there's this crater on the other side that's real deep.  That's what we keep talking about; 'Don't fall in there.'

<b>144:55:54</b> Duke: You know, John, that black stuff is glass - on those rocks.<p>

<b>144:55:57</b> Young: Sure it is.  That's what I said. <p>

<b>144:55:59</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>144:56:04</b> England: Okay, fellows, we'd like to get you packed up there.  We'll save the padded bags for later.<p>

<b>144:56:11</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>144:56:15</b> England: And your (heading) gyro is good.  We won't need to torque it.<p>

<b>144:56:17</b> Duke: I think we have enough rocks from the South Ray.<p>

<b>144:56:23</b> Young: (Responding to Tony)  Okay.

<b>144:56:36</b> Young: Okay.  I'll go ahead and pack up, Charlie. <p>

<b>144:56:38</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie plants the scoop, pushing it several times to make sure it is secure, and then hangs the extra SCB from the handle before starting the pan.  This action suggests that a standard part of the geology tool kit ought to be a stake with a hook at the top so that the stake could be planted at a sampling site with a bag hanging in easy reach.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1445649">144:56:49</a></b> Duke: Okay, let's see; how do I do this?  f/11 at 74.  Hmmm.  Click. (Pause)  Click, click, click.  Okay, Tony.  Do you want me to change the mags on the 16(-mm camera)?  It's about empty.  That...<p>

<b>144:57:15</b> England: That's affirmative.<p>

<b>144:57:44</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  Doing this pan, I've moved about 2 feet downslope, so I don't know that things are going to match up too well or not.<p>

<b>144:57:51</b> England: Ah, we'll make it work.<p>

<b>144:57:55</b> Duke: (Finishing the pan)  Okay.  And, after that pan, I'll be leaving here with frame count 110.<p>

<b>144:58:02</b> England: Okay, Charlie; 110.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The complete <a href="a16pan1445649.jpg" title="image" target="new">Station 4 pan</a> has been assembled by Dave Byrne.  By starting the assembly with the down-Sun frame and ending with another, the effects of Charlie's change in position while taking the pan are minimized.]<p>

[Charlie pulls the scoop out of the ground and gets the SCB
off the handle.  However, in the process of transferring the SCB to his right hand, he drops it.  Fortunately, none of the sample bags fall out.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:58:12</b> Duke: (Talking to the SCB) You dog, you!<p>

<b>144:58:14</b> Young: What are you talking about?  Did you drop it, Charlie?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie moves downslope of the bag so he can grab it without having to get to his knees.  This is a graphic illustration of the steep slope.]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:58:15</b> Duke: Yeah, but I got it.  Get downslope here, and it's a piece of cake.<p>

<b>144:58:20</b> Young: Yeah, it is.

hillside.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That was tough.  That was a tough stop.  But, I mean, you just do it.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;There's a great deal of inventiveness here in getting things done.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Well, you know, it's simple physics, really. 'I'd
better get downslope for this one.'  Those kind of
things.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>144:59:05</b> Duke: Okay.  I'm at 70 percent, clear flags, 3.85, and I got just out of Medium - correction just out of Min.  I got it, John.<p>

<b><a name="1445923">144:59:23</a></b> Young: (To Houston)  Okay.  I think the flact [sic] that we didn't run across any white soil may be significant around here. (Pause)<p>

<b>144:59:45</b> England: Okay.  Y'all look very good.<p>

<b>144:59:53</b> Duke: Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  And as we leave Cinco Crater, we bid a fond farewell.<p>

<b>145:00:06</b> England: Okay; and, John, we'll need a frame count from
you.<p>

<b>145:00:08</b> Duke: Okay, Tony...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>145:00:13</b> Young: Okay.  My frame count is 76, magazine Charlie.<p>

<b>145:00:19</b> Duke: John, could you give me (16-mm) magazine Romeo? <p>

<b>145:00:22</b> Young: Yep.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell is panning slowly north along the South Ray ejecta
blanket, stopping every half frame width so that people in the Backroom can
take pictures of the video monitor.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:00:24</b> Duke: Hey, Tony.  I think on this next one we ought to
stop away from any boulders down at 5, so we can get some 
<a href="a16.lsp014.jpg" title="image" target="new">Descartes</a>.<p>

<b>145:00:40</b> England: Right, we're...<p>

<b>145:00:41</b> Young: Is that where you got Romeo from, Charlie?<p>

<b>145:00:42</b> Duke: Yeah.  That's fine.<p>

<b>145:00:43</b> England: We agree that <a href="a16.lsp241.jpg" title="image" target="new">Station 5</a>'s a key station now.  We
have a pad vector to get you to the crater that you called out on the way
up (at <a href="a16.trvsta4.html#1435859" target="new">143:58:59</a>), but it's up to you on what you think is the best place to be sure of
getting Descartes.<p>

<b>145:01:00</b> Young: We got ya (meaning he understands).<p>

<b>145:01:03</b> Duke: Okay.  We could move 40 feet...(correcting himself) 
50 meters downslope, and I think we'd have Descartes, but we'll look. 
Okay.  Ready, John?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell is now looking at 
<a href="a16.pan4623slbl.jpg" title="image" target="new">Baby Ray Crater</a>, still at maximum

<b>145:01:17</b> Duke: (Scanning 
<a href="a16eva2LMP-09.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-9</a>)  Okay; I've got the frame count. 
DAC's mag's R.  Padded bags we're skipping.  Okay; DAC, f/8, 250.  Got to change that.<p>

<b>145:01:29</b> Young: Okay, going (<a href="../alsj-LCRU.html" target="new">LCRU</a>) Mode switch to 1 (PM1/NB), Houston; and
the TV CCW (counter-clockwise).

<blockquote><i>[TV off.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:01:35</b> England: Okay.  That 50 meters downslope you described, is
that a blocky rim crater, or why do you think that is Descartes?<p>

<b>145:01:44</b> Duke: Because there's no blocks around it at all.<p>

<b>145:01:48</b> Young: It's just an old subdued crater.<p>

<b><a name="1450151">145:01:51</a></b> Duke: It's got a few blocks around it.  (Pause)  Tony, I
can see that one downslope that you want us to stop at for Station 5.  It
won't be any trouble getting there, but if you give us a vector, that'll be
certain.

<blockquote><i>[As Charlie mentioned at <a href="a16.trvsta4.html#1435859" target="new">143:58:59</a> as they passed the crater on the way to Station 4, the crater was at a bearing and range of 354/3.4.  Station 4 is at a bearing and range of 354/4.1.]</i></blockquote>

<b>145:02:09</b> England: Okay.  The vector will be 352 (should be 354) heading and seven
tenths (kilometer drive)<p>

<b>145:02:11</b> Duke: John, look in the (garbled) there.  Do you
see...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>145:02:20</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>145:02:22</b> England: Does that look like the best bet to you?  (Pause)
What we're looking for...<p>

<b>145:02:28</b> Duke: That seems to be about it...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>145:02:29</b> England: ...is a primary impact...(Stops to listen)<p>
<p>

<b>145:02:30</b> Young: Charlie.  (Pause)  (To Houston)  Say again.<p>

<b>145:02:42</b> Duke: What they're looking for is a primary impact crater
in Descartes.<p>

<b>145:02:43</b> England: What we're looking for is a primary impact at
blocky rim crater.<p>

<b>145:02:49</b> Young: Understand.<p>

<b>145:02:52</b> Duke: Suppose we give you a primary impact with no block? 
(Pause)  Wait a minute, John.  I can't find this seatbelt.  There we go.<p>

<b>145:03:10</b> England: And we don't want one without blocks.  It'll
almost have to be blocky.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is afraid that any blocky-rimmed crater will be
showing South Ray blocks whereas the Backroom is hoping that John and
Charlie will be able to find a blocky-rimmed crater that has brought up
Stone Mountain bedrock (the Descartes formation), much like Spur Crater
brought up bedrock on the flank of Mt. Hadley Delta at the Apollo 15
site.]</i></blockquote>
