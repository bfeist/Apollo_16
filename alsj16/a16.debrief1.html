<b>128:12:31</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  We're ready for the 'EVA debriefing with Houston' (which is listed on Surface 3-5), and lift-off time...I guess we can take that, too, if we can find the Data Book.<p>

<b>128:12:41</b> England: Okay, fine.  Why don't we just give you all the
housekeeping right now?  (Pause)  Charlie, when you're ready...<p>

<b>128:12:49</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>128:12:50</b> England: ...we can give you the battery management (on Surface 3-3 that Houston asked the crew to delay at <a href="a16.eva1post.html#1270043" target="new">127:00:43</a>).<p>

<b>128:12:59</b> Young: Okay, go ahead with that.  Charlie's all ears.<p>

<b>128:13:02</b> England: Okay.  If you'll read us the ED voltages.<p>

<b>128:13:13</b> Duke: It's amazing, but they're still 37 volts.<p>

<b>128:13:16</b> England: Well, that's encouraging.  Okay, we'd like the Lunar Battery to the CDR's Bus.  Battery 3 and 4, Off.  Batteries 1 and 2, On.<p>

<b>128:13:28</b> Duke: Okay.  I won't do it in that sequence, but I know
what you want.<p>

<b>128:13:34</b> England: Okay, fine.  Okay, the battery management on (Surface) 3-3 will get you there.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;I gather that there was a (specific) sequence to go through to make sure there was still power in things as you were switching batteries?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;There must have been something like that that they
wanted me to do.  If you turn batteries 3 and 4 off before you turn
batteries 1 and 2 on, you were going to be without any power.  Anyway, I followed the procedure because I knew I didn't want to drop power.  So that was a concern.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[NASA Public Affairs announces the start of a change-of-shift press briefing.  The first two lines of the next exchange between Charlie and Tony were not captured on the PAO tape.]<p>

[Readers should note that the times used at this point in the Journal differ from the GET being used in Houston because of an 11 minute 48 second update made to the clocks in Houston at

<b>128:13:58</b> Duke: Okay, you got it.  Batts 1 and 2 are On.  Batts 3 and 4 are Off.  And the Luny Batt is Commander.<p>

<b>128:14:06</b> England: Good show.  And looks good here.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie then read the procedures on Surface 3-3 and looked at the Descent Electrical Power drawing, DES (Descent Electrical System) 2, in the Apollo 16 &amp; 17 LM Systems Data Book.  I looked for the switches in Figure 3-2 in the LM Operations Handbook.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;There was a battery 1 and 2, and then there was a
battery 3 and 4; and the 1 and 2 batteries were on the LMP's bus and the 3 and 4 were the Commander's batteries.  Then the Lunar Battery you could put on either bus.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I haven't found the switch yet.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It's on panel 14 (on Charlie's side of the cabin).
(Pause)  It has Descent Power/Lunar Batt (at the middle of the
panel)&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Oh, there's 14.  I've got it.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You had a Commander's position or you had an LMP's
position.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:14:15</b> England: And do you want this block data?<p>

<b>128:14:20</b> Young: Ready to copy.<p>

<b>128:14:22</b> England: Okay.  It's LM lift-off, LM Timeline Book.  T-28, plus 21 plus 08.  T-29, 130 plus 19 plus 49.  T-30, 132 plus 18 plus 22.  131 (sic), 134 plus 16 plus 54;  T-32, 136 plus 15 plus 27.  T-33, 138 plus 15 plus 20.  And that's it.<p>

<b>128:15:21</b> Young: Okay.  Give me 31 again, Tony.<p>

<b>128:15:24</b> England: Okay, T-31, 134 plus 16 plus 54.<p>

<b>128:15:35</b> Young: Okay.  Starting with T-29, 130 plus 19 plus 49; 132 plus 18 plus 22;  134 plus 16 plus 54;  136 plus 15 plus 27; 138 plus 15 plus 20, (and those are the times) through (T-)33.<p>

<b>128:15:58</b> England: Okay, readback's good.  And, we have some changes to your Surface Checklist.  (Pause)  (Page) 3-5.  (Pause)<p>

<b>128:16:14</b> Young: Roger.  What page did you say, again? <p>

<b>128:16:17</b> England: 3-5.<p>

<b>128:16:21</b> Young: Roger.  (Pause)<p>

<b>128:16:25</b> England: Okay...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>128:16:26</b> Duke: You speak.<p>

<b><a name="1281627">128:16:27</a></b> England: All right.  We're going back to a nominal post-EVA-1, Pre-EVA-2.  So, on the EVA debriefing with Houston, that's at 128:20.  And cancel the crossouts that we've put in there.  Eat period's at 128 plus 35. And go ahead and do the part at the bottom of the page that you've redlined out there, the 112 plus 10.  Do that part.<p>

<b>128:17:08</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>128:17:09</b> England: Okay.  At the top of the second column there, the PLSS O2 and H2O recharge is 129 plus 20; go ahead and do that.  And the rest of the page, go ahead and do.<p>

<b>128:17:25</b> Duke: Okay!<p>

<b>128:17:27</b> England: Okay.  On the next page, 3-6, the Pre-sleep is at 129 plus 50.  (Pause)<p>

<b>128:17:41</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>128:17:42</b> England: And the rest period begins at 130 plus 15. 
That's the bottom line, second column.<p>

<b>128:17:53</b> Duke: Okay; 130:15.  Do you want us to bring up the
computer (as per the middle of the left-hand column on 3-6)?  Over.<p>

<b>128:18:00</b> England: Negative.<p>

<b>128:18:03</b> Duke: Okay, we'll still skip that.<p>

<b>128:18:05</b> England: Rog.  And it'll be an 8-hour sleep period, and I
don't have the morning's checklist yet.  I'm trying to get that for you
tonight so we won't have any updates in the morning.  Get your cue...We'll
get your cue card, too, tonight.<p>

<b>128:18:21</b> Young: That'll be kind of you, Tony.<p>

<b>128:18:24</b> England: Okay, now I just have some questions...<p>

<b>128:18:27</b> Duke: That ought to be pretty nominal, Tony.<p>

<b>128:18:28</b> England: Yeah, we're looking right now at a completely
nominal...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>128:18:30</b> Duke: Hey, let me ask you...(Stops to listen)<p>

<a name="1281833"></a><b>128:18:33</b> England: (Continuing the interrupted thought) completely nominal EVA-2, and the day will probably be 2 hours longer (than planned), so you have...It's kind of a relaxed day.  We'll have some time to sit around and talk in the evening.  And we're still looking beyond there, but things look pretty good.  And your biomed looks great down here.  Just keep up the orange juice.  (Perhaps) push on it a little bit there and everything will be fine.<p>

<b>128:18:58</b> Young: (Amused) Push on the orange juice and everything will be fine?<p>

<b>128:19:02</b> England: Yeah, push on the orange juice.  Rog.<p>

<b>128:19:04</b> Young: I'm going to turn into a citrus product is what I'm gonna do.<p>

<b>128:19:09</b> England: Oh, well; it's good for you, John.

<blockquote><i>[The Apollo 15 crew experienced heart beat irregularities which, post-flight, were determined to have been caused by a potassium deficiency.  In an effort to eliminate the problem, the Apollo 16 crew was given large quantities of potassium-fortified fruit drinks.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>128:19:15</b> Young: Ever hear of acid stomach, Tony?<p>

<b>128:19:17</b> England: Well, I don't know about that.  Also, since tomorrow's pretty relaxed, we encourage you to get a lot of sleep tonight.  You've got plenty of time; no need to feel like you've got to press in the morning.<p>

<b>128:19:30</b> Young: Okay, and I think I've got a pH factor going for about 3 right now.<p>

<b>128:19:36</b> England: (Chuckles)  Okay <p>

<b>128:19:38</b> Duke: Okay...<p>

<b>128:19:39</b> England: We'll give you a buffer (meaning an antacid tablet) when you get down.<p>

<b>128:19:41</b> Duke: Okay, Tony...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>128:19:42</b> Young: Because of the orange juice.  (Hearing Tony's
promise of an antacid tablet after the mission)  Yeah.<p>

<b>128:19:44</b> Duke: I'd like to ask a couple of questions about
consumable status, (about) how we look for EVA-3, and what kind of day
EVA-3 would be.  Preliminary plans.  Over.  (Pause)<p>

<b>128:20:06</b> England: Okay.  We've got a whole general plan here.  And I'd like to send that up to you later, if that's okay.<p>

<b>128:20:16</b> Young: That's fine.  And I'd like to get some information on what we did today, in terms of how the PLSS worked, and how our metabolic rates were, and how...That sort of thing.<p>

<b>128:20:31</b> England: Okay, understand.  We'll get them to work on
that.  And whenever you're ready, I can start sending up these questions
from...<p>

<b>128:20:42</b> Duke: Then let's have your debriefing.<p>

<b>128:20:44</b> England: Yeah, right...(Finishing the interrupted thought) from the back room.<p>

<b>128:20:51</b> Young: We're ready as we'll ever be.<p>

<b>128:20:53</b> England: Okay.  There was one here, just use of words that we had a question on.  When you armed the mortar package, you described all three pins are pulled.  I read that to mean that you'd pulled the horse collar there and armed the two switches.  Is that right?<p>

<b>128:21:11</b> Young: That is affirmative.<p>

<b>128:21:14</b> England: Okay, now on to the geology.<p>

<b>128:21:16</b> Young: She (meaning the mortar package)'s all ready to go.<p>

<b><a name="1282118">128:21:18</a></b> England: Good show.  Okay, when Charlie was working around the LM there 
(at <a href="a16.lrvdep.html#1191736" target="new">119:17:36</a>), he described a black vesicular basalt underneath the engine.  Was that the only basalt you saw on all of EVA-1?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Basalts are fine-grained rocks formed from molten lava on the surface and, hence at low pressure.  The fine-grained texture is a
product of rapid cooling.  Virtually no pieces of basalt - other than small, incidental fragments in the regolith - were collected at the Apollo 16 site.]<p>

[Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter - &quot;We weren't expecting to find
basalt at this landing site.  The light color of the region precluded the
presence of dark (basaltic) rocks such as those we landed on in Apollo
missions 11, 12, and 15.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:21:40</b> Duke: That's all I saw.  There are some more blocks than that scattered, I think, around the landing area, Tony.<p>

<b>128:21:51</b> Young: Yeah, and, Tony, Charlie's idea to make this area LM 10...I mean, to make this (area around the LM) Stop 10 is a pretty good one.  There's plenty to get around here.<p>

<b>128:21:59</b> England: Okay, we understand.  You said that the rocks in this area look different from what you saw (at Stations 1 and 2).  About how far west did that difference go?<p>

<b>128:22:11</b> Young: There you go.  I was just...At zero phase, I just
hang on to the Rover and try to see where the next hole is.<p>

<b>128:22:21</b> England: That's called passing the buck.<p>

<b>128:22:22</b> Duke: Well, let me say, Tony, that the...(Stops to
listen)<p>

<b>128:22:25</b> Young: (A bit defensive) That's not passing the buck,
Tony.  There's no way you can look down there when you're driving and see
any...You can't even see the craters, much less the (lost under Tony)<p>

<b>128:22:34</b> England: We understand, John, the point you make.<p>

<b>128:22:36</b> Young: ...what kind of rock's they are.  (Hears Tony's
apology)  Okay.<p>

<b>128:22:41</b> Duke: Well, let me give it a try, Tony.  I always have an
opinion.  The rocks around the...beyond the ALSEP on our drive out past
Spook and Buster, all had this breccia appearance to them, with the
primarily grayish matrix with a dark clast.  At Buster, though, there were
some rocks that were very shocked, I think.  In fact, they just crumbled in
my hand - the one I picked up.  So, at least at Buster and Spook, the rocks
appear to be different, in the main, than they are right here.  Over.<p>

<b>128:23:32</b> England: Okay, we copy that.  Of the rocks you saw, do you feel like you sampled all the representative types?<p>

<b>128:23:45</b> Duke: Well, out there at Flag, they were all so dust covered, I don't know.  I was really surprised when John broke that big boulder open and saw that whitish matrix with the clasts.  I frankly don't think that was a breccia, but it was a pretty friable rock, anyway.<p>

<b>128:24:07</b> England: Okay, we copy that.  You first described the Muley rock as a crystalline and then switched to a...Correction.  You first described it as a breccia, then switched to crystalline.  I wonder if you could have some third or fourth thoughts on that?  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1282434">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1282434.mp3" target="new">11 min 27 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>128:24:34</b> Duke: Well, I'd say when I picked it up, it was pretty dust covered, and only had a couple of spots that I could look.  One (dust-free) area looked like a crystalline rock.  There was a...If it were a breccia, then that clast is pretty large, a centimeter or so.  If it's a crystalline rock, then it's a sort of a feldspar-looking type crystal.  The other (dust-free spots on the rock)...When I turned it over, it had another one of those white specks that most of the breccias have around here, and that's when I switched.  So it could be a combination, Tony.

<blockquote><i>[Because of the dust coating, Charlie is being appropriately cautious in his description of Big Muley ( <a href="ap16-S72-41550.jpg" target="new">175k</a> ).]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you spend any time with the geologists and the
samples after you got back?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  And that's a mistake.  We didn't.  We went over to the Lunar Receiving Lab (LRL) to look at them as they unboxed them.  We touched a few of them - a day or so we spent, I guess.  But then we started going on those PR trips and then we went right back into training (as the Apollo 17 backup crew).  So we didn't do that, and that was a mistake.  I never figured out what Muley was.&quot;]<p>

[In the 1981 compendium, &quot;Geology of the Apollo 16 Area, Central Lunar Highlands&quot;, which is U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1048, edited by G.E. Ulrich, C.A. Hodges, and W.R. Muehlberger, Big Muley ( <a href="ap16-S72-41550.jpg" target="new">175k</a> ) is described as a dark-matrix breccia with light-colored clasts.]<p>

<b>128:25:21</b> England: Okay.  We copy that.  (Long Pause)  Okay.  Can you give us a numerical estimate on the proportion of the rock types in the LM area?  We wonder if there's any correlation between rock type, size, shape, or angularity.  (Long Pause)<p>

<blockquote><i>[Muehlberger, from a 1997 e-mail message - &quot;Clearly, the questions were to confirm whether volcanic rocks or impact breccias were the common rocks; and whether the area was covered with material from South Ray Crater.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:25:53</b> Young: Well, there probably really isn't a correlation like that.  I was just looking out the window here.  I see some very angular rocks that are white rocks.  And some more grayish rocks - in other words, less white in them - that are sort of subrounded (pause)...<p>

<b>128:26:38</b> England: Okay.  Does that correlate with sizes?<p>

<b>128:26:39</b> Young: ...and some rocks that are...(Responding to Tony)  No, these are all about the same size...No, the big whities are...It's just not going to be that correlatable.  I see some that's sitting out there in the middle of the LM (shadow) area that look like, I swear, (Chuckles) they got some pinks in them.  Pink with black clasts in them, laying across on the way to ALSEP site.  And, seemingly, you can almost say they came from South Ray if you're a betting man.  And these big ones...Those seem to be predominantly the size of, oh say, 20-centimeter rocks, and they're very angular.  The white rocks are also...They're smaller.  They're on the order of 10 to 15 centimeters.  I'm just guessing because we're sitting right here in the middle of this thing, and it's sort of like we can't see the
forest for the trees.  They seem to be a smaller rock, maybe 6 - no - 6 to
12 centimeters, very angular.  And they're probably less than 5 percent of the rock type.  The predominant rock in the area is just an old gray,
subrounded, angular rock.  And I would guess that's a breccia of some type.  And although the surface is very boulder-strewn, as you probably noticed on the television, it looks exactly, at the ALSEP site and here, at the same amount of boulders.  I guess we put the thing (meaning the ALSEP) in the same ray almost, because it (meaning the ALSEP)'s almost on a line from here to South Ray.  I guess what I'm saying is I can see what I believe to be at least three different rock types out here.  The white, the pinkish - and this is from the LM so I'm really not qualified to go into that - the pinkish with the black clast in it, and the subrounded gray rock.<p>

<b>128:29:18</b> England: Okay.  Have we sampled all three of those?<p>

<b>128:29:24</b> Young: No, we haven't done any sampling around the LM or around the ALSEP site!<p>

<b>128:29:31</b> England: Okay.  We copy that.  I understood that;  I just wondered if you had picked up anything that you thought was the pink with the black specks anywhere?<p>

<b>128:29:41</b> Young: I think most of the rocks that I was with Charlie, when he was picking up, except for that one that we beat (meaning hammered) off over there (on the west side of Plum), they're all dust covered predominantly, and I never got a chance to look at them.<p>

<b>128:29:51</b> England: Okay, I understand.  (Pause)  So generally...<p>

<b>128:29:57</b> Duke: Hey, Tony, I'd like to give you a what I...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>128:30:01</b> England: Go ahead, Charlie.<p>

<b>128:30:02</b> Duke: Let me say something, Tony, here.  I'd like to give you what I think are the three major areas that we saw today.  One, here at the LM, I'm convinced is a ray from South Ray.  The rock types being predominantly from there.  Over by Flag, we were out of that ray.  We were in the Cayley, and I sampled on the rim of Buster.  And whatever made Buster...I don't think it was a secondary, because I think the rocks that we picked up there were true shocked rocks.  And I just can't see a secondary doing that.  So the rocks around there, we were definitely out of the ray at Buster and Flag...(Correcting himself) Excuse me.  At Buster and Spook.  At Flag and Plum, we're again into Cayley with hardly any blocks visible.  So you have a Cayley without the blocks fartherest (sic) out.  You have the Cayley with the blocks that, I think, are some of the stuff that was made from Buster on the rim, and then in here towards the LM, we have the South Ray.<p>

<b>128:31:27</b> England: Okay.  That sounds good, Charlie.<p>

<b>128:31:30</b> Young: Yeah, I think Charlie's right about that.<p>

<b>128:31:35</b> England: Okay.  In your summary there, you answered a whole mess of my questions here.  I got to slide down the list and find one you haven't answered.  (Pause)  Okay.  How about that albedo change in the subsurface soil that you talked about?  It seemed like...(Of) course, you saw it first time at Flag and were probably more excited about it there.  Was there any difference in its nature between there and Buster and ALSEP and LM?  (Pause)<p>

<b>128:32:10</b> Duke: No.  Only around the LM, there was just...and (around) the ALSEP...it was just in spots.  At Buster, it...Correction.  At Plum, it seemed to be everywhere and...Everywhere we dug a little scoop.   My predominant impression was that the white albedo was coarser grained than the fine-dust cover on top.<p>

<b>128:32:41</b> England: Okay.  The white is coarser.<p>

<b>128:32:46</b> Duke: That's affirm.  It looks sort of...I'm not going to say ash flow, but it sure looked like it was coarse, white...Let me get a better word.  Let me think about that one for a description.<p>

<b>128:33:04</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[During the second EVA, John and Charlie noted the absence of bright-white soil at Station 4 
(<a href="a16.sta4.html#1445923" target="new">144:59:23</a>), Station 5 
(<a href="a16.sta5.html#1452011" target="new">145:20:11</a> and

<b>128:33:06</b> England: Okay, just a question now for you, John.  When you got to Halfway or what you decided was Halfway, we understand you looped around the south, is that right?<p>

<b>128:33:19</b> Young: That's affirm.<p>

<b>128:33:23</b> England: In any of the craters that you looked into...<p>

<b>128:33:26</b> Young: Yeah, we came up on Plum from...(Stops to
listen)<p>

<b>128:33:28</b> England: Okay.  In any of the craters that you looked
into, was there any evidence of outcrops in the walls?  You mentioned the
one boulder that was sticking out the side of Flag, I think it was.  Was
there any other evidence of...Any bedrock?  Any ledges?

<blockquote><i>[Benches or ledges on the inner walls of craters can be
indicators of the base of the regolith, showing where the strength of the
materials changes as the impactor goes from regolith to
bedrock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:33:47</b> Young: (To Charlie) Did you see any in Buster?  (To Tony)  Charlie didn't see any, and I didn't see any.<p>

<b>128:33:51</b> England: Okay.  No benches in any of these craters at
all...<p>

<b>128:33:53</b> Young: No, these were very subdued...(Stops to listen) 
No, these were rather subdued craters.  They do have rocks sticking out of them, particularly at Buster, and there was a few at Flag.  But the rest of them really didn't.  The deceptive part of the whole business, you know, is you can't really tell by looking at a crater how big it is.  I was almost
willing to buy Halfway for being Flag.<p>

<b>128:34:26</b> England: Okay, we understand.<p>

<b>128:34:27</b> Young: It's a long way from being Flag-Crater size.<p>

<b>128:34:31</b> Duke: Tony, let me try again.  The larger craters, the old subdued ones, were boulder free.  The only hint that I had was this
northeast-southwest boulder distribution in Buster.  And that went sort of up the wall southwest to northeast.  Over.<p>

<b>128:35:10</b> England: Right; understand.  I guess that's why (you) went ahead and called it a secondary.  It probably isn't, since it was oriented with the structure of the area.<p>

<b>128:35:23</b> Duke: Man, that was a big rock that came in there, if that was a secondary.  I'll tell you, that is a <i>big</i> crater.  The walls on it are...Well, the east wall was still in shadow to some degree with
whatever our Sun angle is now;  and we couldn't see in the bottom of Flag
or Spook.  We just couldn't get up close enough to the rim to see into the
bottom.

<blockquote><i>[It is currently about 02:30 hours Greenwich Mean Time (GMT/UTC) on April 22, 1972.  The Sun's elevation is about 27.1 degrees.  Charlie made his examination of Buster starting at about 124:31 - about
22:25 GMT/UTC on April 21 - and, at that time, the Sun's elevation was about
25.1 degrees.  At the lunar equator, the Sun rises about 0.5 degrees per
hour.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Certainly, in orbital pictures, Buster looks nice and
round.  So it was just the distribution of rocks in there that (led to the
supposition that Buster was a secondary)...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  I think that's the reason.  I don't think you can
tell...It seems to me we learned (that), if it was a primary crater, you
wouldn't have any rocks in there.  It hit and it all vaporized.  But there
was plenty of blocks there, so that's why we thought it was secondary. 
And, looking at it from the side, you'd probably say it was maybe oblong;
but when you take a top view of it - from the photographs - it obviously
wasn't.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:35:50</b> England: Okay, from the TV there, a couple of times when you were walking around those rims, I was wishing we had that rescue lanyard.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Apollo 12 and 14 crews carried a 100-foot tether -
which Tony is calling a &quot;rescue lanyard&quot; - which could be used if
one member of a crew got down into a crater and couldn't get out without
help.  However, the early crews discovered that it was easy to decide
whether or not it was safe to venture into a given crater and the tether
was not flown on the J missions.  See, for example, the Apollo 12 dialog
and discussion at Bench Crater at <a href="../a12/a12.head_bench.html#1324345" target="new">132:43:45</a> and following.]

<b>128:36:08</b> Young: We'll have to count on Charlie being able to crawl out of any hole he gets in.<p>

<b>128:36:15</b> England: Okay, we're looking...<p>

<b>128:36:16</b> Duke: When I fell down over there by the ALSEP, I crawled into one to stand up.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie fell at about <a href="a16.thumper.html#1224042" target="new">122:40:42</a>.  Fendell was doing a TV pan at the time, and there is no TV record of Charlie's recovery.]<p>

[The astronauts discovered that, by getting their feet into a small crater, it was easier to rock back to get their center-of-mass far enough back that they could stand.  There is video of Jack Schmitt doing this at Apollo 17 Station 4.]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:36:26</b> England: How was the footing, trying to climb out of those?  The little ones?<p>

<b>128:36:33</b> Duke: It's a piece of cake on those little 10-meter size.

<blockquote><i>[A typical crater ten meters in diameter will be about 2-3 meters  deep.]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:36:37</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)   On this Station 10, we're perhaps considering beefing it up, and letting you do some sampling in that area.  And from what you've been saying now, it sounds like you think that the LM-ALSEP area would be a good place to spend some time.  You think from your experience with the drill there, you could drive the double core all right?  And how does a rake sample in that area look?  (Pause)<p>

<b>128:37:08</b> Young: Yeah, we can get a lot of rocks in a rake sample. (Pause)  Charlie says (based on his experience with the drill) the double core will go.<p>

<b>128:37:18</b> England: We're thinking about maybe moving (Station) 10 a little bit away, to get out of the LM descent (plume) and the peeling paint on the LM and all this kind of stuff.  So from what you've been saying, if that's a ray, it should be okay to move to the south-southwest.<p>

<b>128:37:37</b> Young: What peeling paint on the LM?<p>

<b>128:37:41</b> England: Oh, your ablated paint on the top.<p>

<b>128:37:43</b> Young: Man, that LM looks good from the outside.  She
looks good from the outside.  All that paint's gone away.<p>

<b>128:37:49</b> England: (Laughs)  Okay; understand.<p>

<b>128:37:52</b> Young: There's still a little bit out there.<p>

<b>128:37:56</b> England: Okay, a question here on the cosmic ray
(experiment).  When the red ring came off, did it bring the whole cable
with it?<p>

<b>128:38:10</b> Young: No, it brought about 3 inches with it.<p>

<b>128:38:16</b> England: Okay.  Did you happen to notice if there was a
1-1/2-inch hole visible in the upper, left-hand corner of the upper panel? 
(Pause)<p>

<b>128:38:31</b> Young: A 1-1/2-inch hole visible in the upper, left-hand
corner of the upper panel.

<blockquote><i>[John is repeating the question in hopes that it will
trigger a memory.]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:38:37</b> England: I know.  I wouldn't have noticed; but the
question's here.  I thought you just might have seen it.<p>

<b>128:38:44</b> Young: Well, there was a bunch of squares and different samples in the upper panel, but I guess everybody knows that.  But, you say, we would have made a 1-1/2-inch hole in the whole business?<p>

<b>128:39:00</b> England: No, you wouldn't have made the hole, but it would have shown it.<p>

<b>128:39:01</b> Young: I can look at it tomorrow.  (Listens)  We can find out when we're passing by the Y strut tomorrow.<p>

<b>128:39:09</b> England: Okay.  After you pulled the red ring off, was
there any cable hanging out the bottom of the cosmic ray experiment?  I
mean, was there any of that string left?  What I'm wondering is, did the
string break?<p>

<b>128:39:23</b> Young: Just a minute.  I looked at the top of the panel
(out the CDR window).  It did look like the thing had jammed up in there. 
Some of the Mylar in the top section was crinkled in a funny way, like it
had been pulled down on it.  And that was the only abnormal thing I noticed
about it.<p>

<b>128:39:48</b> England: Could you estimate how far it moved before the thing broke?<p>

<b>128:39:58</b> Young: Yeah.  At least 3 inches.  How far does it have to move?<p>

<b>128:40:07</b> England: As long as you get any movement at all, it should be all right.<p>

<b>128:40:13</b> Young: That's what I figured.  I think it moved some. 
(Pause)  I mean...<p>

<b>128:40:19</b> England: Okay.  That should give them enough information to think about back there.  (Pause)  We're curious about the position of the UV camera.  We saw it on TV, but it was pretty hard to get an exact location.  Could you estimate how many feet down-Sun from the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Z</a> footpad, and I understand it's right next to the edge of the shadow? 
(Pause)<p>

<b>128:40:58</b> Young: Okay.  (Looking out the window) Right now, the
camera is about, I would say, from the center of the Z-footpad - I mean the plus-X footpad - to the center of the bottom of the camera is about 4-1/2 or 5 feet.<p>

<b>128:41:31</b> England: Okay.  Now, that is directly to the camera, or is that in the down-Sun direction?<p>

<b>128:41:38</b> Young: That is in the down-Sun direction.<p>

<b>128:41:41</b> England: Okay.  Understand.<p>

<b>128:41:43</b> Young: In the Y distance, the distance to the camera is
about, oh, maybe 5 feet.  Up from the Z strut out to the camera, it may be 6 feet.  And it looks like to me that the Sun has got to move...(Pause) 
I'm not so sure we're not going to have to move the camera to keep it in
the shade, if the Sun is going to move another 20 or 30 degrees while we're here.

<blockquote><i>[As the sun rises 0.5 degrees per hour, the LM shadow gets shorter and things near the edge of the shadow will be sunlit relatively soon.  With the Sun currently at an elevation of about 26.5 degrees, the shadow of the 7-meter-tall LM is about 14 meters long and is shortening by about 0.3 m per hour.  When John first deployed the UV camera at about 119:40 - about 17:34 hours GMT on April 21 - the Sun was about 23 degrees above the horizon and the LM shadow was about 17 meters long.  By the end of EVA-3 at 171:11 - about 21:05 hours GMT on April 23 - the Sun will be 48 degrees above the horizon and the LM shadow will only be 6.3 meters long.  Readers should note that, according to the original Flight Plan, EVA-3 was to have ended about 16 hours earlier, when the Sun was at an elevation of 40 degrees.]</i></blockquote>

<b>128:42:28</b> England: Okay.  Understand.  The Sun looks like it's
coming down on the top of it?<p>

<b>128:42:36</b> Young: (With a touch of annoyance in his voice) No, the
Sun is not coming down on top of it.<p>

<b>128:42:40</b> England: No, I didn't mean...<p>

<b>128:42:42</b> Young: The shadow has got to move...(Stops to listen)  The shadow has got to move in, oh, about 12 feet before it gets into the LM (means the UV camera) or...That's hard for me to tell from right here.<p>

<b>128:42:57</b> England: Okay.  I understand, John.<p>

<b>128:42:59</b> Young: But I set it up like that picture in the book
(<a href="a16.lsp045.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-9</a>).<p>

<b>128:43:04</b> England: Rog.  (Pause)  Okay.  One more geology question here.  Was there any difference between the rocks in the bottom of Buster and those on the rim of Buster?<p>

<b>128:43:28</b> Duke: You want me to guess, Tony?  I don't think so.<p>

<b>128:43:32</b> England: Okay, you're right.  (Chuckling) That's all you
can do.<p>

<b>128:43:38</b> Duke: Okay.  And the reason I don't think so is that the rocks in the bottom were all shattered and crumbly looking and sort of mounds of rocks with many fractures in them, which was just like the one I sampled that crumbled up in my hand.  So, texturally, from 50 meters, they look the same.<p>

<b>128:44:04</b> England: Okay, fine.  That's the end.  Do you have any
comments on the geology?<p>

<b>128:44:16</b> Young: We didn't do enough of it.<p>

<b><a name="1284418">128:44:18</a></b> England: (Laughs) I think you did an outstanding job.  The Backroom was elated.  I went back there after the EVA and talked to them, and they were really excited, really pleased with it.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;I get the impression that both of you took to the geology.  Did John like the geology?&quot;]<p>

<b>128:44:32</b> Young: Who's in the Backroom, now?  Is Dale (Jackson) and Lee (Silver) and Bill Muehlberger back there?

<blockquote><i>[The late Dale Jackson was a volcanologist who, according to Tony England, worked with the crew during their field exercises in Hawaii.

<b>128:44:38</b> England: Yeah, I saw Dale and Lee.  I didn't
see...Correction: I saw Dale and Bill; I didn't see Lee.  I think he's on
the planning team (which is currently thinking about EVAs 2 and 3 based on the results of the first EVA).<p>

<b>128:44:47</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[The following is an earlier conversation between Ken
Mattingly and the CSM CapCom, Hank Hartsfield, starting at 126:10:38.]<p>

know whether you heard me a little while ago or not; but EVA-1 was a total
success. They had a 7 hour and 11 minute EVA.<p>

significant to say or...<p>

<b>Hartsfield</b>: I didn't catch all of it; let me ask...<p>

<b>Mattingly</b>: Did they have any surprises in the things they saw of
that they didn't expect?<p>

<b>Hartsfield</b>: I guess the big thing, Ken, was they found all breccia. 
They found only one rock that possibly might be igneous.<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;(With regard to) the

exception of the kind of questions where they ask you  'what rock did you
pick up at what station?'  Nobody can ever remember the answer to that. 
After you've gone through eight stations, all the rocks look the same.  You
can't remember which rock you picked up at which
station.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1284449">128:44:49</a></b> England: Okay, I have your EMU summary.  There were no PGA problems.  Both PLSSs performed nominally, with no major anomalies.  The CDR's average metabolic rate was 850 BTUs an hour.  The LMP's average metabolic rate was 1050 BTUs an hour.  And there's something here on several procedures in work to work around that purge valve pin problem.  I wasn't sure you had a problem.<p>

<b>128:45:35</b> Young: I don't think we've got a problem, either, if I can figure a way to keep (from) pulling it every time I get in and out of the
Rover.  If I can't do that, why, we'll just keep putting it back in.<p>

<b>128:45:49</b> England: Okay.  We'll investigate it tonight; and we'll
make a recommendation, if necessary, during the EVA prep tomorrow.<p>

<b>128:45:59</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>128:46:00</b> England: Maybe we'll put a lanyard on the pin or
something.<p>

<b>128:46:04</b> Young: (Laughs)  Oh, Tony, now.<p>

<a name="1284606"></a><b>128:46:06</b> England: I'm just reading it. 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;On three or four different occasions on the first EVA, we pulled the purge valve off - either fastening or unfastening the seatbelt pulled the purge valve pin
out.  I didn't know how it was happening.  Charlie never saw how it was
happening.  We never experienced it before.  What we did on the second EVA (Prep at <a href="a16.eva2prep.html#1421255" target="new">142:12:55</a>) was to turn the purge valve around so that the plug came out this side.  I found during the (EVA-2) suit integrity check, when we pressurized the suit prior to egress, I could pull it that way.  So I said, 'Let's do that and get it out of the way', and that's probably the best way to take care of that problem in real time.  The ground was going to suggest that we tie the purge valve with a piece of string, and that would have just been something else to pull loose and get in the way.  We really had too much stuff to do.

So, I think that was an adequate fix, a real-time fix, for that problem. 
The other thing they said about the purge valve, which I really didn't
understand, (was) they wanted to bring mine back for analysis.  We don't
know whose purge valve is whose, so I don't think that was a rational
request - to bring one back as opposed to another one.  But they got them
both back, I think.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Yes.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was just catching
on something.  I don't know what.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I think it was your
seatbelt, John.  It happened when you dismounted.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Yes.  It must have
happened when we dismounted, because we found it lying beside the
Rover.&quot;]<p>

[Mattingly, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;That's surprising.

Those things are hard to pull out, unless you just get them lined up
right.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;He did it three
times.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I did it three times
on EVA-1 and had everybody nervous.  I didn't know what was going
on.&quot;]<p>

[The following is taken from the Apollo 16 Mission Report - &quot;On
three occasions during the first EVA, the pin assembly - red apple - on the
Commander's purge valve was accidentally removed while ingressing or
egressing the Lunar Roving Vehicle.  Each time, the assembly was found and
re-inserted.  During subsequent EVAs, the crew wore their purge valves
rotated from the recommended position to prevent the pin from being pulled
out.  Testing indicates that the Lunar Rover lap-belt buckle could be the
cause of the purge valve pin being accidentally removed.  A modification
has been made to eliminate the barrel actuator spring in the purge valve
and to shorten and stiffen the pin assembly lanyard.  This modification
will require manual pull-out of the purge valve barrel, and will prove less
chance of the red apple and lanyard being snagged.&quot;]<p>

<b>128:46:10</b> England: Okay.  The LMP had depleted both the primary and secondary water tanks, and the CDR had approximately 2 hours remaining.  And the LMP's O2 use rate was higher than expected due to high metabolic rate.  CDR's O2 rate was nominal.<p>

The drive to Station 2 took only two minutes longer than expected - mostly because of the time they took to make sure they were at the right place, and they parked at Station 2 at 5 hours 28 minutes (124:21).  At this point they were about 26 minutes behind schedule.  Station 2 had been planned as a 56-minute stop but, because of the late departure from Station 1, Houston told the crew at the start of the drive from Station 1 that the stop would be cut to 19 minutes.  In reality, John and Charlie spent 27 minutes at Station 2 and left at 5 hours 55 minutes

there today.  We're real happy with it down here.  Tony told you the plan
tomorrow is to run a full 7-hour (EVA).  And our plan beyond that is to
give you a little longer day than usual tomorrow.  And the following day,
run a third EVA for about 5 hours, then go ahead and launch and rendezvous and try to hold you to about an 18-hour day total, which means hang on to the LM and go into a sleep cycle (before LM jettison).  So that's kind of the master plan at this point.<p>

whether or not that was luck or skill.  I thought it was being pretty
skillful because I could see all the way to the ground and then we got
out...And I noticed that we were kind of close to a crater, so I went
forward a little.  Then we got out and, shoot, we hadn't landed more than
about 10 feet beyond this big thing.<p>

<b>130:04:32</b> Slayton: That's pure skill and cunning, John.<p>

<b>130:04:34</b> Young: And it...(Stops to listen)  That's right.  I didn't
realize we'd come in so close to it.  I think I was backing up just a hair
before we landed.  Although the probes seem to have broke (sic) straight up and down.<p>

<b>130:04:52</b> Slayton: Rog.  Sounds like you had essentially no
velocity, except vertical.  (Pause)<p>

<b>130:05:06</b> Duke: And, Deke, the landing didn't seem that hard, but we must have stroked the gear.  The (engine) bell is about 10 inches off - less than that - about 4 or 5 inches off the ground.  But the MESA was sitting right on the ground!  We had to pick it way up, and the ALSEP was less than eye level, really, (in the SEQ Bay).<p>

work that out in about an hour or so.<p>

pretty well convinced that we couldn't do a heck of a lot more, but I
think...It's just like any other training exercise.  Once you sit around
for a couple of hours, you're ready to go again.  I think we are.<p>

<b>130:42:17</b> Slayton: Rog.  Can't win them all, John.  That was a
beautiful job; you guys were right on the line all the way.  For your
information, we do have some people playing around with a potential fix to
that heat flow thing; but my personal opinion is that it ain't going to
work.  I don't think it's worth the bother, but we'll talk to you about
that later, if it looks like it's at all possible.<p>

<b>130:42:51</b> Young: Roger.

<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It seems to me that you guys hit the ground running on
this EVA.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  I think, looking back, we were real pleased with
how it went.  We didn't have any more problems with the little crummy
stuff, like we'd had in training.  You know, we had a few of those little
problems; but it was what we all expected and we were just used to 'em.  I
guess, if you were going through it for the first time and you had all
those problems, you'd really have been frustrated.  But we had been through it in training so much and had all those same problems that we just didn't get flustered.  We were really excited and looking forward to the next day.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Similar kinds of problems but different sets.  But
there'd always be something that'd...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, I think that's the value of training, Eric. 
That's why you need to train over and over again for these kind of
missions, because it's the little things that bite you.  You just really
need to be as familiar as you can with all your procedures and all your equipment.  And thank God John and I...Most of the crews understood that and they just went over and over and over again - in the suit...I mean, you got to train exactly like you're going to wear it and exactly like it's going to be.  You need good, high-fidelity training equipment; (and) not only on the spacecraft and the simulator, but also on this EVA stuff.  You know, going back to the Moon again or to Mars, you've got to have high-fidelity training.  Stuff's got to work like it's supposed to work.  Well, the experiment doesn't have to work but it's got to deploy right and you've got to know how to work it.  The same way it works for real, it's got to work that way in training, or you just get hopelessly lost.  Frustrated.  So it's really important to train.  Those guys going out 30 days on Mars are going to really need to be well trained.  I don't now how you're going to train for that, really.  It would be a lot of repetition, I'm sure.  That's probably the saving grace of it all, because you just keep repeating things.  It's critical to know your gear and to have training gear that matches the flight gear.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Were there problems, early on in training, with things
appearing late?  I mean, Pete said at one point, when he folded down the MESA, something like 'Gee, everything I've seen before'.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  We were in pretty good shape.  We kept pushing them for the L&amp;A, the landing model.  But they got that in plenty of time for us.  Prior to that, we'd been using the 15 one - our procedures, but their model.  But I don't remember anything else being a problem.  You know, we modified a few things based on 15; but they were minor and, so, they caught up and we had a chance to train with them.  Like <a href="a16LRVseatbelts.html" target="new">seatbelts</a> on the Rover and things like that.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So it was getting fairly mature by the time you flew
16.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh.  The system pipeline was full...You know, Neil
and them, they trained, I think, about three or four months; and we trained two years, really.  It doesn't take that long to get ready; but you had to reach a level peak and just try to hold that level in your training on out to your launch.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I don't know if you've ever thought about it, but I
engaged in a little idle speculation a few months ago that, if there was still money, if things had continued and NASA had had a go ahead for a base camp and a go ahead to start engineering on an unmanned, cargo-only LM....Take the Ascent Stage off, put a cargo module on, set it down some place, send a crew, and get started on a base camp.  (See, for example, Donald A. Beattie's </i>Taking Science to the Moon<i>.)  Was the program mature enough by the time of 16 or 17 to have had people start trying out procedures for that eventuality?  Try out some construction things and what have you?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah; they'd have been able to do it.  Yeah, we
could have done that.  To me it was a real sophisticated program; everybody knew their job and the training guys we refer to in here were always a great help and they always knew the systems and you could always turn to them for an answer and they knew it.  We were real mature.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

coming down and just reflecting into the spacecraft.  It was like a reverse
telescope, you see, and it was shining in and lighting up the whole
cockpit.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And shining up on John's hammock?  Would it have been at about AOT level?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, it wasn't that high; but it was enough to diffuse
into the whole spacecraft.  So you turn the AOT, on the outside, away from the Sun and it helped solve the problem.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;The 11 crew and the 12 crew complained about noise in the spacecraft.  And I think the 14 guys used earplugs or something like that but I don't remember any of the J-mission crews talking about noise.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;No ECS whirs or anything like that?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, there was some hum and the separator's going and converters and stuff...Well, I guess we had AC power down at this point, even.  So we didn't even have any inverters.  It might have been the inverters (that bothered 11 and 12) or it might have been the IMU and all that stuff.  We powered all that stuff down and all the J missions did.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;They kept all that powered up, as far as I remember.  So it could have been some of that.  So the only thing I had...My mind's going - racing - so the second night, again, I took a Seconal.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I slept in my LCG.  I don't remember (but) John might
have taken his LCG off.  I slept in mine; and I left the urine collection
device on.  John, I think, maybe took his off.  Any way, we'd slept...I
remember sleeping in my LCG and I think that what John did, too.  It was
