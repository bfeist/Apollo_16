<b>171:12:07</b> Young: Okay, the Cabin warning light's off.  &quot;Cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5 (psi).  Use purge valve to depress PGA as req-ed (sic)&quot;.<p>

<b>171:12:14</b> Duke: We don't have to.<p>

<b>171:12:16</b> Young: We don't have to?<p>

<b>171:12:17</b> Duke: No.

<blockquote><i>[The dialog indicates that the cabin is now repressurized.  The noise that began at the start of repressurization is still present, indicating that we are hearing comm noise.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:12:18</b> Young: Stand by the EV circuit breaker configuration.<p>

<b>171:12:20</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<blockquote><i>[They may have to turn to be able to see the circuit breaker panels.  Now that the suits are deflated, this is much easier than it would have been prior to repressurization.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:12:22</b> Young: Okay.  &quot;Verify circuit breaker configuration&quot;.<p>

<b>171:12:27</b> Duke: Mine is good.  I'm gonna put the Suit Fan Delta-P and the Suit Fan 2, in.<p>

<b>171:12:33</b> Young: Okay.  &quot;Suit Fan 2, closed; Suit Fan Delta-P, closed.&quot;<p>

<b>171:12:36</b> Duke: Okay, that's done.<p>

<b>171:12:37</b> Young: &quot;ECS caution and Water Separate (means Water Separator) lights out&quot;.  Okay. &quot;Doff gloves and stow on the comm panel.&quot;<p>

<b>171:12:43</b> Duke: Turn up your Anun/Numerics, John, so we can see this thing.<p>

<b>171:12:47</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>171:12:48</b> Duke: Yeah, they are.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:12:55</b> Young: Man, if we get those gloves off, I don't know if we're ever gonna get them back on again.<p>

<b>171:12:59</b> Duke: Me, either.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:13:04</b> England: And, John, verify you locked the <a href="../forward_hatch.jpg" title="Frank O'Brien CAM photo" target="new">forward hatch</a>.<p>

<b>171:13:08</b> Young: Man, I got one of them off.  (Answering Tony)  The forward hatch is locked!<p>

<b>171:13:12</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>171:13:18</b> Young: (Laughing) But I don't know...If there's somebody out there that wants to come in...Are you guys pulling my leg, down there?  You keep...<p>

<b>171:13:30</b> England: No, we sure don't want anybody to get in.

<blockquote><i>[All of the crews found it impossible to open the hatch - even just a little - unless the cabin pressure was 0.2 psi or less.  Now that the cabin pressure is about 5 psi, it would be impossible for anybody to open it.  John is amazed that someone in Houston is concerned.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:13:34</b> Young: Yeah, that's right.  (Exaggerating) There's 5000 psi on that door.  (Pause)  At least.  Whew.  &quot;Verify safety on the <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a>.&quot;<p>

<b>171:13:51</b> Duke: Okay, it is.<p>

<b>171:13:54</b> Young: The one up top you did?<p>

<b>171:13:55</b> Duke: Wait a minute.  No, I didn't get that one.  Sorry, John.  I was looking at the one down below.

<blockquote><i>[As indicated previously, Charlie has been using the overhead <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a>, so a check of the safety on the dump valve in the forward hatch is largely superfluous.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:14:00</b> Duke: Okay, it's safe.<p>

<b>171:14:02</b> Young: &quot;Descent Water Valve to Open.&quot;<p>

<b>171:14:03</b> Duke: Okay, it's Open.<p>

<b>171:14:04</b> Young: &quot;Remove purge valve, stow in <a href="../a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="new">purse</a>.  Disconnect OPS O2 hoses.&quot;<p>

<b>171:14:11</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>171:14:17</b> Duke: Huh?<p>

<b>171:14:21</b> Young: Okay.  I can't get that, Charlie.<p>

<b>171:14:27</b> Duke: I'll get it.  You'll get your hands dirty.<p>

<b>171:14:32</b> Young: (Laughter)  Before this is over with, those hands are going to be...<p>

<b>171:14:41</b> Duke: You know... Oh, it was already open.  Had to pull it out.  Okay.  &quot;Safety, Descent&quot;, we did... &quot;Disconnect OPS hoses.&quot;<p>

<b><a name="1711455">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1711455.mp3" target="new">9 min 36 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>171:14:56</b> Young: &quot;Disconnect OPS hoses.&quot;<p>

<b>171:15:06</b> Duke: That's the wrong one.  The wrong one.<p>

<b>171:15:12</b> Young: (Garbled), Charlie.  Back yet?<p>

<b>171:15:16</b> Duke: Okay.  Huh?<p>

<b>171:15:18</b> Young: Back yet?<p>

<b>171:15:19</b> Duke: Huh?  Yeah, that's beautiful.  I...<p>

<b>171:15:22</b> Young: Okay, let me get yours...  The outboard one here, too.<p>

<b>171:15:29</b> Duke: Okay, yours is off.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:15:46</b> Duke: Okay, now we got to get the LM O2 hoses.<p>

<b>171:15:50</b> Young: Okay, let me get just one water.<p>

<b>171:15:52</b> Duke: No, we got to take...  See, we get these on and...<p>

<b>171:15:57</b> Young: Okay, you're right.<p>

<b>171:15:58</b> Duke: This thing, see?<p>

<b>171:15:59</b> Young: You're right, you're right, you're right.<p>

<b>171:16:00</b> Duke: We got to depress right away.<p>

<b>171:16:02</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Once they get hooked up to the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">LM ECS</a> and to LM Comm, they will remove the PLSSs and prepare for a final equipment jettison.  They are on about 2/3rds of the way down the right-hand column on Surface Checklist page 7-1.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:16:16</b> Duke: (Connecting John's LM oxygen hose)  In and locked!<p>

<b>171:16:19</b> Young: It'd be a miracle if I can get that.  (Long Pause) <p>

<b>171:16:31</b> Duke:  Okay.  Got it finally.  Routed it under...  Here, let me get mine off.  (Long Pause)  Okay, let's get everything over here.  (Pause)  (Garbled)<p>

<b>171:17:01</b> Young: Yeah;  excuse me, Charlie.<p>

<b>171:17:02</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>171:17:03</b> Young: Oops...  Here we go.<p>

<b>171:17:09</b> Duke: Those things seem backwards to me, the PLSSs.<p>

<b>171:17:11</b> Young: They sure are.  (Long Pause)  There you go;  and they're locked.<p>

<b>171:17:48</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:17:59</b> Young: They're locked.<p>

<b>171:18:00</b> Duke: Okay, &quot;<a href="../lm_suit_isolation_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Suit Isol(ation Valve)</a>, both,&quot; going to Suit Flow.  (Pause)  Let me turn the...  Ooh, that feels good.  Turn the (PLSS) &quot;Pump, Off, and the Fan, Off&quot;.  Okay, &quot;disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA, connect LM H2O&quot;.<p>

<b>171:18:20</b> Young: There goes yours.  Okay, your water hose...  Here it is.  What a ball of spaghetti.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:18:35</b> Duke: That thing's about 95 feet long, John.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:18:46</b> Young: Okay, I got it.<p>

<b>171:18:47</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:18:54</b> Young: Let me get your water.<p>

<b>171:18:55</b> Duke: Yeah.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:19:04</b> Young: Is that yours?<p>

<b>171:19:05</b> Duke: Mine's right here.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:19:16</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<blockquote><i>[They have completed Surface Checklist page 7-1 and, next, will connect to LM Comm.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:19:17</b> Duke: Okay.  &quot;Disconnect PLSS H2O from PGA.&quot;  &quot;Connect...&quot;  (Now on page 7-2) &quot;PLSS mode, both, to off... (correcting himself) O&quot;, rather.  We open the (Audio) CB (circuit breaker)s and connect to LM comm.  Okay.<p>

<b>171:19:26</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>171:19:27</b> Duke: Tony, we're going off comm for a second.<p>

<b>171:19:29</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:20:36</b> England: Okay, and, Charlie, when you get a chance, could you pull that MESA circuit breaker?  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:21:10</b> Young: (To Charlie) Okay.  Terrible, isn't it?  &quot;Audio circuit breakers, Close;  Squelch, VHF B, LMP noise threshold, plus 1-1/2;  Audio, CDR and LMP:  VHF A to Receive;  B to Off;  ICS/PTT.&quot;  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:21:42</b> England: And, when you get a chance up there, the MESA circuit breaker, open.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:22:13</b> Duke: Tony, y'all want high-bit-rate?  Over.<p>

<b>171:22:17</b> England: Stand by one.  Did you catch that about MESA circuit breaker?<p>

<b>171:22:27</b> Duke: It is open.<p>

<b>171:22:28</b> England: Okay, good show.  No, we can't handle high-bit-rate now.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Public Affairs reports that the poor communications - and, by implication, Houston's inability to receive high-bit-rate data - is due, primarily to the fact that the LM high-gain steerable is unavailable and, also, because reception is through the 85-foot dish in Spain rather than the 210-foot dish at Goldstone, California.]<p>

<b>171:32:50</b> Duke: Okay, Houston; Orion.  We've performed the <a href="../A15-17EMUv2Sec4.2.1.jpg" title="image" target="new">OPS checkout</a> (near the middle of the right-hand column on <a href="a16surf7-2_3.jpg" target="new">page 7-2</a>) and they are both good.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's next transmission relates to the first item on page 7-2: &quot;Prep for Equip Jett 1&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:39:17</b> Duke: There's really not anything in there but the shovel.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:39:32</b> Duke: Yeah, I don't think it's necessary to put that back in the sack.  All they're doing it for is weight.  You don't have to (garbled).  &quot;Unstow scale, weigh Buddy SLSS/rock bag, and collection bags.&quot;  Okay, here we go with the...  First, the big rock (garbled).  (Pause)


<blockquote><i>[ They are now weighing the sample containers.  They will record the weights on <a href="a16LMLS2-2.jpg" title="checklist page" target="new">page 2-2</a> of the LM Lunar Surface Checklist and will read them up to Tony after they finish.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:40:11</b> Duke: 65 pounds max, supposed to be.  (Correcting himself) 35 (terrestrial pounds maximum).  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:40:30</b> Duke: John.  Yeah, number 7.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:40:45</b> Duke: We can get one rock in there, I think.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:40:56</b> Duke: Yeah?  One that's been in the shade.  Get that one in there, that one will go in, too.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:41:11</b> Duke: That one will go.  Try it now.  That's all that's in there?  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:41:32</b> Duke: Baby rocks.  Well, let's call it 40, and see what they say.  They'll let us go with that, I'll bet you.  Buddy SLSS bag is 40 (pounds).  Bag 7, (garbled).  Huh?

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:43:23</b> Duke: Houston, Orion.  Over.<p>

<b>171:43:25</b> England: Go ahead, Charlie.<p>

<b>171:43:30</b> Duke: Okay.  We've got some weights for you, if you're ready to copy.<p>

<b>171:43:33</b> England: All set.<p>

<b>171:43:37</b> Duke: Okay.  The BSLSS rock bag, the big rocks, will weigh 40 pounds;  bag 7, SCB number 7, is 33;  SCB number 4 is 25;  SCB number 6 is 20.  I get a total out of that of about 118 (pounds).  Over.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:44:01</b> England: Okay, we concur.

<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:45:06</b> England: Okay.  We're working those numbers over here.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:45:20</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, we've got a weight-saver for you.  The 
<a href="../apollo.glossary.html#ISA" target="new">ISA</a> only weighs 10 (pounds).

<blockquote><i>[The maximum allowable weight on the ISA is 18 pounds.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:45:26</b> England: Okay.  ISA weighs 10.<p>

<b>171:45:29</b> Duke: Actually, it weighs 8 pounds.<p>

<b>171:45:31</b> England: Okay, 8.<p>

<b>171:50:05</b> Young: Okay, has some got to go back?<p>

<b>171:50:09</b> England: No, I think we're going to be able to find a way.  You got an in-plane launch, so things look pretty good.  But we're working it here.</blockquote>

<b>171:50:20</b> Slayton: (Joking) Probably have to throw that big one away, John.<p>

<b>171:50:22</b> Young: Okay, we're getting... We're getting to the point where we got to know...  (Listens to Deke)  Say again?<p>

<b>171:50:29</b> Slayton: We'll probably have to throw away that big one.<p>

<b>171:50:39</b> Young: Okay.  Well, we don't want to throw away any that don't need to be throwed away.  That's for sure.  (Pause)  I tell you, there's a couple more tons (of rocks) up here we missed.<p>

<b>171:51:02</b> England: Say again, John.<p>

<b>171:51:07</b> Young: I say, there's a couple of tons up here that we didn't pick up.

<blockquote><i>[Long Comm Break]<p>

[They are over the planned limit for samples and, in principle, would be cutting into propellant margins if they kept them all.  As Tony mentions, however, the Command Module orbit is perfectly lined up so that John and Charlie wouldn't have to apply any lateral thrust to achieve the rendezvous.  Nonetheless, the fact that Houston is taking a long time to make a decision about the over-limit samples is indicative of the pragmatic conservatism that motivated most operational decisions in Apollo.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:56:14</b> Young: Houston, we're about to the point (where) we're (garbled)  the jettison bag.<p>

<b>171:56:19</b> England: I'm sorry, Charlie... John, say again?<p>

<b>171:56:25</b> Young: Roger.  We're ready to tie up the <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a>.<p>

<b>171:56:28</b> England: Okay.  We're still trying to get a decision on these rocks down here, if you could hold on one.<p>

<b>171:56:38</b> Young: Don't want to miss the launch.  (Pause)  I'm just kidding, Tony.  Take as long as you need to, to get it right.  I know how that is.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:57:08</b> Duke: Tony, if it helps you out, this morning we jettisoned the CWG (Constant Wear Garment)s, the LCGs, all of the sleep restraints, everything like that.  That was a pretty big bag.<p>

<b>172:06:07</b> Young: Outstanding.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  We're going to press on with the old (pressure) integrity check now (on the right-hand column on page 7-3).  (Long Pause)<p>
