<b>164:16:12</b> Duke: Okay, Houston, six(teen)...Orion.  Over.  (Pause)<p>

<b>164:16:25</b> England: Orion, Houston.  Go ahead.<p>

<b>164:16:30</b> Duke: Okay.  I'm in my suit, Tony; and we're putting
John's suit on.<p>

<b>164:16:35</b> England: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Wake-up was at <a href="a16.eva3wake.html#1623832" target="new">162:38:32</a> and they had planned to start the LMP <a href="../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new">suit donning</a> about 1 hour 25 minutes later and the CDR suit donning about 25 minutes after that.  See checklist pages Surface 5-7, 5-8, and 5-9.  It has actually been 1 hour 38 minutes since wake-up and they are about 10 minutes ahead of the timeline.]</i></blockquote>

<b>164:17:19</b> England: Hey, Charlie.  How was it climbing back into that suit again?<p>

<b>164:17:30</b> Duke: Feels good once you get it on, but they sure are filthy.<p>

<b>164:17:35</b> England: I bet they are.<p>

<b>164:17:36</b> Duke: Get your hands really dirty.<p>

<b>164:17:38</b> England: Ah.

<b>164:32:43</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  I'm ready for the battery management
(on Surface 5-10).<p>

<b>164:32:49</b> England: Okay.  Stand by one.  (Long Pause)  Okay. 
Charlie, we'd like you to read your ED (Explosive Device) Volts.<p>

<b>164:33:50</b> Duke: If you...(Stops to listen) Those beauties are
hanging in there at 37 (volts).

<blockquote><i>[Earlier, Houston had told Charlie that they would like to do the Battery Management at 164:45 and Charlie was probably about to ask if Houston wanted to wait until that time.]</i></blockquote>

<b>164:33:53</b> England: Oh, that's always good news.  And we'd like the Batt 1 Hi-Volt, On;  the Lunar Battery, Off; and the Batt 2, On.<p>

<b>164:34:11</b> Duke: Okay.  That's done.<p>

<b>164:34:13</b> England: Okay.  That's it.<p>

<b>164:34:16</b> Duke: You got that...(Hears Tony)  Okay, Batts 1, 2, 3, and 4 are On.  Luny Batt is Off.<p>

<b>164:34:21</b> England: Rog.<p>

<b>164:34:35</b> England: Okay, we copy.

<blockquote><i>[These are the handwritten values in the on-board Surface Checklist and these were probably entered as John and Charlie got into their suits.]<p>

[Comm Break]</i></blockquote>

<b>164:37:39</b> England: Okay.  And you fellows are doing pretty good.  You're about 10 minutes ahead.<p>

<b>164:37:49</b> Duke: Okay.  Thank you.  Tony, this <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a> must weigh 100 pounds.<p>

<b>164:37:56</b> England: (Laughs).  Well, you'll just take off faster without it.  (Long Pause)  Besides, you're gonna replace all that with rocks.  (Long Pause)  Incidentally, you have about 123 pounds of rocks, which means you can get about another 100 pounds.<p>

<b>164:39:00</b> Young: We do, huh?

<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break.  During this Comm Break, they do the Cabin Prep on Surface 6-1 and the Equipment Prep and PLSS Donning on Surface 6-2.  NASA's Public Affairs commentator estimates the expected egress time between 166:10 and 166:25 but, as we shall see, John and Charlie are well ahead of that pace.]</i></blockquote>

<b>165:20:30</b> Duke: Okay?<p>

<b>165:20:35</b> Young: Okay, verify the following:  Helmet and visor aligned and adjusted; O2 connectors, three, locked; purge valve, locked; water connectors, one, locked; comm connector, one, locked; PGA diverter valve to vertical.

<blockquote><i>[As shown in <a href="../A14EMUHandbookV1FI-23.jpg" target="new">Figure I-23</a> in the <a href="../A14EMU-v1.pdf" target="new">EMU Handbook</a>, the diverter valve is part of the oxygen inflow connector and gives them the option of directing the  PLSS oxygen flow entirely into the helmet (the vertical position) or partly  into the suit torso (the horizontal position).  Generally, the astronauts put the diverter valve to horizontal only when they were in the cabin and were trying to dry the suits out a little. In the hoizontal position, used in the cabin, all the incoming oxygen stream is divided between a duct leading to the helmet vent and a duct leading the vents in the torso.  In the vertical position, used outside, all the oxygen goes to the helmet vent. <a href="../A14EMU-v1-f1-10.tif" title="image" target="new">Figure I-10</a> from the EMU Handbook shows the layout of the ducts.]</i></blockquote>
