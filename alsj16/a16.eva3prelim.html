<blockquote><i>[Gene Cernan will have a similar problem during Apollo
17.]<p>

[As Fendell looks toward the north, we see a trail of very dark
footprints.  These are crossed by a set of Rover tracks, which are not
nearly so dark.  The surface looks relatively soft and, on such a surface,
John and Charlie probably kicked a great deal of dirt around as they
walked.  In contrast, the primary effect of the Rover wheels is to compact
the surface and, at least at low speeds, only a small amount of soil is
picked up by the wire mesh and scattered on the undisturbed surface on
either side of the tracks.  Jack Schmitt has speculated that, during the
landing, the descent engine sweeps away large numbers of very small
particles and leaves a surface with a higher-than-normal population of
larger particles.  These are effective sunlight reflectors and the net
result is a bright surface in the immediate vicinity of the LM.  Schmitt
speculates that, when the surface is disturbed by walking astronauts or by
the Rover, the surface is actually restored to something more closely
resembling its normal reflectivity and looks dark in comparison to the
brightened soil.  This scene seems to support Schmitt's
conjecture.]</i></blockquote>

working; and so I ran out 50 to 100 yards to the north of the Rover and turned around and tried to sight on something between the LM and Stone Mountain.  And my thought was, we can always see Stone Mountain and I'll pick a spot and we'll just aim for that spot on Stone Mountain and, if we've been going mostly directly north, when we come back, if we're not in our tracks, we'd just head for that point.

things; a lot of the landmarks, you know, are down in those swales and all,
and they all just disappear.  You know, if you went out and back in your
set of tracks, you're okay; but the big loops we did, like on EVA-2, when
we thought we lost the Nav, John was biasing back to the east so that,
eventually, we'd run across our tracks.  But, you know, you could be a
hundred yards away from something and, if you're on the wrong side of the
hill, you wouldn't see it.  I'm glad we had the Navigation system.  I would
have hated to have been up there without one.&quot;]<p>

<b>166:05:39</b> Young: PMW  (means PWM) is in Both.  And the Drive Enable
is in...All those switches are up.  And the steering is okay.  Going to
Primary.  (Pause)  Coming around for a Nav align.  (Pause)

<b>166:06:16</b> Young: I think I'd better get up here on this level
spot.<p>

<b>166:06:20</b> Duke: (Agreeing) Umm.  (Pause)<p>

<b>166:06:25</b> Young: Charlie, now what...<p>

<b>166:06:27</b> Duke: That feels pretty level.<p>

<b>166:06:28</b> Young: Yeah, I reckon.<p>

<b>166:06:29</b> Duke: I reckon too.<p>

<b>166:06:31</b> England: Right.  On the Drive Enables, we'd like the Left
Rear and the Right Rear to PWM-2.<p>

<b>166:06:41</b> Young: Yeah, we've got that.  It's normal
configuration.<p>

<b>166:06:43</b> England: Okay, good show.  That's what we want.<p>

<b>166:06:45</b> Duke: Okay, we're in 3 degrees right roll.  Hey, the pitch
needle is behind there, and I would say it's saying 2 degrees pitch up if
the little needle was right in the middle.  But it isn't very much (pitch),
Houston.<p>

<b>166:07:03</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[During the drive up Stone Mountain to Station 4, the pitch
scale de-bonded and fell into the bottom of the instrument, but the
indicator needle stayed in place.  John got used to the pitch indicator
during training and can estimate his pitch from the position of the needle
relative to the case.]</i></blockquote>

<b>166:07:04</b> Young: What happened on that indicator is that the dial
has falling off, if you can believe such a thing.  The little needle is
still back there.  It don't know the dial's fallen off, and it's working
fine.  One degree right roll. ...<p>

<b>166:07:19</b> England: Okay, we copy that, and we need an SSD
(Sun-Shadow Device) reading.<p>

<b>166:07:21</b> Young: ...And I think we're pretty well level in pitch. 
(Stops to listen)  Three and a half degrees right. Almost four.  No, three
degrees right, excuse me.<p>

<b>166:07:31</b> England: Okay, copy.<p>

<b>166:07:33</b> Duke: And we're...Our...<p>

<b>166:07:38</b> England: And if...<p>

<b>166:07:39</b> Duke: Our heading is 264, if you can believe such a
thing.<p>

<b>166:07:43</b> England: Okay, and if you want to power up...<p>

<b>166:07:44</b> Young: That's about right on.<p>

<b>166:07:45</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>166:07:46</b> England: I'd like the LRV readings.<p>

<b>166:07:51</b> Young: We're powered up.<p>

<b>166:07:53</b> Duke: Okay, 60 on the left.  Okay, 264, 000, 000, 000,
amp-hours is 60, 115;  off-scale low, off-scale low.  Okay, volts are 65,
65; 102, 120, off-scale low, off- scale low;  and off-scale low, off-scale
low.<p>

<b>166:08:27</b> England: Okay, we'll stick with the normal configuration
you've got there, and we'd like to verify that you went back to Amps on the
readout.<p>

<b>166:08:41</b> Young: That's verified.<p>

<b>166:08:43</b> England: Okay.  (Pause) Okay, we've got 258 on the
torquing angle.  (Pause)<p>

<b>166:08:52</b> Young: The rascally thing is only off...(Stops to listen) 
Okay, 258.<p>

<b>166:09:08</b> Young: How about that?  I put my (PLSS) Diverter in
Minimum; I didn't think I'd reach it on this round.
