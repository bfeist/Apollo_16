<b>125:10:56</b> England: Stand by a second.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's camera is loaded with B&amp;W film and,
apparently, he had planned to use John's camera to photograph the Solar Wind with color film.  There is, however, no mention of this on <a href="a16.lmpev129.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-29</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:11:01</b> Duke: I've already got it on; I hope you say
&quot;yes&quot;. <p>

<b>125:11:03</b> England: Yeah, go ahead.<p>

<b>125:11:07</b> Duke: Okay.  Thank you.

<b>125:11:10</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  (As per 
<a href="a16.lsp077.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-40</a>) You're going to (<a href="../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="new">LCRU mode switch</a> position) 3 (FM/TV).<p>

<b>125:11:13</b> England: Okay.  (Burst of static)<p>

<b>125:11:24</b> Duke: (Static clear) every one of them.<p>

<b>125:11:25</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>125:11:26</b> Duke: And we didn't see any at the other two craters.<p>

<b>125:11:30</b> Young: We might have missed some, but I agree I didn't...<p>

<b>125:11:35</b> Duke: Tony, I'd say 15 percent of these rocks are glass coated, and at stops 1 and 2, we didn't see any (glass-coated rocks).<p>

<b>125:11:45</b> England: And, Charlie, while you got the camera, taking pictures there, we'd like you to go around and look at that cosmic ray and take a picture of it, and read off the Tempa label.<p>

<b>125:11:56</b> Duke: Yeah.  I already took a picture of it (early in the EVA).  I got the...<p>

<b>125:11:58</b> England: Okay.  We're going to need a Tempa label reading.<p>

<b>125:12:00</b> Duke: ...7-footer in color.  (Hearing Tony) Okay.  I'll go read the temp.  You want another picture?<p>

<b>125:12:09</b> England: No, we don't need another picture.  You might comment if there's any dust on it.<p>

<b>125:12:16</b> Duke: No, it's clean as a whistle.  (Pause)  And, buddy, it must be hot.  All of the labels, all three on each side, are black.  It's over 140.

<blockquote><i>[Various piece of equipment have sets of temeprature sensitive labels attached.  At a particular temperature, some of the labels will be white and the others will have changed to black, thus making a coarsely-graded thermometer.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:12:30</b> England: Okay.  We'd like you to take it off and put it on the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Y</a> (south) strut, in the shade.<p>

<b>125:12:39</b> Duke: Okay.  John will have to do that.<p>

<b>125:12:42</b> England: Okay.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>125:13:03</b> England: Okay.  And, Charlie, we'd like to press on with the closeout.<p>

<b>125:13:08</b> Duke: And that's what I'm doing.<p>

<b>125:13:10</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1251313">125:13:13</a></b> Duke: I've gotten John's bag (from under the CDR seat) now, and I'm gonna empty it in the SRC, keeping the core tubes out.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:13:37</b> Duke: John, I think we've raised this thing (meaning the MESA) too high.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[In Houston, there is an ongoing discussion about putting Charlie's SCB-5 in the rock box instead of John's SCB-1.  Apparently, SCB-1 was &quot;clean&quot; (probably meaning it had flown to the Moon in the rock box and was known to be sterile), while SCB-5 was not.  On the other hand, SCB-5 contains most of the soil samples from this EVA and the Backroom would liked to keep those under vacuum conditions in the rock box.  In the end, Jim Lovell, the spokesman for the Backroom, tells the Flight Director that they want the contents of SCB-5 in the rock box.]<p>

<b>125:13:58</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  You should have us now.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has been working at the MESA and comes to the Rover carrying SCB-1, which is now empty.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:14:25</b> Duke: John, can you take my bag off?  I'm ready to press.  You've got a whole bag.  I emptied yours in there, and it didn't even fill in the SRC, so take my bag off and...<p>

<b>125:14:36</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>125:14:37</b> Duke: ...I'll get on with this.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie turns slightly to present his SCB.  John comes over and goes to his knees to release the fasteners at the bottom.  After a few seconds, he hops up.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:14:39</b> England: Okay, guys.  We'd like to switch out the SCBs in the rock box.  And we'd like to put (Charlie's) SCB-5 in there instead of (John's) SCB-1.<p>

<b><a name="1251449">125:14:49</a></b> Duke: Tony, I've already emptied SCB-1 in there.

<blockquote><i>[John lifts SCB-5 off Charlie's PLSS and, on the side that was against the PLSS we see a metal band which fit over two upturned metal tabs on side of Charlie's PLSS.  See Figure <a href="a16mrf14-62.jpg" title="image" target="new">14-62</a> from the Apollo 16 Mission Report.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:14:56</b> Young: Most of SCB-5 can go in there too, Houston. <p>

<b>125:14:59</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>125:15:00</b> England: Okay.  Great.<p>

<b>125:15:01</b> Duke: I think I can get them both in there.  I'm emptying them in, Tony.<p>

<b>125:15:03</b> England: Good show.

<blockquote><i>[John gives SCB-5 to Charlie and goes off-camera to the left.  Charlie heads for the MESA and <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pans left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:15:04</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  Like we planned, I'm just emptying them into there.<p>

<b>125:15:09</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>125:15:10</b> Duke: And it packs easier that way.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The alternative is to put the entire SCB in the rock box and, obviously, that takes up more room.  In addition, by pouring the individual sample bags in, Charlie can fill the corners in the box more effectively.]<p>

[John comes into view with the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">dustbrush</a> and starts cleaning the
front of the Rover as per 
<a href="a16.lsp077.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-40</a>.  A <a href="a16brush.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> from training photo <a href="images16.html#KSC71PC777" target="new">KSC-71PC-777</a> shows the dustbrush stowed on the front of the training Rover.]
</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1251524">125:15:24</a></b> Young: Boy, old LCRU, you are dusty.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[After cleaning the TCU (Television Control Unit) mirror, John uses the dustbrush on the TV lens.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:15:42</b> England: Thank you, John.<p>

<b>125:15:47</b> Young: Say again?<p>

<b>125:15:48</b> England: I said, &quot;thank you&quot;.<p>

<b>125:15:52</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John goes off-camera to the left to stow the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">dustbrush</a> on its bracket on the high-gain antenna.  Fendell resumes his
counter-clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:15:58</b> England: And, Charlie, we'll need your frame count sometime. <p>

<b>125:16:03</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>125:16:04</b> Young: Okay, Houston, (as per <a href="a16.lsp077.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-40</a>) going to Reset on the far UV.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>125:16:26</b> England: And, John, we have a new (UV camera) target for you.<p>

<b>125:16:32</b> Young: Okay.  Go ahead.<p>

<b><a name="1251633">125:16:33</a></b> England: 204, azimuth; elevation 26.<p>

<b>125:16:42</b> Young: Boy, Charlie, you have to watch that battery cable.  It's way up in the air around this thing.<p>

<b>125:16:46</b> Duke: I know it.<p>

<b>125:16:48</b> Young: Say again the azimuth, Houston.<p>

<b>125:16:49</b> England: 204.<p>

<b>125:16:53</b> Young: No, you keep clipping out your first number.<p>

<b>125:16:56</b> England: Roger.  That's azimuth 204, elevation 26.<p>

<b>125:17:04</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)  I can't believe that!  (Long
Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was just before ingress when we reset the (UV) camera (and) that son-of-a-gun really was hard to turn in azimuth; and I didn't think I was going to be able to turn it.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit and reverses
direction.  Although we can see most of the LM shadow, John is probably
just off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>

<p>

<b>125:17:39</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  This thing is getting tighter and tighter in turning in the azimuth.  I bet you it ain't going to make it
much longer.(Pause)  204 and 26.<p>

<b>125:18:02</b> England: Rog.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;To move the camera in azimuth completely destroyed any leveling.  As the mission went on, to move the camera in azimuth got harder and harder and, finally, it got so hard that, every time you moved it, it would pick the camera up off the ground and destroy the level.  I had to re-level it after every setting and that took a lot of time.  And, in some cases, because we were really in a hurry, I didn't get the level where I would have like to have had it, as far as being perfectly level.  Adjusting the level, using the wheels, just couldn't compensate for both the slope and picking the thing up every time.  From that standpoint, it was pretty bad.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;There was something wrong with the azimuth; it just got
stickier and stickier.  It didn't work at all like on the training model or either qual model.  I don't know what it could have been.  But, I would devote a reasonable amount of time to leveling the camera after each setting.  I think we have probably devoted three to four times as much time as we'd allotted for each setting.  I got behind doing that.&quot;]
</i></blockquote>

<b>125:18:20</b> Duke: Ah! I can't believe it.<p>

<b>125:18:22</b> Young: Okay; 204 and 26. <p>

<b>125:18:25</b> England: Sounds good.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:18:34</b> Young: Okay.  It (meaning the UV camera) may see a little (bit of the) LM there, Houston.  (If) that's what you want; we'll leave it there.<p>

<b>125:18:41</b> England: Okay.  And, John, we'd like you to go to <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">Intermediate on your cooling</a>.<p>

<b>125:18:49</b> Young: Yeah.  Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:19:00</b> Duke: John, you've got to move the cosmic ray.<p>

<b>125:19:04</b> Young: Oh, yeah.  Okay.  (I'll) get it right now.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[There is no mention of the cosmic ray experiment on 
<a href="a16.lmpev129.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-29</a> and, after the trouble John had with it at about 
<a href="a16.alsepoff.html#1203845" target="new">120:38:45</a>, he
may have left it in the wrong place.]<p>

[Fendell finds Charlie carrying the 16-mm camera from the MESA to the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:19:14</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  We got all the rocks that we collected, except for a couple of biggies, into the SRC.  Over.<p>

<b>125:19:21</b> England: Outstanding, Charlie.  The reason for putting those others in there, is they wanted the soils in the SRC.<p>

<b>125:19:30</b> Duke: Yeah.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The soil samples will be analyzed for volatile content, meaning the type and quantity of constituents that can be driven off with the application of heat and collected as gasses.]<p>

[Fendell completes the clockwise pan and, as he looks over the top of the console, we watch Charlie securing the 16-mm camera on his inboard handhold.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:19:37</b> Young: Okay.  You want white ring.  (Is that) right, Tony?<p>

<b>125:19:42</b> England: White ring.  That's right.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is doing something with the cosmic ray experiment.  Fendell pans counter-clockwise.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It looks like there's quite a bit of rock close to the
LM.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, scattered around.  (At 119:39:33), I had estimated
it, you know, 20 to 30 percent, and it's just not that much.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;But a lot more than there were out, say, at
Flag.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I think we were on a ray,
here.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It's striking.  It's dramatically higher concentration
than around the 15 or 17 landing sites, because of the
ray.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:20:02</b> Duke: (Probably working at the Rover) Dog you.  Come out of there.  Man; you know, I said the battery covers weren't going to get dusty?<p>

<b>125:20:14</b> Young: Houston, I don't know how to tell you this, but
cosmic ray unlocks down at the bottom, but it won't unlock up at the top. 
Which way do I push it or pull it?<p>

<b>125:20:27</b> England: It should be a lift-off.  Straight up. 
Correction.  Straight out.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[I have been unable to find these cosmic ray procedures in the checklists.]<p>

[Fendell stops the pan to look at the U.S. Flag and then pans up and
slightly left to find the Rover high-gain antenna.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:20:42</b> Young: Okay.  That's what it is.  Fantastic.  (Pause) 
Okay.  It's set away from the Sun on the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Y</a> (south footpad).<p>

<b>125:20:59</b> England: Okay.  That sounds good.<p>

<b>125:21:06</b> Young: And Charlie's right; it's up there (meaning that it is very hot).  Charlie, be careful when you go past the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">minus-Y</a>.<p>

<b>125:21:20</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Once Fendell finds the high-gain antenna, he pans up along the right edge until he finds Earth.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1252133">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1252133.mp3" target="new">9 min 16 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>125:21:33</b> England: Hey, fellows, we're able to see the Earth with
your big eye there.<p>

<b>125:21:39</b> Duke: How about that.  Pretty sight, isn't it?<p>

<b>125:21:43</b> England: Sure is.  Man, that's weird.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell zooms in on Earth and, at maximum zoom, it covers about one quarter of the horizontal width of the field-of-view.  The
Earth's angular diameter from the Moon is about 2 degrees and,
consequently, the field-of-view is about 8 degrees wide.  A bit more than
half of the disk of the Earth is in shadow and, on the sunlit portion, the
blue of the oceans can be seen.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:21:48</b> Young: Okay.  Houston, the way I had to set it to make it stand up against the strut, I'd say it has an angle of 50 or 60 degrees to the Sun.  And the Sun is shining on the back of it, because the strut won't shield it completely, if you know what I mean.  The base of it is down in the footpad, and the top of it is sticking out past the strut.<p>

<b>125:22:18</b> England: Okay.  We copy that, John.

<blockquote><i>[AS16-107-
<a href="images16.html#17441" target="new">17441</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#17442" target="new">17442</a> is a pair of photos of the cosmic ray John takes at
the start of EVA-2.]<p>

[Fendell pulls back on the zoom and lowers his aim.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:22:23</b> Duke: Tony, my frame count...<p>

<b>125:22:24</b> England: That's no problem, John.  That's good.<p>

<b>125:22:25</b> Duke: ...on magazine Bravo.<p>

<b>125:22:29</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[As Houston realizes in a few moments, Charlie has
mis-spoken.  He has been using magazine Golf.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:22:31</b> Duke: You finished with your pictures, John? <p>

<b>125:22:33</b> Young: No.  I haven't done those yet.<p>

<b>125:22:34</b> Duke: Okay.  Tony, my frame count on magazine Bravo was 120.<p>

<b>125:22:39</b> England: Okay; 120.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:22:49</b> Duke: And I'm helping John load up.  I'm doing the ETB
right now, while he's taking pictures (of the UV camera).<p>

<b>125:22:56</b> England: Okay. (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As per <a href="a16.lsp079.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-41</a>, John was supposed to load the cameras, magazines, and other gear into the ETB but, because of the UV camera, he is behind schedule.]<p>

[After looking at the Solar Wind Collector for a few seconds, Fendell
lowers his aim and examines the surface between the SWC and the Rover.  He then pans right, still looking at the surface near the
Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1252326">125:23:26</a></b> Young: (Reading

<a href="images16.html#18436" target="new">18436</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>125:23:41</b> England: Charlie, was your magazine Bravo or Golf?<p>

<b>125:23:48</b> Duke: Whatever the one the checklist said.<p>

<b>125:23:55</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>125:23:56</b> Duke: I'll tell you inside;  I'm bringing it inside.<p>

<b>125:23:57</b> England: Okay.  That's fine.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:24:06</b> Duke: Okay.  I've got all the film, John.<p>

<b>125:24:08</b> Young: Okay, Charlie.<p>

<b><a name="1252409">125:24:09</a></b> Duke: All I need is your camera, and the ETB is going over to the MESA table.  And I got a great big rock: a muley.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit, giving us a view of two empty SCBs in the LMP footpan.]<p>

[&quot;Muley&quot; is, of course, sample 61016 ( <a href="http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/curator/lunar/lsc/index.htm" target="new">External Link</a> ) , which Charlie collected on the rim of Plum Crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:24:19</b> Young: Houston, if I take a down-Sun, I'll have to stand in front of this contraption.  You want me to do that?  In front of the camera at 3 feet (focus)?

<blockquote><i>[If John stands too close to the UV camera and directly up-Sun, his shadow will fall on it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:24:31</b> England: I guess if you stand a few feet away from it, it shouldn't be too bad.  Move 8 or 10 feet away, though.<p>

<b><a name="1252440">125:24:40</a></b> Young: Okay.  I'll take it at 8 feet (focus).  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John takes two down-Suns from 8 feet: AS16-114-
<a href="images16.html#18437" target="new">18437</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18438" target="new">18438</a>.]<p>

[Next, he takes 
<a href="images16.html#18439" target="new">18439</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#18440" target="new">18440</a>, which are interesting cross-Suns from the south, showing Charlie in the background with the Rover and the flag to the left.]<p>

[John's final frame, 
<a href="images16.html#18441" target="new">18441</a>, is a picture toward the northwest across the LM shadow.]<p>

[David Harland has used 18439 to 18441 to create a 
<a href="a16.uvcam_dmh.jpg" title="image" target="new">mini-pan</a> and Dave Byrne has created an <a href="a16-18439-41.jpg" title="image" target="new">alternate version</a>.]<p>

[As Fendell raises his aim, Charlie returns to the LRV from the MESA
and leans across his seat.  When he straightens up, he is holding Big
Muley, sample 61016, which he holds up in sunlight in front of his
faceplate and examines.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1252453">125:24:53</a></b> Duke: Tony, I take that back (about not having seen glass-coated rocks at Stations 1 and 2).  That rock we picked up (next to the Rover at Station 1), the big - the muley - is...Oh, I was going to say, glass crystals;  but (I) take that back.  Part of it seems to be shocked, and it's a crystalline rock on the inside under all the dust. Whatever it is.

<a href="a16.lrvload.html#1201517" target="new">120:15:17</a>.  The pallet contains food, replacement batteries for the PLSSs and other gear.  According to the Final LM Stowage List, Apollo 16 carried a 10.5-pound (4.8-kg) 'food assembly' in  the LM ascent stage and two 4.6-pound (2.1-kg) 'food assemblies' in the descent stage.

[Jones - &quot;What can you tell me about getting in?  If you had put stuff on the engine cover, would that have hindered either of you getting in?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  Uh-uh.  There was the ascent engine cover and there was a shelf (usually called the '<a href="../alsj-LM-Midstep.html" target="new">midstep</a>').  The hatch was out here and you came in and you really bumped into the shelf and then the engine cover was back in here.  So you wiggled your way in and started (hand) walking up that little step.

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;When we opened the battery covers, the dirt just flew up in the air and came right back down on the batteries.  We had to dust the batteries.  I could see why they got dusty.  There's hardly any way to avoid it.  That was on the first EVA, before we lost any fenders.  We were relatively free of dust in the front of the vehicle other than what we accumulated on the front of it as we drove.&quot;]<p>

[Journal Contributor David Woods writes &quot;I had to smile at John Young's comment: 'When we opened the battery covers, the dirt just flew up in the air'. AIR! The conspiracy nuts will be using this as proof that Apollo was a fake. For myself, it just made me smile. :-) &quot;]<p>

[Charlie then looked in the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a> summary.]<p>

[Duke - (Reading) &quot;The primary had 5.2 pounds of LiOH and half a pound of activated charcoal and it was 41 man-hours at 520 Btu's per man-hour.  And the secondary canister had 3 pounds LiOH, 0.3 pounds of activated charcoal, and 18 man-hours at 520 Btu per man-hour.&quot;]<p>

<blockquote><i>[It is not clear whether Charlie is talking about the food
packages in the pallet or ones that were already in the LM.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It looked like it wasn't (completely) vacuum packed. 
You know, like a bag of peanuts on an airliner?  It was the same way.  The bags were just bulged.  Which means that they really weren't vacuum packed.&quot;]<p>

[David Woods writes, &quot;A small comment about the vacuum packed foods. I find it hard to imagine anything being packed on Earth that when exposed to the hard vacuum of the Moon wouldn't appear blown. At the very least, I would expect the food itself to begin outgassing in its container once its surroundings are depressurized.&quot;]<p>

[See the dialog at <a href="a16.debrief1.html#1284720" target="new">128:47:20</a> when Tony asks Charlie about the food packages, and Charlie replies that it was the overbag that had expanded.  The individual food packages had retained vacuum.]<p>

<blockquote><i>[John's statement may seem a bit ironic if one considers where he is and what he's doing.  Nonetheless, it underlines the fact that none of the Apollo astronauts took unnecessary risks.  When risk could be reduced by a cautious testing of the waters, the astronauts did so.  Then, once they were confident in what they were doing - whether it was landing the LM or climbing the ladder - they went ahead and did it.]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;John looked real stable to me coming up the ladder with the bags in his hand - the rock bags and the SRCs.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The technique I used (is), I'd stand at the bottom of the ladder and bend down and spring and I could get up to the second rung of the ladder with either the SRC or an SCB in my hand.  That is really the way to fly.  You feel like Superman jumping up off the ground like that.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:45:27</b> Duke: Okay, here comes the little 
<a href="a16.lrvload.html#1201215" target="new">doomaflicky</a> (meaning the empty pallet) out.  It landed on the porch.  (Long Pause)  John, I'm thinking it might be easier...Are you on the ladder yet?<p>

<b>125:46:04</b> Young: Huh?<p>

<b>125:46:05</b> Duke: Are you on the ladder?<p>

<b>125:46:06</b> Young: Yep.<p>

<b><a name="1254607">125:46:07</a></b> Duke: Good.  (Pause)  Don't fall there, babe.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;He was coming up one-handed with the SRC in one hand and you could rock off to one side.  So I was just telling him to be careful.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The way I would do it (meaning the equipment transfer) is, I'd put a bag on the LEC down at the end of the ladder, take the (other) bag in my hand and leap up the ladder, hand one of the bags to Charlie, and then pull up the LEC and hand the other bag to him.  That saved me a trip back down the ladder.  It was real easy to pull up the LEC.  You just lean against the ladder, do like this,
and the thing would come up and then you'd grab it down a little further and you could pull it up in 3- or 4-foot grabs, even though the actual weight of something like the ETB was probably a good 30 (terrestrial)
pounds with all the cameras and everything in it.&quot;]<p>

[John's description suggests that, at the top of the ladder, he took
hold of the LEC with his left hand, pulled it up sharply and, then, as the
LEC and the attached bag rose in the weak lunar gravity and reached the top of their trajectories, grabbed the LEC farther down.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;It was real easy and
I'm glad we went to that LEC because, once we got (the length) adjusted, we never got any dirt in the cockpit from it - although we got so much other dirt, I don't know if it made a lot of difference.&quot;]<p>

[The early crews used a version of the <a href="../alsj-lec.html" target="new">LEC</a> which Neil Armstrong
described as a &quot;Brooklyn clothesline&quot;.  The Commander would
attach a bag or rock box to the LEC and move out from the bottom of the
ladder to put tension on it.  Then, he or the LMP would reel the bag up
into the cabin.  The trouble with the clothesline LEC was that it tended to
pick up dirt and, as the crew pulled on it, the dust would fly off and coat
both the Commander and the inside of the cabin.  On Apollo 14, Ed Mitchell
carried some of the gear up the ladder by hand and, on Apollo 15, Dave
Scott and Jim Irwin made minimal use of their clothesline LEC.  Pre-flight,
John and Charlie decided that they would rather fly with a simple lanyard
which, regrettably, retained the LEC designation.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;I guess the
recommendation of the LEC is to put the (length) adjustment strap down at the bottom of it instead of at the top.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:46:30</b> Young: Okay, Charlie, here comes SRC-1. <p>

<b>125:46:33</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:46:38</b> Young: Can you get it?

<blockquote><i>[John is asking Charlie if he can bend down far enough to
get hold of the SRC.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I gather you couldn't get your hand out to the porch,
and  he'd have to put the rock box in through the hatch for you.  Is that
right?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I could reach down a little bit; and I think I was on
John's side at this time.  So, yeah, I could lean down and reach out a
little.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So, if he stood it up on the porch...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't think I could reach all the way out to the
porch.  No.  But he sort of shoved it in the hatch.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Partway in the hatch.&quot;]<p>

[The rock box was about 48 x 27 x 20 cm (18.9 x 10.6 x 7.9 inches). 
If John slid the box in with the long-dimension parallel to the floor,
Charlie would have to reach down to mid-calf.  If John pushed it in fully
upright, the top of the box would be at about knee
height.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:52:51</b> Young: Okay.  Oh, okay.  And underneath that is a flag for the old whatchacallit.  I'm not sure there's any sample containment bags in there, Char...Yeah, I guess maybe there are.  (Pause)  I'll bring them up separate, Charlie.  (To Houston)  You want me to reset the UV (as per <a href="a16.lsp081.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-42</a>) before I go up this time?

<blockquote><i>[The MESA stowage diagram ( <a href="a16.lsp025.jpg" title="image" target="new">145k</a> doesn't provide an immediate identification of the 'flag for the old whatchacallit'.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:53:18</b> England: Yeah, it would be a good idea.  Then you could just stay up.<p>

<b>125:53:20</b> Duke: (To John) Why don't you bring the...<p>

<blockquote><i>[The UV camera decal, Figure <a href="a16.lsp448.jpg" title="image" target="new">5.3-1</a> in the Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, indicates that the planned target for the next sixteen hours is a cluster of galaxies known as NGC 134 at an azimuth of 230 degrees and an elevation of 53 degrees.  At 
<a href="#1251633" target="new">125:16:33</a>, shortly after John arrived back at the LM, Houston had him point the UV camera at a target with an azimuth of 204 and an elevation of 26.  Readers should note that, unlike the Rover Nav system which uses north as zero azimuth, the UV camera uses west as zero azimuth. 
This can be confirmed by a comparison of the UV camera decal, Figure <a href="a16.lsp448.jpg" title="image" target="new">5.3-1</a>
in the Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, with Table 2.3-1 in the same volume.  In the table, the Sun's azimuth is listed as 87-plus degrees at the originally planned start time for EVA-1; and, because the Sun is low in the eastern sky, this table uses north as zero azimuth.  In that same table, Earth is listed at an azimuth of about -41 and elevation of about 78.  That is, Earth is not far from the zenith and down from it to the northwest.  On the decal, Earth is listed at an azimuth of 54 degrees and an elevation of 77 degrees, and the difference in azimuth in the two sources is easily explained if the UV camera settings assume zero azimuth is west.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:53:38</b> Duke: John, when you come up, if you remember to bounce your feet on the struts...<p>

<b>125:53:45</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>125:53:46</b> Duke: ...it'll clean them off.  That's what I'm doing up in the...by moving on the floor.<p>

<b>125:53:52</b> Young: Okay, (reading 
<a href="a16.lsp081.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-42</a>) &quot;ETB, then set the far UV&quot;.  What's the target, Houston?  I'm over at the far UV.<p>

<b>125:53:58</b> England: Okay.  Reset.  And then the target is 134 azimuth and 39 elevation.

<blockquote><i>[Note that this is not the target (No. 4) indicated on the
checklist.  Because the late landing, necessitated deploying the UV camera
closer to the LM, the target list is being changed in real
time.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:54:11</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  Okay, Houston; 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
Reset.  134 azimuth.  (Pause)  Houston, can I hit the Reset again?  I
didn't see the film move.  (Pause)  No; it did.<p>

<b>125:54:44</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>125:54:48</b> Young: Because it's re-moding.  Boy.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>125:55:03</b> England: Okay, that azimuth was 134.<p>

<b>125:55:10</b> Young: 134 is looking at the lunar module, Houston!  You don't want to do that.<p>

<b>125:55:17</b> England: Okay.  Would an elevation of 39 look over it?<p>

<b>125:55:25</b> Young: Heck, no.  It's at 26 now (and) it's not clearing
it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The LM is 7 meters tall and the horizontal distance from
the footpad to the point on the ground directly under the front of the top
surface is about 4.0 meters.  Consequently, if the UV camera were pointed directly at the LM, any target at an elevation of less than about 60 degrees would be blocked by the spacecraft.  However, because (1) the footpad is 4.7 meters from the spacecraft, (2) the UV camera is 2 meters southwest of the footpad, and (3) the horizontal radius of the Descent stage is about 2.2 meters, the LM blocks targets with azimuths roughly between 146 to 187 degrees - where zero azimuth is west in UV camera parlance.  Any target outside that range should be visible.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:55:39</b> Young: Well, let me see, it might.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:55:45</b> Duke: Okay, Houston, I just got a water flag.<p>

<b>125:55:48</b> Young: If you want to take a look at Charlie (with the UV camera), yeah, it'll clear it, but that's not any good, Houston.

<blockquote><i>[Readers should note that an azimuth of 134 would leave the camera pointing in the general direction of the LMP window on the north side of the LM, confirming our conjecture that, with regard to UV camera settings only, zero azimuth is west.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:56:01</b> England: Okay, Charlie.  What do you have? <p>

<b>125:56:05</b> Young: He has a water flag.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:56:20</b> England: (Giving John a new target)  Okay.  Azimuth is
258, elevation is 64.<p>

<b>125:56:29</b> Young: Okay.  I'm going to go to Reset again;  will that
be all right?<p>

<b>125:56:32</b> England: That's fine.<p>

<b>125:56:33</b> Young: Because I can't make it.  (Hearing Tony)  Okay,
Reset; Mark.  258, 64.<p>

<b>125:56:40</b> England: Rog.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>125:57:11</b> Duke: Man, that (UV camera) is some contraption, John.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>125:57:34</b> Young: 258 and 64, Houston.<p>

<b>125:57:37</b> England: Okay, fine.  We'd like you to get on in then.<p>

<b>125:57:42</b> Young: Okay.  That's not looking at anything that I
recognize.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[AZ258 and EL64 do not correspond to any of the targets
listed on the UV camera decal.  Because the lunar surface is so bright, he
is probably not able to see any stars and, therefore, would not be
commenting on his aim relative to the constellations.]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;There's something else
I don't really understand about the Far UV camera setup and the alignment
that we're doing in real time.  Except for the geo-corona and the Earth
(Target No. 2 on the decal), we changed every target in real time.  I don't
understand that.  After doing it (in training) for months, we changed every target in real time.  There were at least two targets that they called up and we got the alignment with the tough azimuth change (because of a sticking rotation mechanism) and they were pointed right at the Lunar Module.  And, you know, when I turned the thing around, I was taking a nice picture of Charlie looking out the window.  In my opinion, that's an inexcusable waste of time on the Moon - doing that kind of thing, but we did it anyway.  I just can't believe we're doing that.  There was one
setting, when we turned that son-of-a-gun around, and it wasn't even
clearing the ladder good.  I don't understand that.  I'll never understand
that; but that's what we did.  Golly!  Changed every setting after we
practiced these things for months and we specifically reviewed them.  When we started all this business back about a year ago, about one out of four would be pointing at the Lunar Module and we'd say 'go back and research this, as we don't want to be taking pictures of the Lunar Module, surely'.  So they had them all changed; and I figured that, before we launched, we had them all down in real time and, by golly, if we didn't change every target.  I can't imagine that 6 hours (landing delay) could do that to you.

It would (change the pointing a few degrees) on most targets, but I find it
hard to believe (that targets would have to be changed).  Plus, we had to move the camera after each EVA, and I don't understand that, either.  It was in the sunlight after the second sleep period.  The bottom half of that square box the spectroscope looks out of was in the sunlight and, after the second EVA, the upper three inches of the cassette handle was in the sunlight.  Of course, that could clobber your film because, if the heat goes down that cotton-picking barrel like it probably does - and heats up that film - that wipes you right out.  I don't understand that, either.  That would be a tragedy to lose that (experiment) for something like that.  But we may have.&quot;]<p>

[In fact, the film was not damaged and the experiment yielded useful
data.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Could you see stars out in the shadow?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  The only thing that was visible was the Sun and the Earth.  The UV camera was just looking up into the heavens all the time, to me; and I don't know what they were looking at.  We didn't take the time to dark adapt.&quot;]<p>

[A related question is whether or not stellar images could have been captured in any of the lunar surface photography.  All of the photos taken out on the surface were taken at an exposure of 1/250th of a second at f/8 or f/11.  The two film types were SO 368 Ektachrome MS color-reversal film ASA 64 and 2485 black and white film, ASA 6000.  Sky and Telescope Senior Editor Dennis di Cicco states, &quot;Sirius and a few other bright stars might actually be bright enough to have recorded on the exposures, but the images would be impossibly small and hard to find on the original negatives. Furthermore, when such a negative was printed to show the foreground properly, it certainly would not have shown the
star(s)&quot;  di Cicco notes that it would be easy to perform such an experiment on Earth.  &quot;Go out at night with a similar setup used for the lunar photos  and take a similar exposure of bright stars. Develop the film and see if you can find any star images. Then, have the negative printed with an exposure that would be proper for a normally exposed daylight negative. I am confident that you'll never, ever see a star on the print!&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:58:14</b> Young: Okay, Charlie.  Here I come.  Keep cool, man.<p>

<b>125:58:17</b> Duke: I'm fine.  Don't worry.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Although Charlie has gotten a warning tone indicating that he is just about out of cooling water, he will end the EVA with about a half pound left out of the original twelve pounds.  He is not working very hard at the moment and, if need be, could get hooked up to the LM system relatively quickly.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:58:29</b> Young: Agh.  (Pause)  Boy.  Up to the third rung, Charlie.<p>

<b>125:58:34</b> Duke: Beautiful<p>

<b>125:58:35</b> Young: Just like flying.<p>

<b>125:58:37</b> Duke: Put you on...The (Los Angeles) Lakers will want you when you get back.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The Los Angeles Lakers professional basketball team was a top-ranked team of the time.]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:58:46</b> Young: Here are those (containment) bags.<p>

<b>125:58:47</b> Duke: Okay.  Fine, I've got them.  Thank you.  Well, I thought I had them. (Garbled) a little bit.  I'm not closing you out, John. I'm just (pause) getting some bending room here.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is standing behind the hatch and John is still out on the porch.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;After you got everything in, you had to get over behind the hatch to let John in.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  And I was on the right (LMP) side at this point
and I swing the hatch open so that he could get in, and that trapped me
behind the hatch, and you couldn't bend down; and, at this point, John's
still shoving stuff in.  I think he's got some sort of bags.  I forgot what
it was - whether it was the ETB or whatever it is...But, anyway, something
that's coming in with him; and I couldn't reach down and get it with the
hatch fully open, so I had to open up so I could sort of lean over the
hatch a little bit and bend at the knees to get down.  And, when I did
that, I sort of closed the door.  John didn't mention anything but I just
said, you know, 'I'm not closing you out'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>125:59:28</b> Young: (Probably handing the bags in)  Okay, Charlie. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>125:59:36</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:59:46</b> Young: Here's the ETB.<p>

<b>125:59:47</b> Duke: Okay.  I'd get that (LEC) hook out of the way, if I
were you.  (Pause)<p>

<b>125:59:59</b> Young: Okay, hook is out of the way.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John has probably draped the LEC over the porch
railing.]</i></blockquote>

<b>126:00:10</b> Young: Do anything with that?<p>

<b>126:00:12</b> Duke: No, I think you can get in...Wait a minute; I can
get it here.  (Pause)  Okay, I got it.<p>

<b>126:00:20</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>126:00:24</b> Duke: Okay, enter your humble abode.  Okay, you really got to arch your back, John, (and get your stomach low so that the PLSS clears the bottom of the DSKY).  There you go; you got it.  Okay, come towards me a little bit.  Okay.  Keep coming towards me.  There you go.  Okay;  now bend over a little bit.  Come forward a little bit.  There you go; you got it.  Your tool harness is hooking up on your...There you go.  (Pause)<p>

<b>126:01:04</b> Young: (Phew), man!  (Pause)<p>

<b>126:01:11</b> Duke: Okay.  Now we're back inside (and ready to switch to Lunar Surface Checklist page 3-1).<p>

<b>126:01:15</b> Young: Why can't I turn around, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[After John crawled into the cabin and got his PLSS past the DSKY, he came upright on his knees, facing the left rear of the crew
area.]</i></blockquote>

<b>126:01:17</b> Duke: Huh?  Can't you go the other way?  Okay, you got it.<p>

<b>126:01:24</b> Young: Hung up on something.<p>

<b>126:01:25</b> Duke: Yeah, you're sitting on the hatch!<p>

<b>126:01:28</b> Young: Oh.<p>

<b>126:01:31</b> Duke: Don't want to close it (meaning the hatch) all the way and getting all this feedwater in here.  

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;The way I understand it is that the
sublimator wouldn't work if the hatch was closed.  On Apollo 12, Al Bean
accidentally swung the door closed and there was enough of a pressure
buildup from the water vapor coming off the sublimator that the sublimator quit working - although it certainly wasn't enough pressure to keep him from opening the hatch.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;The sublimator needed a vacuum.  We'd have to go on
through here and look at the checklist.  (Pause)  We had to close our water before we shut the hatch...It had something to do with the sublimator problem or, like I said here, getting the water condensing inside.  Anyway, the whole object was to close the primary H2O on the PLSS and then close and lock the hatch.  Both <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valves</a> in Auto, and then we'd hit cabin Repress, Auto.  Boy, you could hear it coming on, too, when that happened.   And I think we're going to comment about that later
on.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>126:01:34</b> Duke: Okay, now come around.  There you go.  Now we got it.  We're back inside.<p>

<b>126:01:41</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>126:01:42</b> Duke: Okay.  (Reading the top of the righthand column of <a href="a16EVA1Card2Side1.jpg" title="image" target="new">Card 2 Side 1</a>) We've got to close the (PLSS) Primary H2O.<p>

<b>126:01:47</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>126:01:48</b> Duke: If you'll turn...There you go.<p>

<b>126:01:52</b> Young: Get yours closed.  (Pause)<p>

<b>126:02:06</b> Duke: Okay (garbled).  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>126:02:27</b> Young: Can you swing your (back)pack this way just a little?

<blockquote><i>[The feedwater shut-off valve is one of the three valves on the lower right rear corner of the PLSS.  Charlie is probably turning to
his left to swing it around so John can reach it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>126:02:30</b> Duke: How's that?<p>

<b>126:02:34</b> Young: Okay, and your water valve is closed.<p>

<b>126:02:37</b> Duke: Okay.  And we can close the <a href="../forward_hatch.jpg" title="Frank O'Brien CAM photo" target="new">hatch</a>.  (Pause)  Okay, (overhead) <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a> going Auto.<p>

<b>126:02:47</b> Young: I haven't got the hatch closed, Charlie.<p>

<b>126:02:49</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[As he did during the Depress, Charlie is using the overhead valve and probably can't see what John is doing with the
hatch.  Charlie is left-handed, so it is relatively easy for him to reach up to get the valve, which is near the center of the ceiling.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1260252">126:02:52</a></b> Young: It's closed.<p>

<b>126:02:53</b> Duke: Okay; can you lock it?<p>

<b>126:02:56</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  Probably got to push it to lock it.  There you go.<p>

<b>126:03:04</b> Young: Damn it!  (Pause)  Ain't locking.  Why don't we wait until we get it pressurized.  It's closed good and tight.<p>

<b>126:03:19</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Once the cabin pressure goes above a few tenths of a psi, the hatch will seat itself.  After they depressurize the suits, they will be able to bend over much more easily to reach the latch.
