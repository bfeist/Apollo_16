<b>119:40:48</b> Young: Okay. &quot;Off-load and deploy the far UV&quot; (as per <a href="a16.lsp043.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-8</a>).  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John will aim the 
<a href="images16.html#KSC71P628" target="new">UV camera</a> at a variety of astronomical sources and take pictures on ultraviolet-sensitive film.  Because the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs UV radiation, observations can only be made above the atmosphere.  Early observations had been made with sounding rocket flight and, after its launch on 7 December 1968, the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory satellite was used to make extensive observations. The Apollo 16 camera provided coverage at shorter wavelengths than could be detected with the OAO, and, of course, could observe the whole Earth.]<p>

[A <a href="a16lbl17436.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> from AS16-107-<a href="images16.html#17436" target="new">17436</a>, a frame from a LM pan Charlie takes at the start of EVA-2, shows the empty Quad III Payload Pallet compartment where the UV camera is stowed. Quad III is on the northeast face of the spacecraft. The thermal blanket that covered the compartment hangs down from the bottom. As indicated on <a href="a16.lsp194.jpg" title="image" target="new">page 194</a> of the Final Lunar Surface Procedures document, the LRV Aft Pallet was stowed to the left of the Payload Pallet.]<p>

[Note that John is at 0+50 in his checklist.  The EVA started 47
minutes ago at  <a href="a16.eva1prep.html#1185333" target="new">118:53:33</a>.  At <a href="a16.eva1prelim.html#1191456" target="new">119:14:56</a>, just before John started the LRV deployment, he was about 8 minutes ahead of schedule and, since then, he has lost only about 5 minutes.  Compared with Apollo 15, the LRV deployment has gone quite smoothly.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:41:01</b> Young: You can definitely see where we kicked up some dirt.  Did you explain all these patterns to them, Charlie?<p>

<b>119:41:07</b> Duke: Yeah.  You might give a word.<p>

<b><a name="1194111">119:41:11</a></b> Young: Oh, I'm looking at a rock here that's got all kinds of dark clasts in it, and biggies (meaning large clasts) and that's got to be a breccia.  Too many different kinds (of clasts).  Yeah.  It is.

<blockquote><i>[Most of the rocks at the landing site are breccias, a type of rock made up of fragments of other rocks merged together by the high stresses that occur in an impact.  Because many in the geologic community were expecting to find various types of volcanics at Descartes, this is a significant observation early in the EVA.]<p>

[Muehlberger, from a 1996 e-mail message - &quot;John Young -
describing a rock near the LM as having dark clasts, that were biggies, and stating that it has 'got to be a breccia', as he was standing in front of it - should really have gotten our attention.  Again it was during a time that all of the conversation to this point had been concerned with powering down, getting into their suits, getting onto the lunar surface, and off-loading equipment, so it, too, could have gone on past our consciousness at that time. I hope that it didn't get by all of us that were involved!&quot;]<p>

<b>119:41:27</b> Duke: Hey, Tony.  Looking at Stone Mountain.  You see some lineations in it that are parallel to the local terrain - or to the normal surface - and they follow the contour lines.  And it looks to me it might be just some small ridges in it.  They're scattered about...(Pause)  I say they're &quot;scattered about&quot;, that (descriptor)'s not any good at all.  They look like (they are) a couple of meters wide or so, and the same distance...<p>

<b>119:42:05</b> Young: (Laughs)<p>

<b>119:42:06</b> Duke: ...and separation.  What is it, John?<p>

<b>119:42:13</b> Young: (Laughing)  Pulled the top out of the MESA blanket.<p>

<b>119:42:15</b> Duke: Oh.

<blockquote><i>[AS16-112-
<a href="images16.html#18217" target="new">18217</a> shows some of this structure near the Stone Mountain summit.]<p>

[John probably mis-spoke when he said &quot;MESA blanket&quot;.  He is probably removing a thermal cover from the <a href="a16lsp194.gif" title="image" target="new">Quad III</a> pallet that contains the UV camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:42:17</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  I'm about to deploy the old UV here.<p>

<b><a name="1194221">119:42:21</a></b> Duke: The guy that invented Velcro didn't know his own strength!  (Straining) I got to get this blanket back.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is on <a href="a16.lmpev107.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-7</a>.  He has
put the Hasselblad camera in the Rover floor pan and is now removing the <a href="../alsj-LCRU.html" target="new">LCRU</a> (Lunar Communications Relay Unit) from the MESA.  He is having trouble
moving the thermal blankets.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:42:31</b> Young: Okay, Houston, I'm going back to midway between Intermediate and Minimum.  I was in Minimum when I was driving the old Rover, and it seemed to be pretty good.<p>

<b>119:42:45</b> Duke: (Proud of himself)  Look at that LCRU come out of here!  Hah!   No struggle.  (Long Pause)  Now, I can't bend the suit.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As per 
<a href="a16.lmpev107.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-7</a>, Charlie has probably carried the LCRU over to the Rover and is trying to get low enough to mount it on the front of the Rover.  See Figure 
<a href="../lrvf2-13.jpg" title="image" target="new">2-13</a> from the 
<a href="../lrvhand.html" target="new">LRV Operations Handbook</a>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;After you get the LCRU out of the MESA, you install it
on the front of the LRV.  And that must have been fairly low.  Would that have been a problem getting down to get it into position?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, I think so.  Uh-huh, to bend down at the
knees.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you have to use two hands on the LCRU?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I think so.&quot;]<p>

[There is good video coverage of the LCRU installation on Apollo
15.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1194315">119:43:15</a></b> Young: Hah!  Look at that (protective) bag tear away.  Outstanding!  Thought I wouldn't be able to do that one.  Okay, the UV camera is sitting (properly) in the <a href="a16lsp194.gif" title="image" target="new">Quad III</a> pallet, and it looks normal in
every respect to me.  Let's see if we can get it out of there.  (Long
Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;If I remember, he had trouble reaching back into there.  And he was thinking he was going to have a tough time reaching in and getting that...There was a covering over the UV camera, and that's why he was so excited, because it came out with no problem at all.  There is a problem, I think.  You've got to be very careful that you try to cinch things down and Velcro things down in one g and then, you get up on the Moon and you might have to reach just a little bit farther and you try to pull things away and pull the Velcro off...And that Velcro was very, very strong.  You know, an inch-wide strip of Velcro that's maybe six (or) seven inches long - and it's fresh - is really difficult to pull.  That's why we said earlier we could pull - just trying to get the Velcro off the Rover seats, we could pick up the whole vehicle!&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:44:01</b> Young: Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Look at that, Charlie!!<p>

<b>119:44:10</b> Duke: You got it!<p>

<b>119:44:11</b> Young: Look at me carry it!  I'm carrying it over my shoulder!!!  Ha ha ha!  I guess we don't have to worry about dust getting on it.  Boy, one-sixth g is the neatest environment you can find for this kind of work.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[In person, John Young is a slight, quiet, reserved man who rarely makes eye contact.  The exuberance he shows here makes a stunning contrast.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;John was ecstatic with the one-sixth gravity.  You know, in the training, even the lightweight stuff we had was difficult to horse around - these experiments and the UV camera and all that stuff - and, up there, like he said, he could just throw it over his shoulder.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Okay, the far-UV
camera.  I didn't have any problem with off-loading it.  I expected trouble from the bags.  It came loose and I expected trouble picking the thing up and getting it off and I expected problems with keeping it out of the dust. I was able to get around the front of the vehicle (meaning the west side of the LM) and hold it over my head.  It was easy to carry that weight around.&quot;]<p>

[John was probably able to flex his suit more than any of the other
astronauts.  Few would have been able to carry anything above shoulder
height because of restricted arm movement.  Unfortunately, we have no TV of John performing this feat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:44:43</b> Young: Okay, Charlie.  I'm gonna put it over here by the
strut, just like it shows on my picture there.  Maybe right even with
bottom strut.<p>

<b>119:45:00</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[The diagram on <a href="a16.lsp045.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-9</a> shows that John is to place the UV
camera 15 feet from the LM in the spacecraft shadow.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:45:01</b> Young: We'll just have to watch where we throw things. 
(Pause)  Ohh! Ohh! Ohh, is that nice!  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1194532">119:45:32</a></b> Duke: (Straining)  Astromate connectors.  I'm an astro-matey.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Astromate connectors?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was a push-and-turn type deal.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was it a multiple pin-type connector?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, it was; but they had alignment marks.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;Everything went well on the LRV load-up until I tried to get the power connector on from the LRV to the LCRU.  The flight gear is really stiff and the cable had a set in it and it was just tough for me to get that Astromate connector on.  It took a lot longer than in training, but it finally locked in and that was really the only problem I had on the front end of the load-up.&quot;]<p>

[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The cables were what was stiff.&quot;]<p>

[Duke, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;You'd get the connector aligned and, to see where you were aligned, you had to put it in place and get over to the side; and, when I'd do that, the cable would spring out again.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:46:04</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  All three wheels (meaning legs) are down and locked on the camera.<p>

<b>119:46:14</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Here, John is using &quot;wheels&quot; in the aircraft
sense of landing gear.  There aren't any wheels on the bottom of the UV
camera legs since small wheels would serve no purpose in the soft lunar
surface.  See <a href="a16.lsp199.jpg" title="image" target="new">figure 3.4-4</a> in the Lunar Surface Procedures
volume.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:46:19</b> Young: Charlie?<p>

<b>119:46:20</b> Duke: What?<p>

<b>119:46:21</b> Young: Do you know where I'm gonna have to put this
contraption?<p>

<b>119:46:23</b> Duke: Where?<p>

<b>119:46:24</b> Young: Right here.  According to my picture.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The place that we had to mount it in the shadow was in a small, subdued crater with about a 3- to 4-degree slope, and probably it was more than that.  The only way I could get the camera level was to really step down on two of the legs, push them clean down out of sight in the dirt, with the other leg sitting right on the surface.  And that was the first problem I had with
it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:46:33</b> Young: Okay, now, Tony, if I set it parallel to the (edge
of the LM) shadow, is that due west?<p>

<b>119:46:36</b> England: That's close enough to due west.  It'll be about 3 degrees off.<p>

<b>119:46:43</b> Young: Well, I can set it 3 degrees some way or
another.<p>

<b>119:46:47</b> England: Okay, bias it north slightly.<p>

<b><a name="1194652">119:46:52</a></b> Young: Okay.  A little north bias.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As indicated in <a href="a16.lsp006.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 2.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface
Procedures volume, the Sun is slightly north of east.  The time is
currently about 1741 GMT on April 21, 1972.  From the chart, the sun is
about 6 degrees north of east.  The LM shadow is tapered and that might
explain Tony's estimate of a 3-degree bias.]<p>

[In addition to the task list on <a href="a16.lsp045.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-10</a>, John has a &quot;cronopaque&quot; sheet with detailed procedures printed on one side and a target list on the other.  See Figure <a href="a16.lsp448.jpg" title="image" target="new">5.3-1</a> from the 
<a href="a16.lsp.html" target="new">Lunar Surface Procedures</a> volume.  Cronopaque is a photographic paper and, according to
the Lunar Surface Procedures volume, this set of instructions is
&quot;attached to the Far UV Camera by a Velcro strap&quot;.  The list is the square object at the upper left corner of the camera in AS16-114-
<a href="images16.html#18439" target="new">18439</a>.  Markus Mehring has produced a 
<a href="a16.uvcamdet.jpg" title="image" target="new">detail</a> showing the list.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:47:04</b> Duke: (Breathing hard)  Well, Tony, I tell you one thing,
that's the hardest job on there, getting that crummy connector on there. 
Whew.  (Pause)  Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;It wasn't going too well, I remember.  If I
remember, you had to push it and lock it; and it was difficult to get
enough strength (means leverage) to push it in and overcome the tension in the thing to lock it.  I remember we worked hard on that.&quot;]
</i></blockquote>

<b>119:47:36</b> Young: Okay, Houston, the (UV camera) battery temperature is reading 100 degrees F, which it was reading before...That's the one the other one always reads.<p>

<b>119:47:45</b> England: Okay, that sounds good.

<blockquote><i>[John is looking at a patch called a tempa-label with a series of spots which change from white to black successively higher temperatures.  A detail from Apollo 16 training photo <a href="a16tempalabel.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-71P-111</a> shows a tempa-label on the handle of a UHT.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;If I remember, they started about 100 degrees and went
up every 50 degrees.  There was a little patch that would turn black  when
the temperature got to that limit.  So it was like 100, 150, 200, 250.  And then I think it might have even had a 300 on it.  That was one thing I
thought we always should have had, was a thermometer up there on the
surface.  And Apollo never had a thermometer on the lunar surface; just had these little decals.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:47:47</b> Young: And I'm setting the battery out.  The battery is
going out in the Sun (as per <a href="a16.lsp045.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-10</a>) with the temperature plate up.  No,
it's down.  (Pause)  Now it's up.  (Pause)  Too far.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Young, from the 1972 Technical Debrief - &quot;The second problem (with the UV camera), which was a continual one, was the battery cable.  Even though I didn't deploy the battery too far out in the
sunshine, the battery cable had a mind of its own and insisted on staying
about 4 inches off the ground around the camera where I was walking, even though I pulled the whole thing back in there.  So, every time I walked
around the camera, I had to pick my feet up to avoid the battery cable; and 2 or 3 times I tripped over it but, fortunately, it was the battery that
moved and not the camera.&quot;]<p>

[John can be seen stepping over the battery cable in training photo
<a href="images16.html#KSC71P628" target="new">KSC-71P-628</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>119:48:39</b> England: And, John, when you get to the first setting,
I've some new settings for you.<p>

<b>119:48:46</b> Young: I thought you might have, Tony.

<blockquote><i>[They had planned to start the first EVA at 102:25 and to reach this point in the timeline at about 103:25.  The 16-hour difference would create a pointing difference of about 8 degrees for all targets other than Earth.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:48:48</b> Young: Okay.  (Reading) &quot;Deploy legs, point camera down-Sun, embed, stabilize, remove battery pins, azimuth pin.&quot;  Okay.  &quot;Plate pin.&quot;  Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:49:20</b> Duke: Hey, Tony, now that we got this little beauty
(meaning the suit) pressurized, the suit just feels perfect.<p>

<b>119:49:27</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>119:49:29</b> Young: Pull the...<p>

<b>119:49:30</b> England: Shall we give credits to the tailor?<p>

<b>119:49:35</b> Young: ...plate pin.  (Pause)<p>

<b>119:49:41</b> Duke: I'll give credit to Clyde and Troy and those guys
and everybody who helped me get it fitted right.<p>

<b>119:49:47</b> England: Right.<p>

<b><a name="1194948">119:49:48</a></b> Duke: It was a little doubtful there the first time in the LM, but...(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;Clyde and Troy were our suit technicians. 
<a href="../a11/ap11-KSC-69PC-376.jpg" title="image" target="new">Troy Stewart</a> (shown with Neil Armstrong and Deke Slayton) was an Air Force Sergeant.  <a href="a16-teague.jpg" title=Image" target="new">Clyde Teague</a> (shown with Wally Schirra in September 1968) was retired military but was working at NASA.  I don't now about Clyde, but Troy's still around, I think.  And they were suit techs, working in Crew Systems Division.  They were with us the whole flight.  They got everything fitted and they took care of our suits - the flight suits and the training suits.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;One of the things I've discussed with Jack a bit is: at
what point does a full-time suit tech becomes necessary at a lunar base?  One of the questions is: How many 8-hour EVAs do you think you could have gotten out of the EMUs before you really had a problem, even with the maximum maintenance you could do with more elbow room - say a suit prep room or something like that.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;To me, the suit probably wasn't going to be the limiting
factor.  It was going to be the PLSS, probably, because it had all the
mechanical components.  The suit was basically solid; and I felt that if
you kept it clean - all the connectors and seals and stuff like that -
after every EVA, like we tried to do - it was going to work.  It wasn't going to get sticky and the seals wouldn't be abraded and start leaking.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Could you have gone ten EVAs?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It's hard to say.  Even though the suits look ratty on
the outside - you know, they were covered with dust and they'd turned gray - the integrity of the suit was still solid.  You know, we pressurized that suit four times:  three on the Moon and one coming back (for Ken Mattingly's EVA).  I think, with a good maintenance schedule, you'd have been alright for ten EVAs, probably.  I'm not sure you need a full-time suit tech.  I think you could train on your suit to do some preventive maintenance and learn how to replace laces and stuff like that.  And we had done that a little bit.  On the way out, my suit didn't fit.  I felt like I had gotten it too short in the torso.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;You could let out the legs.  The legs had these laces and you could undo the laces and sort of work it around and it would extend the leg; and I was about ready to do that.  I felt like I could do that.  I had seen the suit techs do it; but they (meaning Houston) nixed it.  They didn't want me to do that, in case I screwed it up.  But with just a few more hours of preliminary training on cleaning seals and making sure the laces are right and preliminary inspections, I think a guy could maintain his own suit.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;Now, I'm not so sure about a backpack, of course.  If you've
got a mechanical problem, if a pump goes out or a cooling loop or you get a little leak here or there, then you're going to need somebody that's technically qualified to deal with it.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It's going to be an issue when you start talking about people spending six months at a lunar base or, for some of the extended Mars missions where they're talking about six month to one-year stays.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I wouldn't waste a spot (that is, a crew position) with
just a suit tech.  If you're going to have a guy who's technical, you need somebody who can be an expert on the environmental control systems and the suits and the Rover and whatever you're going to have up there.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;A general Mr. Fix-it.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Somebody that was well-trained in
everything.  That's going to be interesting - the crew make up.  A lot of thought should be given to that.&quot;]<p>

[I had a delightful conversation with Troy Stewart on Jan. 18, 1996. 
He said that the cover layers on the training suits got shredded from working on the sand at the Cape.  On one occasion, he made a pink, heart-shape patch to cover a rip on the seat of Charlie's training suit.]<p>

[Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that training photo <a href="images16.html#KSC72PC154" target="new">KSC-72PC-154</a> shows Charlie sporting blue, heart-shaped patches on his right thigh and right sleeve.]<p>

[Troy mentioned that the Beta cloth was also subject to abrasion, particularly in places where it was ground between the PLSS and hard features inside the suit.  Later, the Beta cloth was replaced with a Teflon-coated Beta, which had better wear properties.  They did periodic maintenance on the training suits, roughly once every 25 use-hours unless something particular came up.  The rings and seals were cleaned and lubricated daily.  He did not look at the flight suits in detail after the missions but noted that they all looked like they had been sprayed with graphite powder.]<p>

[Troy worked on Apollo 11, 13, 16, and 17.  He also said that, during
the stand-down after the Challenger accident, he was a suit subject during
some development work on an 8-psi hardsuit for the Space Station.  He said that the hardsuit is easier to manipulate at 8-psi than the 4-psi soft suit - except for the hands, which are about the same on the two
suits.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:49:59</b> Young: Well, your magnet still works, Houston.<p>

<b>119:50:03</b> England: (Laughs) Now we got a data point; magnets work on the Moon.

<blockquote><i>[In a 1996 exchange of e-mail, Tony England suggested that the magnet in question is the magnet inside the camera used to focus the electrons produced by the UV radiation on a photocathode.  See Figure <a href="a16psrf13-2.jpg" title="image" target="new">13-2</a> in the <a href="a16psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>.  Evidently, something on John's suit was attracted by the magnet as it had been in training.  Possibilities include his watch and pressure gauge.  His wristrings are made of aluminum and would not be attracted.]</i></blockquote>

<b>119:50:15</b> Duke: Okay, where we are (at the bottom of 
<a href="a16.lmpev107.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-7</a>):  the low gain antenna is coming in on my checklist, Tony.<p>

<b>119:50:22</b> Young: Charlie, I forgot to put in the Aux circuit
breakers over there (on the LRV console).  Push it in.<p>

<b>119:50:26</b> Duke: Aux circuit breaker going in.<p>

<b>119:50:28</b> Young: Okay.  That'll save us some trouble.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has installed the LCRU and the <a href="../alsj-GCTA.html" target="new">TCU</a> (Television
Control Unit) on the front of the Rover and, next, will install the
low-gain antenna on the top of John's inboard handhold.  The low-gain only
has to be pointed to within about 30 degrees of Earth and, because the
Earth is nearly overhead, John will not have to change the aiming as he
drives. Figure <a href="../lrvf2-13.jpg" title="image" target="new">2-13</a> in the 
<a href="../lrvhand.html" target="new">LRV Operations Handbook</a> shows the installation

sections of the deep core.  Because of a design error, the Apollo 15 vise
was mounted backwards and was all but useless to Scott and Irwin.  Needless to say, that error was corrected for Apollo 16.]</i></blockquote>

here comes the big eye, the 500.

<blockquote><i>[The Sun compass is a cardboard site map with a raisable
gnomon that could be used as a navigation aid in the event on a Rover
navigation failure.  The gnomon is used to orient the map relative to the
Sun.  The only time this type of Sun compass was used during Apollo was
when Dave used one during the Apollo 15 Stand-up EVA.  He used it to get
rough bearings to prominent horizon features in an effort to pin down the
LM location.  The inherent errors of a few hundred meters were too great to do much good in that regard.]<p>

[As Fendell continues his pan, there are noticeable effects of the
changing sun angle.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;As you look down-Sun it was very, very bright.  And as
you turned, either north or south, and looking cross-Sun, it (meaning the
surface) got progressively darker and darker and you started seeing the
shadows.  And then, when you looked up-Sun, it was very dark.  You were
looking at the shadowed side of the rock and the soils and the dust grains,
I guess, because the albedo (reflectivity) change just got really
pronounced as you moved around.  You see that happening here.  He's panning to the north, here.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:14:07</b> Young: Old Fredo (Haise) is to be congratulated for

<b>120:14:14</b> Young: Darn right.  That's good stuff.  Save us a lot of
work later on.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The rake was the brainchild of Caltech geologist <a href="../lee_silver.html" target="new">Lee Silver</a>
and was first flown on Apollo 15.  It is rather like a clam rake and is
used to collect rocks of more than a centimeter in size.  The rake is
attached to an extension handle and, on Apollo 15, Scott and Irwin only had one extension handle.  Consequently, when they wanted to use the rake, they had to remove the scoop head that was usually on the handle and attach the  rake.  Fred Haise, the Apollo 13 LMP and the Apollo 16 backup Commander, may have come up with the idea of having two extension handles.]<p>

[Fendell reverses direction and we see Charlie get a holder for the
traverse maps.]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:14:31</b> Young: Okay, that's about the size of it.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie attaches the map holder to his handhold and then
picks up a couple of traverse maps.  Each map is a laminated sandwich of two piece of stiff cronopaque, photographic paper with a labeled picture of a part of the site on one side and a contour map of the same area on the other.  <a href="images16.html#lsp263" target="new">Figure 3.6.2-2</a>) is the contour map for EVAs 1 and 2 and Figure
<a href="a16.lsp264.jpg" title="image" target="new">3.6.2-3</a> is the corresponding picture map.  Each of the maps is about 8 by
10 1/2 inches - 20 by 27 cm.]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:14:34</b> Duke: Ah, the old maps!  Which old map do you want to look at, John?  Hmm.  Just like training.  Good picture of Hadley Rille (the Apollo 15 site).  (Pause)  I'm just teasing, Houston.

<blockquote><i>[Maps of Hadley Rille, such as the one shown mounted next to the console on the Apollo 15 Rover in a detail from AS15-85-11471 ( <a href="../a15/a15det11471.jpg" title="image" target="new">169k</a> ), are unmistakable.  Charlie is joking.  The maps he has show the Apollo 16 site.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;We never had the right ones in training!  You know, the
maps they gave us were not...They just threw anything out there.  So we never had the right ones.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:14:50</b> Young: Looks like we're down some, I guess, on the timeline already.

<blockquote><i>[According to <a href="a16.lmpev110.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-10</a>, Charlie is supposed to get a pallet out of the MESA containing replacement batteries, food, etc. and take it up to the cabin.  After stowing the items taken off the pallet, he would then power down some of the LM comm circuitry that is no longer needed now that the LCRU is up and running.  However, in a moment Houston will tell him to defer the pallet transfer until the end of the EVA because the LM comm system is already operating at minimum power as part of the conservation measures dictated by the delayed landing.]<p>

[During the following conversation, Charlie mounts the BSLSS behind
his seat, attaching it with a Velcro strap.]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:15:21</b> Duke: I've got to get the pallet out.<p>

Okay, the SRC's next.  John, why don't you unpack the SRC (as per the

<b>120:16:13</b> Young: There's nothing up there?<p>

<b>120:16:14</b> Duke: Well, the only reason we had to go in there was to change to power down, see.<p>

<blockquote><i>[They had planned to deploy the TV camera on a tripod before deploying the Rover but, because of the need to conserve LM power, skipped those procedures on <a href="a16.lsp041.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-5</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:17:29</b> Duke: (Joining John at the MESA)  Okay;  I'm gonna
close...<p>

<b>120:17:31</b> Young: There goes that shield thing that came off.<p>

<b>120:17:34</b> Duke: What shield thing?<p>

<b>120:17:35</b> Young: That thing down there.<p>

<b>120:17:37</b> Duke: That's okay.<p>

<b>120:17:41</b> Young: (Garbled)  Make it hard to close the box later on.

<blockquote><i>[The vacuum sealing mechanism on the rock box consists of a knife-edge on the rim of the body and a strip of soft-indium metal on the rim of the lid.  When the box is closed, the knife-edge sinks into the indium strip and makes the seal.  In addition to these features, there are also o-rings.  To keep the knife-edge from making contact with the indium strip during the flight out from Earth, the two are kept separate by a close-fitting spacer made of hard Teflon.  In addition, to keep the sealing
edges clean while John and Charlie put samples in the box, they cover the rim of both the body and the lid with a piece of Beta cloth which has a cut-out to give access to the box cavity.  Evidently, John has knocked the Teflon spacer off the box he is preparing on the MESA.  My only doubt about this hypothesis is John's anticipation of later difficulties in closing the box.  Perhaps he is worried that its loss will increase the chances of damage to the sealing mechanism.  NASA photo S70-29817 is a pre-flight
picture of an Apollo 14 rock box with the Teflon spacer surrounding the knife-edge.  NASA photo S88-52674 shows a rock box with a beta cloth cover protecting the knife-edge and indium strip.]<p>

[John takes a sample collection bag (SCB) to the Rover.  He will
attach it to the Hand Tool Carrier (HTC) which is on the aft pallet.  NASA

<b>120:17:45</b> Duke: Guess what?<p>

<b>120:17:46</b> Young: What, Charlie?<p>

<b><a name="1201748">120:17:48</a></b> Duke: I can't reach.  There we go.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie flexes his knees and jumps up onto the MESA.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I was leaning on the MESA and I just kicked up so I
could get back in there and reach a piece of gear (the TV sunshield) that I
was pulling out.  When I got up, I just sort of rested on my stomach, as I
reached back over in there to get the thing.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:17:55</b> Duke: Look at me, John.<p>

<b>120:17:57</b> Young: Yeah?<p>

<b>120:17:58</b> Duke: Look at that.  I just pole-vaulted up into the MESA to get that beauty.

<blockquote><i>[Before he gets down, Charlie bends his knees almost to 90 degrees.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That was to get back down.  That was to give you a
little elevation.  I kicked 'em and then pushed...&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;To get back off.  So you really could flex that knee a
fair amount.  They came back about 90 degrees.&quot;]<p>

[I was thinking about the difficulty Charlie had with kneeling to pick
things up off the ground.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;The reason you couldn't bend down and do like a deep
knee bend was because of balance.  If you were leaning on something, you
had a better chance of doing it.  But you get down and, to me, I was always
off balance and either fall down or it'd hop you back up, or you'd run
across...As you popped up, it'd throw you forward a little bit, so you'd
have to run to catch up...for your feet to catch up with you.&quot;]<p>

[Indeed, a re-examination of the TV here shows that while Charlie did
flex his knees virtually to 90 degrees, he didn't hold them in the bent
position for any time at all.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;But, if you'd been next to the Rover, you think you
could have just gotten down on your knees?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah.  In fact, John does it later on, around the
ALSEP.&quot;]<p>

[Charlie's knee flex doesn't appear to help him get off the MESA and,
a second later, he pushes himself off with his hands.]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:18:09</b> Young: Charlie, what do I do with the SRC?  You've got
that piece of paper on you.<p>

<b>120:18:13</b> Duke: Okay, the SRC; it just says (reading <a href="a16.lmpev110.gif" title="image" target="new">LMP-10</a>) &quot;Seal control sample.  SCB to left-hand tool carry.&quot;<p>

<blockquote><i>[Charlie grabs the MESA with his left hand and drops to his knees, illustrating the point discussed above.  He has to lean forward to get the sunshield and, as he rises, he hops forward, out of the TV
field-of-view, to get his feet under his center of gravity.  Note the ETB
swinging on the front of the MESA.]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:19:21</b> Duke: Got to keep those MESA blankets on this left side closed.  The Sun's on that side of the MESA.

<b>120:19:29</b> Young: Hey, you gonna deploy that thing? <p>

<b>120:19:31</b> Duke: What thing?<p>

<b>120:19:32</b> Young: That critter.<p>

<b>120:19:33</b> Duke: I'm gonna get the control sample here.<p>

<b>120:19:34</b> Young: Okay, I'll get the (U.S.) flag (out of the MESA).

<blockquote><i>[The control sample is a roll of clean aluminum metal which Charlie has just put in an individual sample bag.]</i></blockquote>

<b>120:19:35</b> Duke: Okay.  And it works.  You can spin it (meaning an
individual sample bag) right up, John.  Just like we started doing in
training.

<blockquote><i>[As can be seen in the three figures on page 55 of Judy
Allton's &quot;Catalog of Apollo Lunar Surface Geological Sampling Tools
and Containers&quot;, the sample bags had a thin metal re-enforcing strip
running along the top edges and, at either side, metal tabs.  The
astronauts used two methods to seal the bags.  Most folded the top of the bag down a few times and then bent one of the tabs across one face of the folded bag and then the other tab across the opposite face, creating a &quot;Z&quot; pattern.  The other method, which Charlie employs here, is to grasp both tabs and spin the bag several times around the axis formed by the re-enforcing wire before finally &quot;Z-ing&quot; the tabs.  NASA photo S72-36984 is a post-flight picture of one of the Apollo 16 rock boxes and shows several spun bags.  The Z-pattern of closure is evident on the bag at the right side of the picture.]<p>

<b>120:19:45</b> Duke: Okay, while you're getting the flag, I'll go open the ALSEP door.<p>

<b>120:19:49</b> Young: Okay.
