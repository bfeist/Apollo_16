<blockquote><i>[While John aligns the high-gain antenna, Charlie is probably scanning the Contact Surface Sample page in his cuff checklist,
<a href="a16eva2LMP-16.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-16</a>, and the facing Station 9 page, <a href="a16eva2LMP-17.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-17</a>.  Note that Station 9 is called the &quot;Vacant Lot&quot;, and is supposed to be a site relatively free of South Ray ejecta.  They plan to spend 25 minutes here.]<p>

<b>147:55:57</b> Young: Good show.  Getting pretty good at getting the old Earth in there.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The TV camera is pointing ENE.  Note the foreground Rover tracks and the dip they reveal.  Without the tracks in the picture, the dip would be all but invisible.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:56:14</b> Duke: Tony, I bet you that Rover would have climbed to the top of Stone...Right on up.<p>

<b>147:56:23</b> Young: Sure it would.<p>

<b><a name="1475635">147:56:35</a></b> England: (Making a mis-identification) Say again, Charlie.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Tony was listening to a conversation about proposed changes in the Rover switch configuration and missed John's question.  Without waiting for an answer, John comes around and uses the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">large dustbrush</a> to clean the TV lens.  After John finishes, <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> starts a clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1475645">147:56:45</a></b> Duke: Okay, pan is complete.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's <a href="a16pan1475645.jpg" title="image" target="new">Station 9 pan</a> consists of frames AS16-108-<a href="images16.html#17714" target="new">17714</a> to

[The hammer in John's <a href="A16ShinPocket.html" target="new">shin pocket</a> is visible in 
<a href="images16.html#17731" target="new">17731</a>.]<p>

[The <a href="a16.sta9tracks.jpg" title="image" target="new">inbound Rover tracks</a> can be seen in the souhtern portion of the pan.  As can be seen in AS16-108-
<a href="images16.html#17737" target="new">17737</a>, John appears to have driven into the area of Station 9 from the SSE, passing west of Charlie's position, turned right and drove in a clockwise circle  through about 180 degree until, as can be seen in <a href="images16.html#17733" target="new">17733</a>, he made a left-hand turn and drove outside his first set of tracks in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise) until he was up-Sun of his final parking spot where, as can be seen in 
<a href="images16.html#17728" target="new">17728</a>, he turned left again to a westerly heading and, finally, turned left to park on a southerly heading.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1475647">147:56:47</a></b> Duke: (Looking at 
<a href="a16eva2LMP-17.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-17</a>)  Okay, we need the surface samples.  (Looking at <a href="a16eva2LMP-16.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-16</a>) And that starts with the Beta and then the Velvet.  And then a skim and a scoop!

<blockquote><i>[They are about to do some special soil sampling.  As shown in the sketch on <a href="a16.lsp112.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-16</a>, they will select a large rock and will do the sampling on the southwest side of the rock, away from the LM and the Rover.  As indicated on page <a href="a16.lsp185.jpg" title="image" target="new">185</a> in the Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, they want to collect samples of pristine surface materials and three potential types of contamination of the sampling site are the LM Descent Engine exhaust, water vapor given off by the PLSSs as John and Charlie work around the Rover, material John might kick onto the sample site as he approaches.  These three types of contamination can be minimized by collecting the sample at a considerable distance from the LM (more than one kilometer was suggested by the PI); parking the Rover on the LM-ward side of a rock; approaching the rock carefully to avoid kicking soil over the rock; and, finally, reaching over the rock and collecting the samples on the far side.  As suggested by the dialog over the next several minutes, there were also concerns about contaminating the business end of the sampling tool with either dust coming off the suits as John and Charlie moved around and by the water vapor exhaust of the PLSSs.  Both sources could be avoided by not pointing the business end at either suit.]<p>

[The 'Surface Samples' will be collected with a tool called the Contact Soil Sampling device, which is shown in Figure 
<a href="../tools/judy01.jpg" title="image" target="new">1</a> in Judy Allton's 
<a href="../tools/Welcome.html" target="new">Tool Book</a>.  The sampler head consists of two halves connected by a hinge, rather like the covers of a hardback book.  As shown at the upper left of the figure, a handle is attached to what we might think of as the front cover.  Once John is in position next to the rock, he will open the back cover and secure it to the handle with a strip of Velcro.  This exposes the inside of the front cover, which is covered with a sample pad made of so-called &quot;Beta cloth&quot;, which is woven from a Teflon-coated yarn.  John will then reach across the rock and press the Beta-cloth pad on the surface and, in principle, will lift off particles making up the upper 100 micrometers of the surface.  John will then close the Beta-cloth sampler, secure it with the Velcro strap - as shown in Figure 
<a href="../tools/judy02.jpg" title="image" target="new">2</a> - and replace it with a sampler containing a pad made of white-nylon velvet.  He will then reach over the rock a second time and press that sampler on a fresh spot and, in principle, will collect particles making up the top 1
mm of the surface.  Training photo 
<a href="ap16-KSC-72PC-141.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-72PC-141</a> shows John practicing with the Contact Soil Sampler at the Cape.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1475704">147:57:04</a></b> Young: Okay, that rock over there, the one I'm gonna sneak up on, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[John crosses the TV picture from right to left, going to
the CDR seat.]<p>

[John will approach the rock very slowly to avoid
kicking soil on the sampling area on the far side of the rock.  During training, this became known as &quot;sneaking up on a rock.&quot;  Training photo <a href="ap16-KSC-72PC-140.jpg" title="image" target="new">KSC-72PC-140</a> shows John has he reaches over a boulder at the Cape so he can press the sampler on the surface.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I take it that you guys had an awful lot of fun with
this in training.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah.  It was the biggest joke.  (Laughing)  We were
just going to sneak up on that rock, you know.  They wanted
</i>absolutely<i> undisturbed surface, you see, so we were supposed to
tippy-toe...When they first told us that, we just started giggling, so we
made it into a joke where we were going to tippy-toe...So, in practice, we
did like the Keystone Kops - you know, you sneak, sneak, in silent movies
you always knew you were sneaking because you could watch...&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Up on your toes...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  That's what we did in training.  And the whole
purpose was to reach over this rock so, as we walked up, we didn't kick
dust on to the sample; so, by reaching over the rock - if we had walked up
and kicked, the rock would have stopped it and we still would have had a
pristine sample out there.  And, so, to make sure we weren't kicking up any
dust, we were going to sneak up on it, you see.  So we just had a big kick
out of it during training, so this was our sneak maneuver.  And it was just
a lot of fun.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Well, let me tell you, the first time I heard this tape
- or the first time I read this stuff - I had absolutely no idea what was
going on.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:57:07</b> Duke:  Yeah. (Reading to 
<a href="a16eva2LMP-16.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-16</a>) &quot;After (sample) 2 (which is the velvet pad), place gnomon.&quot;  We don't have that (because the gnomon is broken).  &quot;Cross-Sun stereo 'after';  down-Sun, locator. Do skim (at spot) 3.&quot;  Okay, so we don't get any pictures until we get the first two (pad samples).<p>

<b>147:57:20</b> Young: Well, you got the pan.<p>

<b>147:57:24</b> England: Okay.  And before you leave the Rover, we'd like you to pull the Batt 2 Bus D circuit breaker.  We'll let you put it back in
before you drive off.<p>

<b><a name="1475731">147:57:31</a></b> Young: Batt 2, Bus B circuit
breaker.  Rog.  (Pause)  That's out.<p>

<b>147:57:41</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[It is not clear whether John said &quot;Bus B&quot; or &quot;Bus D&quot;.  Someone in Houston thinks he heard John say &quot;Bus B&quot; and tries to call attention to the fact but, for the moment, is ignored.  In Figure <a href="../lrvf1-22.jpg" title="image" target="new">1-22</a> in the 
<a href="../lrvhand.html" target="new">LRV Operations Handbook</a>, the circuit breakers on the left side under the heading indicator and Batt 2 has breakers only for Bus
C and Bus D, making it likely that John actually pulled the Bus D breaker,
a supposition which is confirmed at 
<a href="#1482859" target="new">148:28:59</a>.  Tony should have said &quot;Dog&quot; to avoid confusion, and John should have called him on it.  Note, that just before John drives away from Station 9 at 
<a href="#1482811" target="new">148:28:11</a>, Houston has him switch all the steering and the rear drive power to Bus B and, on that occasion, Tony uses proper procedure and refers to it as &quot;Bus Baker&quot;.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:57:46</b> Duke: And, Tony, a comment on this pallet (probably
referring to the tool gate at the back of the Rover).  The locking on the
tool harness (means &quot;tool carrier&quot;)...The locking ring on the
pallet doesn't stay up every time.  It's slightly inconvenient, but no big
deal.<p>

<b>147:58:00</b> Young: What are you getting, Charlie?<p>

<b>147:58:01</b> England: (Responding to Charlie) Okay, understand.<p>

<b>147:58:02</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>147:58:03</b> Duke: I'm going to get a shovel for the scoop (sample). 
And I thought we'd maybe...And I'll tell you what I got to do is fix up
a...Start on a double (means &quot;single&quot;) core for the CSVC. 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The Core Sample Vacuum Container is shown in Figure 
<a href="../tools/judy76.gif" title="image" target="new">76</a> in Judy Allton's 
<a href="../tools/Welcome.html" target="new">Tool Book</a>.  It is 41 cm long and will hold a single drive tube.  The CSVC task is listed on  <a href="a16eva2LMP-17.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-17</a>.  Charlie has made several verbal errors during the last few minutes, a possible indicator of
fatigue.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:58:24</b> Young: Okay; well, let me get these (pad) samples out of the way...<p>

<b>147:58:26</b> Duke: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<p>

<b>147:58:26</b> Young: ...(lost under Charlie) doing that<p>

<b>147:58:28</b> Duke: Got to get this out of the way.  (Pause)<p>

<b>147:58:31</b> England: And, Charlie, was that DAC off?<p>

<b>147:58:42</b> Duke: Yeah, I got the DAC off.<p>

<b>147:58:43</b> England: Okay. (Pause)<p>

<b>147:58:47</b> Duke: I think.  Let me go check again. <p>

<b>147:58:52</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>147:58:53</b> Duke: Hey, pan left, Tony.  Thanks for reminding me, Tony, (about the DAC).  I had forgotten it.<p>

<b>147:59:00</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat.  He is holding the
scoop.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1475903">147:59:03</a></b> Duke: If you'll pan left, we'll show you the rock we're going to sneak up on.<p>

<b>147:59:12</b> England: (Joking) Don't scare it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Despite Charlie's suggestion, Fendell continues the
clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:59:19</b> Duke: (To Fendell)  That's the wrong way.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell starts to pan counter-clockwise (left) while Charlie
turns to his left to look toward John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:59:21</b> Duke: (To John)  Hey, don't open...<p>

<b>147:59:23</b> Young: What?<p>

<b>147:59:24</b> Duke: Don't open that.<p>

<b>147:59:26</b> Young: It's between us and the LM!  It's between the LM
and us.<p>

<b>147:59:30</b> Duke: Oh, I know that; but they don't want you to open
that thing (meaning the sampler) until you get right up next to the
rock.

<blockquote><i>[By not opening the sampler head until the last minute, all forms of contamination can be minimized.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:59:35</b> Young: Is that what he said?

<blockquote><i>[John could be asking about instructions from the experiment PI or about instructions from Tony he might not have
heard.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:59:38</b> Duke: Well, that's...Not just now; no.<p>

<b>147:59:39</b> Young: Oh, yeah.  Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie seems to be talking about pre-flight discussions about procedures to avoid contamination.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:59:40</b> Duke: I'm going to get the other one...<p>

<b>147:59:42</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>147:59:43</b> Duke: ...for you.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is probably saying that he will get the skim and
scoop samples after John finishes with the pad samples.]<p>

[Fendell stops panning left and resumes the clockwise
pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:59:46</b> England: We agree with Charlie, there.  We'd like you to get up a little closer to it and face away from yourself before you open it.<p>

<b>147:59:55</b> Young: (Amused) Facing away from myself, huh?  Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Although it is possible that Tony is telling John to have his back to the LM before he opens the sampler head, it seems more likely that he is telling him to avoid opening the sampler in such a way that the pads are pointed toward his own suit.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:00:02</b> England: Right, you're filthy, as Fredo says.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fred Haise is the Apollo 16 backup Commander, who may be sitting with Tony.  Tony's comment implies that dust coming off the suits is a major concern.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:00:10</b> Duke: John, are you sneaking?<p>

<b>148:00:12</b> Young: Yeah.  Ahh!

<blockquote><i>[Fendell has stopped the clockwise pan.  The view is across
the left rear fender.  As indicated below, Fendell is confused as to just where John is. John is actually on the other side of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:00:18</b> England: Gee!  We're missing the great rock hunt here. 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans farther right, and gets a view of the LMP
seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:00:26</b> Duke: You're just not watching him sneak, Tony.<p>

<b>148:00:29</b> England: I'd sure like to.<p>

<b>148:00:30</b> Young: (To the rock)  I gotcha!

<blockquote><i>[In Houston, Fendell asks, &quot;Which way did he go?  He
said I was going the wrong way, and I went the other way.&quot;  Obviously,
he missed Charlie's &quot;If you'll pan left...&quot; at <a href="#1475903" target="new">147:59:03</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:00:37</b> Duke: What are you all doing looking at the seats!?!

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:00:40</b> England: Which way do we go?  (Pause)<p>

<b>148:00:48</b> Duke: Shh.  (Conspiratorially) We're sneaking up on it,
Tony.  (Pause)  Ah!  Got him!  Let me see, John.<p>

<b>148:01:01</b> Young: You can't see, Charlie, that's...

<blockquote><i>[John doesn't want to point the open sample pad toward
Charlie.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:01:04</b> Duke: From way out here, just point it at me.<p>

<b>148:01:06</b> Young: Oh.<p>

<b>148:01:08</b> Duke: You don't have any (garbled)  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds John and Charlie southwest of the Rover  and
a few meters north of the meter-sized rock John snuck up on.  As shown in
Figure <a href="../tools/judy03.jpg" title="image" target="new">3</a> in Judy Allton's 
<a href="../tools/Welcome.html" target="new">Tool Book</a>, there is only a small amount of soil
on the pad, all of it along the right edge.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:01:17</b> Duke: Okay;  here's the other one.  Give me that one, I'll...(Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1480128">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1480128.mp3" target="new">9 min 41 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>148:01:28</b> England: Gee!  The first lunar Great Rock Hunt and we missed it.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell zooms in.  John is trying to remove the Beta-cloth
sampler, which he has undoubtedly closed already.  Charlie plants the scoop and moves in to help.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:01:36</b> Young: Tell you something else.  I leaned on the rock
(laughing), and (I know) we can turn this one over (because it moved).<p>

<b>148:01:40</b> Duke: We can.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes the sampler in his right hand and holds it
steady while John frees the handle.  Charlie then gives John the second
sampling head, the one with the velvet pad.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:01:51</b> England: Okay.  Did that (rock movement) disturb the
surface on the other side there?<p>

<b>148:02:00</b> Young: The picture will show how I disturbed it.<p>

<b>148:02:02</b> England: Okay.  It's important that you put this second
one down in an area that wasn't...<p>

<b>148:02:06</b> Young: No, we didn't disturb it at all.<p>

<b>148:02:07</b> England: Okay, good.<p>

<b>148:02:10</b> Young: Yeah, we know that.<p>

<b><a name="1480211">148:02:11</a></b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie helps John free the Velcro strap that is holding
the sampler head closed.  John turns to face the rock and Charlie backs off
to the left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:02:17</b> Duke: There you go.  Get it?<p>

<b>148:02:22</b> Young: Yeah.  (To Tony) In an area that that (first sampler) didn't go in, right?<p>

<b>148:02:24</b> England: Right.<p>

<b>148:02:25</b> Duke: Tony, John...(Demonstrating) John was sneaking just like this.  He really got up to it before it...It didn't even know he was
coming.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie plants the left foot, picks up the trailing foot, brings it forward, well clear of the ground, by rotating his body to the left, and plants his right foot a foot or so in front of the left, and so on.  It is a very deliberate, slow walk.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:02:34</b> England: Outstanding, Charlie.  Thanks for the rerun.

<blockquote><i>[Although John has his back to us, it is apparent that he
has been having trouble getting the sampler ready.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:02:35</b> Young: Ah!<p>

<b>148:02:36</b> Duke: Man, that thing flops open.

<blockquote><i>[John is finally ready and approaches the rock carefully,
although not with quite the exaggerated motion Charlie demonstrated. 
Charlie goes around to the east side of the rock to
watch.  This suggests that PLSS exhaust is not a major concern.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:02:42</b> Duke: Okay, John, I'll give you a hint.  Man, that's a
great sneak.  Okay; that's good.  Right there.

<blockquote><i>[John leans to his right as he reaches over the rock and
tries to lower the pad vertically toward the surface on the far
side.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:02:52</b> England: Okay.  Just a little pressure.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John stands and swings the sampler head up to his right and rests the bottom part of the handle on his left hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:03:03</b> Duke: Beautiful!  You picked some up on that one.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie now has a view of the pad.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:03:05</b> Duke: Only on one corner.  He got some on one corner,
Houston.

<blockquote><i>[Figure <a href="../tools/judy03.jpg" title="image" target="new">3</a> from Judy Allton's Tool Book shows the Beta-cloth pad, which has lunar soil along the right edge.  Figure <a href="../tools/judy04.jpg" title="image" target="new">4</a> shows the velvet
pad, which has soil adhering to a relatively large patch at the lower
right.  Journal Contributor Simon Atkinson notes that the two imprints John will make with the sampler can be seen in photos AS16-107-
<a href="images16.html#17561" target="new">17561</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#17562" target="new">17562</a> that John takes at 148:07:43.  An <a href="a16det17561.jpg" title="image" target="new">enhanced detail</a> of 17561 gives us a view into the shadow. A comparison of the faint marks left by the sampling pads with the post-flight photos of the pads suggests that the sunlit imprint was made by the Beta cloth sample pad.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:03:11</b> England: Okay, we'll have to take it that way.<p>

<b>148:03:13</b> Young: That's too bad.  That's the way the ground is.

you've got to do to, like, stay current in an airplane.  You need so many
landings, you need so many approaches, you need so many whatevers.  So they
have a matrix, you know; and across the top you have columns and the
horizontal axis it might be the dates or something like that.  And when you
get one, you filled the square; you'd make a check mark and that was called
'filling the square'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

Normally, if you could turn it over (demonstrating by raising an imaginary scoop past vertical) like that, it would all fall out, because there was nothing to cause it to stick; but (there was) surface tension between the soils and the shovel, even though it was polished aluminum.  There was some tension there and, so, at that little low angle that I had there, you needed to shake it out.  But, generally, you didn't have to.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:14:44</b> Young: Okay, you want to just sort of sneak up so you
don't sprinkle any dirt down in the bottom of this place (meaning the
boulder imprint) where we turned it over.<p>

<b>148:14:50</b> Duke: Yeah, okay.

<blockquote><i>[As Charlie runs toward the boulder, using a loping stride
for a change, he gets good elevation and speed.  His form is similar to the
form he showed early in the ALSEP deployment.  He is showing no signs of
fatigue.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:14:51</b> Young: (Garbled) neat, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[As John and Charlie approach the boulder, they slow to a
walk and then stop to look at the imprint.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:14:52</b> Duke: Look at that soil!  It's all caked looking, isn't
it?<p>

<b>148:14:54</b> Young: Yeah, it is.  (Pause)  Okay.<p>

<b>148:15:01</b> Duke: Let me get the soil before you start whacking. 
Okay?<p>

<b>148:15:04</b> Young: Oh, yeah!

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes the hammer out of his shin
pocket.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:15:05</b> Duke: It's all glass-covered.  (Pause)  The bottom is
glass covered, Houston.<p>

<b>148:15:14</b> Young: Yeah, white glass.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gives the hammer to John.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:15:18</b> Duke: No, the black stuff is the glass.  That other is
crystal...That's a crystalline rock.<p>

<b>148:15:21</b> Young: Yeah, yeah.  Well, that part of it is. <p>

<b>148:15:24</b> England: Very good.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie digs deeply into the boulder
imprint.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:15:32</b> Duke: And it looks just like an alkali flat in the cake
that's under it, Tony.

<blockquote><i>[John puts the hammer on the boulder and gets a bag ready
while Charlie raises the scoop.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:15:40</b> Duke: And that's right from the deepest part.  (Pause)  That sample is right in the middle, which happens to be the deepest penetration that boulder made.<p>

<b>148:15:53</b> England: Very good.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stuck the tip of the scoop head in the bag and then rotated the handle up to pour.  Evidently, some of the sample wouldn't come off the scoop because John uses his free hand to grab the scoop head and shake it.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;The two of you never seem to have any particular
trouble getting these soil samples in the bags with you manipulating the scoop, John holding the bags.  That all seemed to go fairly well.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah; right.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Gene and Jack sometimes had a bit of trouble.  Jack was the one who used the scoop; he's the shorter one. And it sometimes got a little awkward.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, I was the taller one; so, when I used the shovel,
it was easier.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

Tony)  Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John kneels on the north side of the rock and delivers
sideways blows to the edge of a light-colored piece that appears to project
off the northeastern face.  He hits the rock eight times without
success.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:16:46</b> Duke: (Joking) Real friable, isn't it?<p>

<b>148:16:49</b> England: Now you found a real rock.

off the boulder, but straight toward the ground.  John
stands.]</i></blockquote>

handle in his left hand, walks around it and then backwards until his feet
are extended well behind him and he has most of his weight on the scoop. 
He reaches down slowly and carefully to grab the
fragment.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:17:09</b> Young: Can't you just pick it up with your shovel?<p>

<b>148:17:12</b> Duke: I didn't want to get it too dirty.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As he forces himself lower, Charlie finally rests his right
knee on the ground and begins to lift his left knee so he can get some
rotation down to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:17:17</b> Young: (Garbled)<p>

<b>148:17:21</b> Duke: Ah!

<blockquote><i>[Charlie finally has a grip on the fragment.  He pushes back
on the scoop and gets his full weight on both knees.  Before the suit
pitches him forward, he pulls the scoop out of the ground and then
re-plants it just in front of his knees.  In the process, he gets some soil
on his legs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:17:24</b> Duke: Ooops.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie pushes back on the scoop and rises without
trouble.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;This is a real nice example of the advantages of having
a little support and making use of a slope.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, it sloped away.  I sort of put my feet down below
the shovel, and so I could push back on it.  Once you got up over your
knees, the bend in suit gave you more spring and you were able to spring up
easier.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And did the slope also help you get down into the
kneeling position?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  Yeah; it did.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:17:26</b> Duke: There we go.  (To Houston) Okay, we got you about a
4-centimeter chip.<p>

<b>148:17:30</b> England: Okay, that sounds good.  Just get some photos of
it and I think we've done it.

<blockquote><i>[While John gets a bag out, Charlie examines the
fragment.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1481738">148:17:38</a></b> Duke: And that's not glass, John.  Those are crystals. 
Those are big crystals.  At least 5 millimeters, with a bluish cast to
them.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[This is sample 69955, a piece of crystalline rock with an included vein of glass.  It is shown in Figure 95C in the

[John puts his left foot back, leans forward so he can see his shin
pocket, opens it, and stows the hammer.  He then holds the bag out for Charlie.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:17:59</b> Young: That's going in bag 380, Houston. <p>

<b>148:18:07</b> Young: (Examining the fragment) It looks to me like it's a (pause) shocked rock with a lot of - and this is a guess - a lot of black glass in the fracture patterns.<p>

<b>148:18:20</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Because John is the one who has color film and takes the
cross-Sun &quot;afters&quot;, Charlie holds the scoop against the rock face
to provide scale.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:18:23</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>148:18:24</b> Duke: Okay, I'll hold it (next to the rock).  (Pause)<p>

<b>148:18:53</b> Duke: Frag was.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie presents his SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:18:54</b> Duke: Close my top on that thing, John.

Charlie's SCB, Charlie straightens the scoop head.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:19:19</b> England: Right.  We caught you with your fly open. <p>

<b>148:19:23</b> Duke: (Giggling)  Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Houston's concern is that, when they get back in the LM,
the OPS will be hot to the touch.  Charlie plants the scoop and leans
forward but the flap is still out of reach for John.  Charlie bends his
knees, but it is still a reach for John.]<p>

[Once they are back in the cabin and John is taking his gloves off at <a

<b>148:26:59</b> Young: Only happens in training.  You got it.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie finishes attaching the bags to John's camera and goes off-camera to the right, headed for the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:27:02</b> Young: How's my lens?<p>

<b>148:27:04</b> Duke: Turn into the Sun.  (Pause as John turns toward the southeast)  Okay.<p>

<b>148:27:09</b> Young: Got your finger...

<blockquote><i>[Apparently, Charlie is just off-camera to the right and has used his finger to raise John's lens to get a good look at
it.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:27:10</b> Duke: That's okay.  Won't even see that.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[While Charlie goes to the LMP seat, John takes a picture of Stone Mountain, AS16-114-
<a href="images16.html#18444" target="new">18444</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>148:27:16</b> Duke: (To Houston) Okay.  The DAC is set at f/8 at 12 frames a second.  And I'm not going to turn it on until we start moving, Tony.<p>

<b>148:27:22</b> England: Okay; that sounds good.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Previously, Charlie ran the 16-mm camera at 1 frame per second.  At 12 frames per second, he doesn't want to waste film by turning the camera on now.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:27:28</b> England: And we're going to have to move out.<p>

<b>148:27:29</b> Young: Okay, and I'm...(Stops to listens)<p>

<b>148:27:30</b> Duke: Yeah, we're mounting up right now.<p>

<b>148:27:34</b> Young: Frame Bravo of number 66.<p>

<b>148:27:39</b> England: Okay.  We copy 66.<p>

<b>148:27:40</b> Duke: You get the TV, John?<p>

<b>148:27:47</b> Young: I'll get it.  (Pause)  Okay.  (<a href="../alsj-LCRU.html" target="new">LCRU</a>) Mode switch to
1.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[TV off.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:27:58</b> Young: Oh, somebody already did it.

<blockquote><i>[John may be referring to the fact that the TV camera is
already pointed aft.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:28:01</b> Duke: They were looking at us with the big eye.<p>

<b>148:28:05</b> Young: There's a glass (garbled).<p>

<b><a name="1482811">148:28:11</a></b> England: And, John, we have a small configuration change.  We'd like both the (Rear) Steering and the Rear Powers to Bus Baker.<p>

<b>148:28:20</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[At <a href="#1475731" target="new">147:57:31</a>, shortly after John and Charlie arrived at Station 9, Houston asked John to pull the Battery 2 Bus D circuit breaker and there was some possible confusion caused by the fact that Tony said &quot;Bus D&quot; rather than &quot;Bus Dog&quot;.  Here, Tony avoids confusion, at least in this regard, by saying &quot;Bus Baker&quot;.]</i></blockquote>

<b>148:28:26</b> Duke: All the steering?<p>

<b>148:28:31</b> England: That's affirmative, the rear steering.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's confusion is caused by the fact that, while the
rear steering can be on either Bus B or Bus D, the forward steering can
only be on Bus A or Bus C.  It is impossible to have &quot;all the
steering&quot; on Bus B.  See the accompanying MSFC <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">photo</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>148:28:32</b> Young: (Lost under Tony) clean now.<p>

<b>148:28:34</b> Duke: I know it.  See, when you...(Stops to listen) 
Okay.<p>

<b>148:28:40</b> Duke: Man, I'm glad that you're driving this thing.  I
can't reach those buttons down there at the bottom.  You ought to get that before you get in. (Pause)<p>

<b>148:28:51</b> Young: What's that?<p>

<b>148:28:55</b> Duke: Drive...Rear Steering to Bus Baker. <p>

<b>148:28:57</b> England: Ah...<p>

<b><a name="1482859">148:28:59</a></b> Duke: Okay, you got all Batt 2 CBs (Circuit Breakers) out, Tony.

<blockquote><i>[This is confirmation that John pulled the Batt 2 Bus D
breaker at <a href="#1475731" target="new">147:57:31</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>148:29:03</b> England: Right.  We understand.  We're loading up Battery 1;  Battery 2's a little warm.<p>

<b>148:29:10</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>148:29:11</b> Young: Say again what he wants.  Did you get it,
Charlie?<p>

<b>148:29:17</b> Duke: No, I can't reach it;  Steering, Rear, Bus breaker
(means Baker).<p>

<b>148:29:20</b> England: Roger.<p>

<b>148:29:21</b> Young: Steering Rear to Bus Baker. <p>

<b>148:29:22</b> Duke: And what else, Tony?<p>

<b>148:29:23</b> England: The Drive Power to Bus Baker;  Rear Drive
Power.<p>

<b>148:29:30</b> Young: Rear Drive Power to Baker.  Okay, you got it.<p>

<b>148:29:33</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Houston wants to use Battery 1 exclusively.  This means
that the Forward Steering and Drive Power are on Bus C and the Rear
Steering and Drive Power are on Bus A.]</i></blockquote>
