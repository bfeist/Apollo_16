<b><a name="1681739">168:17:39</a></b> Duke: Tony, we're here, and I'm getting off; and then I'll read you the readings when I can brush it off so I can see.<p>

<b>168:17:45</b> England: Okay.  I understand.  (Pause)<p>

<b>168:17:58</b> Duke: This thing is covered with dirt.<p>

<b>168:18:01</b> England: Roger.  And our LCRU is heating up, so we'd like a good (dusting) job on those.  Even though we know you do it every time.<p>

<b>168:18:08</b> Duke: Needs dusting.  Needs dusting, bad.  Okay, Tony. (Reading the <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">console</a>) We're at 2...(correcting himself) 358, 184, 6.5, 3.8, 50, 120 (correcting himself) 110...Yeah, 110.  Off-scale low, off-scale low; Batt(ery temperature)s of 120, 135;  Rear is off-scale low on the Left; Right is 200.  Okay.  Forward is off-scale low, Left; (and) Right (is) 200.<p>

<b><a name="1681845">168:18:45</a></b> England:   Okay.  We copy.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[On the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp266-s.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-I, III,  2 of 2</a>&quot; map, the LM is near CB.1/80.6.  The LM bearing/range of 184/3.8 indicates they are near CW.1/81.9.  As shown in <a href="a16ppD2f13.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 13</a> in the <a href="D2_geology_north_ray.pdf" target="new">North Ray chapter</a> of the Professional Paper, the bearing/range to House Rock from their present location is 344/0.83.  As shown in the &quot;<a href="a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new">Descartes EVA-III 3 of 3</a>&quot; map, House Rock is at <a href="a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new">CZ.2/80.6</a> and that puts Station 13 close to <a href="a16.lsp272.jpg" title="map" target="new">CV.2/81.7</a>.  The position difference of 180 meters is comparable to the 250-meter error noted at Station 11 at <a href="a16.trvsta11.html#1664515" target="new">166:45:15</a>.  The fact that the difference has decreased may be due to the fact that John was using the Rover brakes on the steep descents.  If there was significant wheel slippage do to braking, the Rover Nav system would underestimate the distance covered.]

<b><a name="1681856">168:18:56</a></b> Duke: John, (as per <a href="a16eva3LMP-34.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-34</a>) I'm gonna start a pan.  (Pause)   <a href="../alsj-ValveCluster.html" target="new">Going to a little bit more cooling here</a>.<p>

<b>168:19:07</b> England: Okay.  The plan here is a rake soil first, together;  and after you've done that, we'd like John to take an <a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">LPM</a> (Lunar Portable Magnetometer reading) and, Charlie, you can go sample.<p>

<b>168:19:20</b> Duke:   Okay.  Let me get a pan first.  Okay?<p>

<b>168:19:24</b> England: Sounds good.<p>

<b>168:19:25</b> Young: Charlie, how does this look for the antenna pointing?<p>

<b>168:19:32</b> Duke: Looks about right on to me.<p>

<b>168:19:34</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>168:19:35</b> Duke: But that's hard...What's the signal strength?  (Burst of static as John turns on the TV)<p>

<b>168:21:07</b> Duke: I can see you... Sight's in the center.  Okay.  (Pause)  Look at that...Oh, I know.  That pattern on the ground (is) the mirror reflecting.  Boy.  (John chuckles) That faked me out.  I thought we'd really found something, Tony!<p>

<b>168:21:34</b> England: (Asking for clarification) How's that, Charlie?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie could be seeing spots of orange light on the ground next to the Rover.  These are actually reflections off the mirror blankets and the same phenomenon fooled Jack Schmitt during Apollo 17 Scarp Gravimeter stop at <a href="../a17/a17.trvsta3.html#1435935" target="new">143:59:35</a>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Do you remember if the reflection off the LCRU mirror was colored?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Not really.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Because it got Jack.  There was some little spots of orange on the ground a stop or two before they got to Shorty and the orange soil.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember what it looked like.  It probably was...Some of that Mylar was orange and it would have reflected and a couple of crystals (in the soil) would have picked up that orange reflection.  It could have been.&quot;]<p>

[TV on.  The camera is pointed southwest and is at maximum zoom.  <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pulls back on the zoom before he starts panning.  There are several sizable boulders visible on the local horizon.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1682138">168:21:38</a></b> England: Hey, we('ve) got a picture again.<p>

<b>168:21:40</b> Duke: How you reading, Tony?<p>

<b>168:21:42</b> England: Five by, Charlie.<p>

<b>168:21:43</b> Duke: (Responding to Tony's &quot;got a picture&quot;) Okay.  We had a little trouble pointing the antenna.  (Responding to  &quot;Five by&quot;)  Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John turns the TV camera to the right and cleans the lens with the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">large dustbrush</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1682149">168:21:49</a></b> Duke: Okay, Tony, this area here is on a...We're on about a 5-degree slope away from North Ray, and this big block that you'll see in a moment is downslope, filleted predominantly downslope here.  The surrounding terrain is covered with - not covered but 10 percent (covered) - with cobbles (about 64 mm to 256 mm).  It's very subdued on the meter-sized craters.  In fact, it's a very smooth plain, but on a slope.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans left.]<p>

[Charlie is probably taking the Station 13 pan while he describes the site.]</i></blockquote>

<a href="a16pan1682149.html" target="new"><b>Charlie's Station 13 Pan</b></a> ( frames AS16-106-
<a href="images16.html#17386" target="new">17386</a> to 
<a href="images16.html#17407" target="new">17407</a> )<p>

<b>168:22:21</b> Duke: The rock types here appear to be the same as we sampled up on top (at the North Ray rim), but we'll get you a rake-soil (sample) out in front of this big boulder over here.  (To John and/or himself)  Let's see; we need to get the bags and stuff.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise stop and then starts a clockwise pan of the site.  John crosses the field-of-view from right to left, probably going to the CDR seat.]<p>

[As Fendell pans past the high-gain mast, we see a wheel used to secure the mast during initial installation.  Fendell stops the pan at the same time Charlie starts talking.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:22:55</b> Duke: Okay, John, both of us got bags (meaning SCBs) on our backs, so why don't we just take these little bags.<p>

<b>168:23:00</b> Young: Yep.  Okay.<p>

<b>168:23:02</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John turns to his left and goes off-camera to the right,
going around the front of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:23:08</b> Young: I'm getting tongs for a gnomon.<p>

<b>168:23:09</b> Duke: Okay.  That's a good idea.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John re-appears from the right and bounds across the
field-of-view, headed for the back of the Rover to get a pair of tongs.]<p>

[Fendell continues the pan, stopping every few degrees to let someone in
the Backroom take a Polaroid photo of the scene.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1682318">168:23:18</a></b> England: Okay, Charlie; if you could
grab the bottom of the gnomon in the sheath there, we could use that for
our color and photometric scale.  We won't have the level (means
&quot;vertical&quot;), but at least we'll get part of it.<p>

<b>168:23:36</b> Young: Well, you could; (joking)  if there wasn't so much
igneous soil on it.  When I have it, we'll put it out there.<p>

<b>168:23:46</b> England: Okay.<p>

<blockquote><i>[John is referring both to the amount of dirt on the
color/gray scale and, jokingly, to the fact that they still have seen none
of the volcanic rocks that some of the geologists expected they would
find.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:23:47</b> Young: (Laughing) I can't believe it.<p>

<b>168:23:49</b> Duke: (Joining in the laughter) I can't believe it.

<blockquote><i>[Figuratively, if not literally, they are shaking their
heads in disbelief over all the minor equipment problems they are
having.]<p>

[Fendell is looking more or less north.  As he continues to pan to the
right, Charlie comes into view at the right side of the picture.  He is
carrying the rake.  At about the same time, John comes into view, running
out to join Charlie and carrying the tongs and the gnomon
legs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:23:56</b> Duke: (Pointing with the rake)  Okay, John.  See those -
about four or five - little rocks right there?<p>

<b>168:24:00</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>168:24:01</b> Duke: Stick her down right there and let me...I'm sort of
turned around here on my direction.  I think I'm facing...South is over
this way.  The Sun's up over Stone.  I can't believe it.<p>

<b>168:24:11</b> Young: The Sun is so high.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[They had planned to start EVA-3 at a Ground Elapsed Time
(GET) of 148:25 and Station 13 three and a half hours later at a GET of
about 152 hours.  As is shown in Figure <a href="a16.lsp006.jpg" title="image" target="new">2.3-1</a> in the Lunar Surface
Procedures volume, the Sun's elevation at that time would have been about
38 degrees.  Because of the landing delay and the changes in EVA schedule,
the Sun's elevation is currently 46 degrees.  When Charlie says that the
Sun is &quot;up over Stone&quot;, he has either mis-spoken and meant to say
&quot;Smoky&quot; or is merely referring to the significant elevation.  Sun's azimuth is about 80 degrees east of north while the summit of Stone mountain is at an azimuth of about 170.]<p>

[John puts the gnomon down near the rocks Charlie had indicated.  Charlie gets into position to take a down-Sun &quot;before&quot;.  Fendell
continues the clockwise pan; and Shadow Rock comes into view at the right side of the picture.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:24:19</b> Young: Old gnomon (garbled).  (Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1682429">168:24:28</a></b> Duke: There's the down-Sun, and we'll...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie's down-Sun &quot;before&quot; is AS16-106-
<a href="images16.html#17408" target="new">17408</a>.  John's cross-Sun
stereopair from the south is AS16-116-

<a href="images16.html#18662" target="new">18662</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>168:24:31</b> Duke: Up the slope, adroitly; like a gazelle!  Got to Station 13, Tony, and it sure looks good.<p>

<b>168:24:50</b> England: Good show.  It looks good here, too.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell is looking at the right side of Shadow Rock, with
Ravine Crater on the flank of Smoky Mountain in the background.  Charlie is
probably taking a &quot;locator&quot; AS16-106-<a href="images16.html#17409" target="new">17409</a>, which shows John holding the tongs and, in the
background, the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:24:55</b> Duke: Okay; the regolith...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>168:25:00</b> Young: (Let me) get a bag from you, Charlie.<p>

<b>168:25:01</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  Okay.  There's some glass in there,
a black chip.  In one rake, we got about 10 little...And the regolith here,
Tony, seems to be a little bit more loosely compacted than up on the top
(meaning on the rim of North Ray).<p>

<b>168:25:35</b> Young: I can't get my gnomon (meaning the tongs) in.<p>

<b>168:25:37</b> Duke: That's okay.  (Pause)  (To Tony)  Not very
productive, though, on the small chips.<p>

<b><a name="1682550">168:25:50</a></b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John may have just taken AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18663" target="new">18663</a> and <a href="images16.html#18664" target="new">18664</a>, which are cross-Suns from the south showing Charlie raking.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:25:51</b> England: We'll...<p>

<b>168:25:52</b> Duke: (lost under Tony)<p>

<b>168:25:52</b> England: ...just take what you've got.<p>

<b>168:25:54</b> Duke: ...if I'd rake upslope, though, I bet you I'd get
more.<p>

<b>168:25:56</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As Fendell approaches the clockwise stop, Stone Mountain is
visible over the LMP seat.  Fendell reverses direction.]<p>

[Charlie has moved around to the south side of the gnomon, as shown in
John's photo AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18665" target="new">18665</a>, which he took from the
north side of the gnomon.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was better to be raking up slope because, raking down
slope, you couldn't get the handle low enough to keep the tines parallel to
the surface.  They were elevated, so you couldn't dig them in that far. 
So, raking upslope, your tines get parallel to the surface and you can
actually dig them in a little bit more.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:26:19</b> Young: Okay...<p>

<b>168:26:20</b> Duke: Now here's a few more.<p>

<b>168:26:21</b> Young: ...that's a good one.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[At some point, John moves around and takes a final picture from the south, AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18666" target="new">18666</a>, as Charlie finishes the raking.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:26:29</b> LM Crew: Okay.<p>

<b>168:26:30</b> Young: There's about 20 small rocks going into bag 343.<p>

<b>168:26:33</b> England: Okay.  Bag 343.<p>

<b>168:26:34</b> Duke: That's three scoopfuls (meaning &quot;rake swaths&quot;), Tony.<p>

<b>168:26:37</b> England: Good show.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[These samples are 63520-98 and are shown in Figures 36A to 36I in the Professional paper.  The collection includes fragments of both breccias and crystalline rocks.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:26:46</b> Duke: Okay, and a soil.<p>

<b>168:26:51</b> Young: (I've got to) get another bag from you, Charlie.<p>

<b>168:26:53</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell gets Shadow Rock centered in the TV picture and zooms in on the shadowed south face.  Tony asks the Backroom if this might be a place to get a permanently shadowed sample and Jim Lovell, the spokesman for the Backroom, replies that they don't have enough time at this stop to do that.  As Fendell zooms in, the automatic iris opens and we get a reasonably good look at the shadowed rock face.  Lovell tells Flight that, while John gets the LPM measurement, they'd like to have Charlie sample the boulder.]</i></blockquote>

( <a href="a16a1682701.mp3" target="new">11 min 39 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>168:27:01</b> Duke: Ah, huh-huh.  Ah, the old suit, (it) wins every time.  (Pause)  I can't bend this beauty like we could on the training grounds.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is using the rake to get a soil sample and,
apparently, is having trouble getting his suit to bend
enough.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:27:18</b> Young: (Garbled)   Okay, that looks like 2 scoopsfuls (sic) going into bag 346.<p>

<b>168:27:26</b> Duke: Sack it!<p>

<b>168:27:27</b> England: Okay, 346.<p>

<b><a name="1682731">168:27:31</a></b> Young: Ah, isn't that beautiful.  If
it gets out of there, we'll call it Houdini.

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to the American escape artist, Harry
Houdini (1874-1926).]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:27:35</b> Duke: (Laughing)  Yeah.  Tony, it...<p>

<b>168:27:41</b> England: And Charlie, you might look around...<p>

<b>168:27:44</b> Duke: Houston, the big eye (meaning the TV) is looking
right at that big rock.  What do you think of that beauty?<p>

<b>168:27:45</b> England: That's exactly what we're looking at...<p>

<b>168:27:48</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b><a name="1682749">168:27:49</a></b> England: ...While John's doing the LPM, we'd like you to
hammer on that rock a bit.<p>

<b>168:27:53</b> Duke: I am gonna hammer.  I'll hammer chips from
corners.<p>

<b>168:27:57</b> England: Okay.  Good show.<p>

<b>168:27:58</b> Duke: That's what I had in mind.

<blockquote><i>[As Fendell pulls back on the zoom, Charlie crosses the
field-of-view and goes around the right side of the Rover.  He is probably
headed to the back of the vehicle to stow the rake.  At about this time,
John takes a cross-Sun &quot;after&quot; of the rake site, AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18667" target="new">18667</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:28:00</b> England: (On his own initiative) And if you get a chance -
and it looks like some soil right on the south side, kind of underneath,
might be permanently shadowed - you might take some of those and just put
it in a bag.<p>

<b>168:28:11</b> Duke: All righty.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>168:28:27</b> Young: Well, Houston, I didn't park too good to do the LPM.  If I go 45 feet from here, I'm going to be in the middle of a crater.

Is that okay?

<blockquote><i>[John would normally position the LPM down-Sun of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:28:37</b> England: No.  Pick a fairly level place...<p>

<b>168:28:38</b> Young: (Garbled) slope.<p>

<b>168:28:39</b> England: ...just go a different direction.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:28:44</b> Young: Okay.  You don't mind if I go out behind the Rover, for example?<p>

<b>168:28:47</b> England: (Answering John just before Experiments tells him the same thing)  No, that's fine.<p>

<b>168:28:50</b> Young: Instead of at right angles to it.<p>

<b>168:28:53</b> Duke: John, where's those bags that's still got the
bracket on it. Is it under your seat here?<p>

<b>168:28:58</b> Young: What?<p>

<b>168:29:00</b> Duke: The bags that had the brackets on them?<p>

<b>168:29:01</b> Young: I think they were about out.<p>

<b>168:29:05</b> Duke: No.  Yeah.  Here you go.<p>

<b>168:29:06</b> England: Okay, if you go out south, be a little careful on that cable;  it'll be pulling at 90 degrees then.

<blockquote><i>[Apparently, the magnetometer cable attachment at the back of the Rover points toward the left and, if John goes out behind the Rover, the cable will be bent and will have uneven stress at the connection.]<p>

[Fendell finds John at the back of the Rover, behind the LMP
seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:29:16</b> Young: Okay, well I think I'll go out as far...I'll go out south...(Pause)  How about east-southeast?<p>

<b>168:29:30</b> England: Okay.  Fine.

<blockquote><i>[John lifts the <a href="a16.s70-56721.jpg" title="image" target="new">LPM
tripod</a> out of its holder and backs away from the Rover to the
southeast.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:29:31</b> Young: It's off to the starboard bow or something.

<blockquote><i>[John is a Naval Aviator and, like many naval aviators, doesn't use nautical terminology with ease.  Of course, John often has trouble expressing himself clearly and those who do not know him sometimes do not realize that this is part of a facade that hides a splendid engineering mind.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:29:35</b> Duke: Tony, we're about out of bags!  Did we sample that much?<p>

<b>168:29:38</b> England: Oh, you've been really packing them away.<p>

<b>168:29:40</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony) losing bags?<p>

<b>168:29:41</b> Young: Yeah, we've only lost one set of (unused) bags,
Charlie.<p>

<b>168:29:48</b> Duke: (To himself) Okay.  Here we go.  Well, we've got a
few left here.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John goes off-camera to the left and Charlie comes into view for a moment at the right edge of the picture.  He appears to be several meters south of the Rover.  After a few seconds, Fendell pans left to find John.  Off-camera, Charlie probably goes to Shadow Rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:30:12</b> Duke: Okay.  I'm going to get on the sunset...(Correcting himself) sunlit side, Tony, so I'll know what (pause) I'm whacking on here.  You know, Tony.  That might be a permanently-shadowed soil right in there.  I think it is, as a matter of fact.  It'll pass (meaning it will be suitable).<p>

<b><a name="1683035">168:30:35</a></b> Duke: I sure wish we had the S(ESC)...(Stops to listen)  Okay, I'll do it.  (To Tony) Hey, what's the (Hasselblad) settings for in there (into the deep shadow)?  250 at 5/6?  Would that look into there?<p>

<b>168:30:52</b> England: Let's try that.

<blockquote><i>[The <a href="../tools/judy93.jpg" title="image" target="new">SESC</a>, or Special Environmental Sample Can, is the
vacuum sealed container that they lost on the way to North Ray Crater.  See Charlie's comment at <a href="a16.sta11.html#1670016" target="new">167:00:16</a>.  See, also, <a href="../tools/judy91.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 91</a> in Judy Allton's Tool Catalog.  Once the permanently shadowed sample is returned to Earth, it will be analyzed to determine the relative abundances of volatile components implanted by the Solar Wind and, to get the best results, Charlie had planned to use the SESC to provide backup vacuum protection to the rock box.]<p>

[John has reached the end of the magnetometer cable and is taking a few moments to position the tripod.]<p>

[At Shadow Rock, Charlie takes three pictures of the permanently-shadowed area, AS16-106-
<a href="images16.html#17410" target="new">17410</a>, 
<a href="images16.html#17411" target="new">17411</a>, and 
<a href="images16.html#17412" target="new">17412</a>.  He steps to his left between frames.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:30:53</b> Duke: Yes sir, baby.  That is a perfect shadowed soil sample.<p>

<b>168:31:01</b> England: Outstanding! (Pause)<p>

<b>168:31:05</b> Duke: It is really perfect!  John, you couldn't have picked a better rock.<p>

<b>168:31:07</b> Young: You're kidding.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans left to find Charlie.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:31:08</b> Duke: No, it's really perfect.  Just great!  (Pause)  I have to get my (gold) visor up to see something.  (Laughing) Man, I can't believe I'm going (to reach) under this beauty.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As Fendell pans past the right edge of Shadow Rock, we see the tongs planted in the ground, out of the way while Charlie uses the scoop.  Fendell then finds Charlie who is on his knees in the shadow of the boulder and with his back to us.  He is collecting a soil sample with the scoop.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I gather that there's a hollow place back in there, in the shadow and under the rock.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh.  That rock is sitting up there and it's like somebody dug out under there.  The rock's coming up like this and, right up under here, there's like a hole...It was sort of like it was tottering up there.  And I could get down on my knees and I could reach </i>way<i> back up under there with the shovel.  'About a meter', I said (at <a href="#1683201" target="new">168:32:01</a>).&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you have to hold on to the rock to get your knees bent?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I was on the ground; yeah.  That's what I did.&quot;]<p>

[After a few seconds, Charlie rises to his feet.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:31:53</b> Duke: Well, I don't know how long that rock's been there, but that dirt has been shadowed ever since it's been there.<p>

<b>168:31:59</b> England: Okay.  That's what we want, Charlie.<p>

<b><a name="1683201">168:32:01</a></b> Duke: I guarantee you.  That's
way...I got it from about a meter up under there, Tony.<p>

<b>168:32:08</b> England: Good show.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie has the scoop in his right hand, and is probably
holding it near the head.  The scoop handle is visible at Charlie's left
side.  He uses his left hand to remove a sample bag from his
camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:32:13</b> Duke: And I'm sorry, but it's gonna have to go in an old
plastic bag, here, (instead of the SESC).<p>

<b>168:32:18</b> England: That's okay.

<blockquote><i>[Out of view, Charlie appears to transfer the bag to his right hand and the scoop to his left.  Once again, he appears to be holding the scoop near the head and has no trouble rotating the handle up  to make the pour.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:32:20</b> Duke: And it's number 426.<p>

<b>168:32:21</b> England: Okay.  Bag 426.  Any chance of getting soil underneath that now for the control?<p>

<b>168:32:30</b> Duke: Ah...Underneath...The shadowed, you mean?

<blockquote><i>[Charlie turns to his right, facing east.]</i></blockquote>

<p>

<b>168:32:33</b> England: Right.  Underneath where you just took (the first sample); just dig deeper.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie steps out of the shadow far enough that his helmet is in full Sun.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:32:40</b> Duke: That way...(Stops to listen)  Yeah.  Let me...put my visor down.  That thing (meaning the Sun) is bright.  Get out of the Sun.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie turns a half circle to his right and, facing west, steps back into the shadow.  He transfers the sample bag to his left hand and uses his right to lower his gold visor.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:32:54</b> Duke: (Responding to Tony's request for a deep soil
sample)  Yeah, I can get that for you.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie turns to face the Rover and plants the scoop to his
left, near the rake.  He then heads for the Rover, sealing  the bag as he
goes, and goes off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:33:04</b> Duke: That's about 100 grams, Tony;  maybe 200.<p>

<b>168:33:07</b> England: That's all we need.<p>

<b>168:33:12</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans right.  In the background, Ravine Crater is
the very large depression on the southern flank of Smoky
Mountain.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1683314">168:33:14</a></b> Young: Ah, I forgot to turn that
thing on before I left the Rover.<p>

<b>168:33:20</b> Duke: (Subvocal) I don't know how to turn it on.

<blockquote><i>[John was supposed to turn the magnetometer on before he
left the Rover so that the sensor could warm up before he started the first
measurement.  Charlie is probably at the back of the Rover but hasn't done
much training with the magnetometer and is not confident that he can turn
it on.  At <a href="#1683332" target="new">168:33:32</a> John tells Houston
that he's back at the Rover, although his tone of voice suggests he got
back earlier, perhaps as early as <a href="#1683323" target="new">168:33:23</a>.  It would have taken John about 15 seconds to
run the 15-meter distance from the magnetometer to the Rover - as he does,
on-camera, at <a href="#1683729" target="new">168:37:29</a> - and  it is
simply not possible that he left the magnetometer at <a href="#1683314" target="new">168:33:14</a> and arrived at 168:33:23.  Neither is it
possible that Charlie turned it on while John was still at the magnetometer
at 168:33:23, because there is no way that John then could have gotten back
to the Rover before 168:33:32.  The only way I can make the timing work is
if John started back to the Rover before 168:33:14 and, on the way,
realized that he hadn't turned on the instrument.  He then gets to the
Rover at about 168:33:23 and puts the switch to the On
position.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1683323">168:33:23</a></b> Young: Okay; well, it's on now.<p>

<b>168:33:26</b> Duke: (Garbled) that free.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is probably trying to get a spare SCB off the back
of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:33:26</b> Young: Okay, how long does it take it to warm up, Tony?<p>

<b>168:33:30</b> England: We're getting that (information), John.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left. 
He is headed back to Shadow Rock and is carrying a spare SCB.  Fendell
continues to pan until the magnetometer comes into view and then
stops.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1683332">168:33:32</a></b> Young: I'm back at the Rover. 
(Hearing Tony)  Huh?  Say again.<p>

<b>168:33:39</b> England: Okay.  We'll take a mark now, and go a minute and
a half, and I'll tell you when (to start the measurement).<p>

<b><a name="1683346">168:33:46</a></b> Young: Okay.  You go.  (I'll)  get a picture of it.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reverses direction to find Charlie.]<p>

[John takes two pictures of the magnetometer.  AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18668" target="new">18668</a> is a &quot;locator&quot; taken past the back of the
Rover and <a href="images16.html#18669" target="new">18669</a> is a stereo companion taken over the seats.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1683352">168:33:52</a></b> Duke: That would have...John, that shopping bag would have been...Should have gone down to the supermarket and bought one.<p>

<b>168:33:56</b> Young: They give 'em to you at the supermarket, Charlie. 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The SCB comes into view.  Charlie placed it upright near
the rake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:34:04</b> Duke: (To Houston) See how that sample bag is...<p>

<b>168:34:08</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>168:34:09</b> Duke: ...is sitting up there - (correcting himself) I mean that SCB - is sitting up there, Tony.<p>

<b>168:34:11</b> England: Yep, sure do.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie kneeling in front of the boulder, with his back to us.  He is in about the same position he was in when he got the first soil sample.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:34:16</b> Duke: What you need, looks like to me, is a bag that has two handles on it...

<blockquote><i>[This is a repeat of the discussion of Charlie's
&quot;shopping bag&quot; idea, which he first raised at <a href="a16.sta11.html#1673450" target="new">167:34:50 </a>at North Ray Crater.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:34:21</b> Young: Can I help you, Charlie?  Let me put that in the bag.<p>

<b>168:34:24</b> Duke: I got it.<p>

<b>168:34:25</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie rises to his feet and John joins him from the left.  John reaches to get a bag off Charlie's camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:34:27</b> Duke: That ain't very much, but we'll keep ...  Oh, you just kicked (some soil on the sample area)...Well, I got enough.  Go ahead (and get a bag).

<blockquote><i>[Fendell zooms in on the sample area but, because of the relative brightness of Charlie's legs, we can't see any detail in the shadow at the base of the rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:34:35</b> England: Okay.  That'll be good on the soil sample.  And we'd like to spend the rest of the time - and there isn't much of it - hammering on that rock.<p>

<b>168:34:46</b> Duke: Okay, there's about 50 grams in the control (soil sample).<p>

<b>168:34:49</b> England: That's fine.<p>

<b>168:34:50</b> Young: It's going into bag 427.<p>

<b>168:34:53</b> England: Okay, 427.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes off-camera to the right and, as he does, the automatic iris on the TV opens up and we get a view of the mottled surface of the base of the rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:35:00</b> Young: Boy.  It just might be permanently shadowed, Houston; because it's downslope, and when the...Golly.<p>

<b><a name="1683507">168:35:07</a></b> Duke: I think it...John, I reached back in there about...Pull your visor up and look under there.  I reached in there about 2 to 3 feet, it looked like to me.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pulls back on the zoom and finds John, who was just off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:35:20</b> Young: Oh, that there is one of those gopher holes.<p>

<b>168:35:23</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>168:35:27</b> England: (Joking) Hey, John...<p>

<b>168:35:28</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>168:35:28</b> England: (do) you think you can push that one over?<p>

<b><a name="1683530">168:35:30</a></b> Duke: Do that (meaning reach under a rock) in West Texas
and you...(Stops to listen)  No.

<blockquote><i>[John finishes his examination of Shadow Rock, turns to his right, and hops out past the SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:35:32</b> Duke: (Finishing the thought) You do that in West Texas, and you get a rattlesnake.  Here, you get permanently-shadowed soil.

<blockquote><i>[John turns to his left to examine the rock from a distance of a couple of meters.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:35:37</b> Young: One thing about this rock is it has some...This is
the one that I noticed when we were coming up the way (to Station 11) that
had some of these holes in it (that) look like vesicles, Charlie.<p>

<b>168:35:45</b> Duke: Yep, they sure do, big ones.  Biggies.

<blockquote><i>[John did not mention vesicles during the traverse to
Station 11, although Charlie's use of the term &quot;frothy-looking
boulders&quot; in the discussion after <a href="a16.trvsta11.html#1663549" target="new">166:35:49</a> may be a reference to
vesicles.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1683548">168:35:48</a></b> Duke: I'm out of film, I think.

<blockquote><i>[During this conversation, Charlie has been taking a series

<b>168:35:50</b> Young: Couldn't be zap holes.

<blockquote><i>[&quot;Zap holes&quot; or &quot;zap pits&quot; are small
craters dug into the surface of a rock by a small impact.  Vesicles are
imprints of gas bubbles trapped in a molten rock as it cools.  Here, John
is probably seeing vesicles formed when parts of Shadow Rock were molten,
perhaps during the North Ray impact when it was ejected.  According to
George Ulrich, the author of the North Ray chapter in the Professional
Paper, Shadow Rock is a dark-matrix breccia similar to House
Rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:35:53</b> Duke: Hey, John...(Changing his mind) Nothing.

<blockquote><i>[John reaches down, opens the top of the SCB, and stows the
second soil sample.  Behind him, Charlie leans the scoop against the east
face of the rock and leans in to get his face plate close to the top of a
small projection.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:35:54</b> England: Okay, Charlie. We'd like magazine Foxtrot (Apollo
magazine 117) on your camera.<p>

<b>168:36:00</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John runs over to help Charlie.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:36:01</b> England: And, John, you can do the LPM any time (because
it has warmed up).<p>

<b>168:36:06</b> Duke: What a time to run out of (film)...Okay...(Stops to
listen to Tony)<p>

<b>168:36:08</b> Young: Okay.  Let me take a picture for you, Charlie. 
Where at and how much?<p>

<b><a name="1683609">168:36:09</a></b> Duke: Oh, that's okay.  Look at
this!

<blockquote><i>[During Charlie's next transmission, John takes a cross-Sun
stereopair from the south that shows Charlie and the rock face he is
examining.  These pictures are AS16-116-
<a href="images16.html#18670" target="new">18670</a> and

to the Rover and goes off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:36:12</b> Duke: Tony, this is the black matrix with some excellent
crystals in it that also are milky in color.  Don't see any cleavage though
or striations.  (The crystals are) about a centimeter across; and it has a
matrix (means &quot;clasts&quot;) of that white rock, like up on the rim. 
(Correcting himself) Not a matrix, but some clasts of that (white
material).

<blockquote><i>[Cleavage, in mineralogy, is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite crystallographic structural planes. These planes of relative weakness are a result of the regular locations of atoms and ions in the crystal, which create smooth repeating surfaces that are visible both in the microscope and to the naked eye.]<p>

[Charlie runs back to the Rover to change film and goes
off-camera to the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:36:44</b> Duke: (To himself) There you go.<p>

<b>168:36:43</b> Young: (Garbled; Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pulls back on the zoom and Charlie crosses the
field-of-view from right to left, probably going to the CDR seat where the
fresh magazines are stored.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:36:51</b> Duke: Tony, say again the mag?<p>

<b>168:36:54</b> England: You'll need magazine Foxtrot, and we're about out

<b>168:36:56</b> Young: Okay, Houston, we're ready to take the L(PM or
Lunar Portable Magnetometer)...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>168:36:58</b> England: ...we'd like to sample...Okay.  Go ahead, John.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans right.]</i></blockquote>

at the right edge of the TV picture.  He turns and runs out to get the
magnetometer, making the 15-m trip in about 14 seconds.]<p>

[Off-camera, Charlie has probably finished loading Magazine F into his
Hasselblad and has taken a frame, AS16-117-

<blockquote><i>[John steps toward the right-rear corner of the Rover.  He has been carrying the magnetometer tripod in his right hand and realizes that, to get everything stowed, he needs to have the cable entirely on his left side.  To fix the problem, he turns to his right and goes through 360 degrees, transferring the tripod to his left hand as he turns through north.  He then stows the tripod in its sleeve on the back of the Rover, knocking down the back of LMP seat in the process.  In principle, John could have lifted the tripod high enough to pass the cable over his head while still facing the Rover, but there would have been a good chance of snagging the cable on his PLSS  and his decision to make the 360 degree turn was probably a good one.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1683918">168:39:18</a></b> Duke: (To himself)  Great place to pick it.  Two great places to whack it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Before Fendell gets Shadow Rock in view, John re-appears, running back to the cable reel.  As Fendell continues the pan, Charlie comes into view, holding the hammer.  He steps toward a corner on the southeast side  of the boulder and knocks a sample off.  He taps the rock several times, left-handed, and breaks at least one loose.  He then steps back, transfers the hammer to his right hand and stows it in his <a href="A16ShinPocket.html" target="new">shin pocket</a>.

<b><a name="1684114">168:41:14</a></b> Young: (Laughs)  Charlie.  Thanks for those words of encouragement.  (Hearty laughter from Charlie)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets the scoop in his left hand and, uses it as a prop while he goes to his knees next to the SCB.  Once down, he grabs a large sample in his right hand and rolls it against his knee, much as he did with Big Muley at <a href="a16.sta1.html#1240801" target="new">124:08:01</a> at
Station 1.  However, this rock, unlike Big Muley, is small enough that,
eventually, he gets his hand completely under it and can get to his feet without having to press the sample against his leg.  This large sample is 60017, a 2.1 kg breccia which is shown in Figure 35C in the <a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">Professional Paper</a>.  In a footnote to the figure, the authors of the Professional Paper
state that &quot;sample 60017 was assigned a LM/ALSEP number (that is, the initial '60') before its source location at Station 13 was recognized with assurance.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:41:17</b> Duke: And, Tony, this rock here looks like...It's the same character as the ones (like House Rock) up on the rim (of North Ray).<p>

<b><a name="1684133">168:41:33</a></b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie transfers the sample to his left hand, grabs the SCB cover in his right hand.  The SCB opens as he lifts it and he then drops the sample, unbagged, into the SCB.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:41:34</b> Duke: (It's like) that great, huge black one that we sampled, except that one up there didn't have any of these holes in it.  I can't really say what these holes are here.  (Pause)  They just look...They're vugs.  Let's just call them vugs.  What caused them, I don't know.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie grabs the tongs and, carrying the tongs, scoop, and SCB, heads toward the Rover and goes off-camera to the right.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;This is a really nice little piece of TV about efficient
solo sampling.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  You're working around a rock like that, it was a lot
easier.  I had the tongs; I came prepared.  I had the little sample bag
(SCB) on the ground.  Once you get that way, you don't have to take all
those pictures and stuff.  You could work solo, if you had everything. 
We've learned a little bit, so we got more efficient at it.  We knew what
to take with us.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You could use the shovel as a prop to help you get down on
your knees and then get back up.  Use the rock.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;And we had the tongs.  It worked pretty good.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And I guess sampling a rock face was a little bit
easier...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was easy to hammer.  You didn't have to get real low to
hammer, like John did a couple of times over at Plum.  It just worked
well.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It seems to me that the suit designers for the extended
mission are going to have to think carefully about reinforcing the knees or
having some kind of a replacement pad; because, being able to get down
close to the ground is vital for not only this work but, also, all the
non-geology stuff that people are going to be doing later on.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You need a lot more mobility in that suit.  Seems to me you needed something where you could bend at the waist and bend at the knees, basically like you could walk up steps.  You couldn't do that in the Apollo suit.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You couldn't walk up steps.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;And you couldn't bend at the waist.  It's just too stiff. 
The arms weren't bad; the mobility in the arms was pretty good.  And the
<a href="A16CMDLeftEVGlove.html" target="new">gloves</a> were pretty good, they're just hard to squeeze.  Yeah; it's going to
require a lot of thought, for a stay of a month or
more.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:42:00</b> Young: Yeah.  They look more vuggy to me; although they're round.<p>

<b>168:42:03</b> Duke: They look like drill holes is what they look like.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell pans right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:42:05</b> Young: Yeah, that's right.  They look like...You know what they look like?  They look like those...<p>

<b>168:42:10</b> Duke: Help me.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie wants John to take the scoop and tongs while he stows the SCB under the LMP seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:42:16</b> Duke: Here, put those (tools) up for me.<p>

<b>168:42:18</b> Young: Okay.  They look like the holes that you get in rocks where you have a venting of gas that comes up through there like a long...You know what I mean, Tony?<p>

<b>168:42:29</b> England: Sure do.  Sure do.<p>

<b>168:42:31</b> Duke: Vesicle pipe.<p>

<b>168:42:33</b> Young: Yeah, vesicle pipe.  That's it.<p>

<b>168:42:34</b> Duke: Vesicle pipes.<p>

<b>168:42:35</b> Young: There you go.  (Pause)<p>

<b>168:42:40</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie at the LMP seat.  Charlie turns and sees the TV looking at him.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:42:42</b> Duke: Hi, big eye.<p>

<b>168:42:44</b> England: Hi there, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[John is at the back of the Rover stowing the
tools.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:42:46</b> Duke: (Perhaps looking at <a href="a16eva3LMP-34.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-34</a>) Okay, let's see.  (Hearing Tony's greeting) Yeah.  (Pause)  Okay, John.  I'll turn off the TV for you.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie goes off-camera to the right, headed to the
<a href="../LCRU-CREW-52.jpg" title="LCRU Battery" target="new">controls</a> on the left side of the LCRU.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:42:53</b> Young: Okay.  Let me put the scoop back.<p>

<b>168:43:03</b> Duke: Okay, going to (<a href="../LCRU-CREW-35.jpg" title="LCRU Control Panel" target="new">LCRU S-Band Mode</a>) 1 (PM1/NB) right now.<p>

<b>168:43:05</b> Young: Roger.

<blockquote><i>[TV off.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:43:09</b> Duke: (Lost in the switchover from the high-gain to the
low gain)...(I'm turning the TV fully) counter-clockwise.  That (TV) is a
beautiful little piece of gear.  (Pause) <p>

<b>168:43:21</b> England: Charlie, you've got about 4 minutes (of film
left) on the DAC...<p>

<b>168:43:23</b> Duke: Okay.  (To Tony)  Can we...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>168:43:24</b> England: ...at 12 frames per second; and you can either use it that way or one frame per second, either way you want, on the way back, whichever looks best to you.<p>

<b>168:43:35</b> Young: Why don't we go at one frame a second all the way back in, to the Rover (means the LM)?<p>

<b>168:43:39</b> Duke: (Garbled)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is probably trying to get in the LMP
seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:43:41</b> Young: Huh?<p>

<b>168:43:42</b> Duke: What am I hung up on, John?<p>

<b>168:43:45</b> Young: Your bag is hung up, Charlie.<p>

<b>168:43:46</b> Duke: Oh shoot.  You know, that's probably why yours came off.<p>

<b>168:43:51</b> Young: Yeah, you got to...(Pause)  There you go.<p>

<b>168:43:55</b> Duke: Okay.  Is it free now?<p>

<b>168:43:58</b> Young: Let me tighten it down.  There you go.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;What I think I'm hearing here is that you
were getting on the Rover but the SCB was getting hung up on the seat.  Is
that right?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I thought the SCB was on the outside.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It is; but I was getting hung up on something.  I don't
remember.  I think, probably, what it was is once you get in, if you get in
sideways, that bag can hit on the side of the seat.  And then you're trying
to get straightened back in there.  That's what
happened.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:44:01</b> England: And, we'd like your frame (count)s before you
load up.<p>

<b>168:44:03</b> Duke: Thanks.<p>

<b>168:44:09</b> Young: Let me get yours, Charlie.<p>

<b>168:44:11</b> Duke: (To Tony) Okay.  I'm (frame) 6 on magazine Foxtrot,
and I finished up...<p>

<b>168:44:17</b> Young: I'm a 112.<p>

<b>168:44:18</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>168:44:21</b> Young: Didn't take many that time.<p>

<b>168:44:27</b> Duke: Boy, that Smoky Mountain...<p>

<b>168:44:28</b> Young: (Correcting himself) Make that 114, Houston. 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John parked the Rover on a northerly heading and, while
Charlie waits for John to get seated, he has a good view to the
north.]</i></blockquote>

<b>168:44:33</b> Duke: That Smoky Mountain is a steep-sided mountain, Tony.

I've got a good view of Ravine here, and it's steep sided on the Smoky
Mountain side (meaning the north wall and rim), but very undulating on the
other side.  On the Cayley side (meaning the south rim).  And you can see
Cat Crater, and it doesn't look very blocky, so I guess it's
probably...It's sharper than the rest, but it's still no blocks around
it.<p>

<b>168:45:14</b> Young: Okay, 1, 2.  (Pause)  Uh-oh.<p>

<b>168:45:26</b> Duke: What?<p>

<b>168:45:27</b> Young: I didn't shut off the TV.<p>

<b>168:45:28</b> Duke: I did.  I got it for you.<p>

<b>168:45:29</b> Young: Did you get?<p>

<b>168:45:30</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>168:45:31</b> Young: In PMW-1?<p>

<b>168:45:32</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>168:45:33</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>168:45:34</b> England: Charlie, if you haven't gotten on yet, we'd like
to change that to 12 frames.  Evidently, your DAC is about out of
electrical power.<p>

<b>168:45:42</b> Duke: Okay, it's going at 12.<p>

<b>168:45:46</b> England: Okay, fine.<p>

<b>168:45:50</b> Duke: I'll start it when we get started, but it's on
12.<p>

<b>168:45:54</b> England: Good show.<p>

<b>168:45:56</b> Duke: f/4.<p>

<b>168:45:57</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>168:46:00</b> Duke: Oh boy, Tony.  This has been a good traverse up
here...<p>

<b>168:46:06</b> England: It sure looked good down here, I'll tell you.<p>

<b>168:46:08</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony) some spectacular scenery.<p>

<b>168:46:09</b> England: I'm sure glad we got this EVA-3...<p>

<b>168:46:11</b> Duke: Hope we picked up the right rocks.  I think there
are two predominant types.  (Stops to listen)  Yeah, me too.  But there's
two predominant-type rocks here, the aphanitic black-looking ones that
really appear to be crystalline to me, and not necessarily lava like.
