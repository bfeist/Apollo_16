<b>170:23:55</b> Young: Houston, the problem, as you must know, with (parking the Rover at) 085 at 0.1 (as per checklist) is that  such a reading puts us through a crater that's about 18, 20 feet deep, and it's too steep to climb in and out of.  (Pause)<p>

<b>170:24:28</b> Duke: (To himself) Rats.  (Pause)<p>

<b>170:24:31</b> England: How far is it to the other side of it, John?<p>

<b>170:24:39</b> Young: It's...Oh, it's only a couple of feet.  We'll get here at 085 at 100 meters.<p>

<b>170:24:48</b> England: Okay.  That'll be fine.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[We can hear Charlie breathing as he takes equipment up the ladder to the porch.]</i></blockquote><p>

<b>170:24:57</b> Young: Something on here has reset the range.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>170:25:30</b> Duke: Okay.  One bag is up, Tony.<p>

<b>170:25:32</b> England: Okay.  Did you see the number on that?  (Pause)  Don't go back to look...<p>

<b>170:25:40</b> Duke: I'm sorry I didn't.  6 or 7.  We got 6 and 4 down here.<p>

<b>170:25:46</b> England: Okay.  It must have been 7.<p>

<b>170:25:51</b> Duke: Thank you (for the reminder).  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>170:26:14</b> England: And, Charlie;  understand you got the Muley rock and put it in the big rock bag?<p>

<b>170:26:20</b> Duke: John did.  Rog.<p>

<b>170:26:22</b> England: Okay.  (Long Pause)  And, John;  once you get parked out there, we're going to need that whole front end brushed off.  If you just want to start on the panel and work back, that's probably the best way.  We'd like you to use the...<p>

<b>170:26:51</b> Young: Understand.<p>

<b><a name="1702653">170:26:53</a></b> England: Okay, we'd like you to use the small <a href="../alsj-lensbrush.html" target="new">lens brush</a> on the &quot;gotcha&quot; lens.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The &quot;gotcha lens&quot; is, of course, the TV camera lens.  Journal Contributor John Pfannerstill notes that the acronym for the Ground Controlled Television Assembly, GTCA, was commonly pronounced &quot;gothcha&quot;.  In 2000 correspondence, Tony confirms that his use of &quot;gotcha&quot; was probably a play on both the acronym and the crew's feeling that the TV was watching them whenever they made a mistake.]</i></blockquote>

<b>170:27:09</b> Young: Okay, Houston.  I'm parked on a slope of about 10 degrees - or 5 or 6 or 7 degrees - (with the downslope) toward the lunar module, and it's my guess that this will help your cooling some, because it (meaning the Rover radiator)'s looking towards deep space a little.  And I'm about 100 yards (90 meters) directly aft of the lunar module.  Is that where you want this contraption to be?  (Pause)<p>

<b>170:27:44</b> England: Okay.  It's heading 165.<p>

<b>170:27:49</b> Duke: Yep.  Heading is 165.

<blockquote><i>[An <a href="../alsj-LRVFinalParking.html" target="new">analysis</a> of mission photographs of the LM taken here at the final parking place and elsewhere indicates that the Rover is a bit closer than John's estimate and is about 81 meters from the LM.]</i></blockquote>

<b>170:27:51</b> England: Okay.  Fine.  And before you turn it off, there, we'd like a complete readout.  (Pause)<p>

<b>170:28:11</b> Young: Okay.  I don't want to do any unnecessary brushing.  How about somebody reading the EVA Closeout decal to me.  This thing is so dusty, I can't read anything.  (Going ahead with the <a href="../LRV-panel.jpg" title="image" target="new">instrument readouts</a>) Amp-hours...(Starting over in the usual order)  Well, bearing is 243, which can't be right; distance (driven) 11.4;  range 0.2.  Amp-hours (remaining) is 28, and 120 on 2; and amps, of course, are off-scale low (because no power is being used).  (Pause)  Volts are 65, 65.  Forward and rear motor temps are off-scale low.  And, of course, battery 1 is off-scale low;  and battery 2 is reading 143.<p>

<b>170:29:17</b> England: Okay, we copy that; 43.<p>

<b>170:29:21</b> Young: That do it, Houston, for you?<p>

<b>170:29:22</b> England: Right.

<blockquote><i>[On Apollo 16, John and Charlie drove 26.7 km and used 98.2 Ah, for an average of 3.67.  This figure is much higher than usage during Apollos 15 and 17, which  was 1.67 and 1.59 amp-hours/km, respectively.  However, the Apollo 16 Mission report indicates that abnormal drainage from Battery 1 was noted during EVA-2. John and Charlie don't give regular amp-hour readings but the few we have indicate big drops during both EVA-2 and EVA-3.]</i></blockquote>

<b>170:29:25</b> Young: Okay, now.  How about reading the Closeout decal to me there, because I can't see it for the dust.  Even after I brush it, I can't see it.<p>

<b>170:29:33</b> England: Okay.  The closeout.  &quot;Circuit breakers all open except Auxiliary.  Bus A and C should be Closed.&quot;  (Pause)<p>

<b>170:29:54</b> Duke: Okay, Tony;  I've got two bags up, and I'm gonna have to wait and let John take in the rest, and I'm policing up the area, and it looks like everything (disposable) is pretty much under the LM.<p>

<b>170:30:08</b> England: Okay.  And, John,  Auxiliary Circuit Breaker Bypass, On.<p>

<b>170:30:16</b> Young: Okay.  Wait a second here.<p>

<b>170:30:17</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>170:30:22</b> Young: Okay.  The Bypass switch is coming On.<p>

<b>170:30:25</b> England: Okay.  <a href="../alsj-LCRU.html" target="new">LCRU</a> Power, External; and Mode 3, TV Remote.<p>

<b>170:30:37</b> Young: Okay.  Let me line up the high gain.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b><a name="1703052">170:30:52</a></b> England: And, John, while you're up in the front end, take the TV lens shade off.<p>

<b>170:31:01</b> Young: Take the lens shade off?<p>

<b>170:31:03</b> England: Rog.  Just take it off and throw it away.<p>

<b>170:31:05</b> Young: (Before he hears Tony's reply) What do you want to do with it?  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[A <a href="a16det18719.jpg" title="image detail" target="new">detail</a> from AS16-116-<a href="images16.html#18719" target="new">18719</a>, which John will take at <a href="#1704104" target="new">170:41:04</a>, shows the TV with the sunshield removed.]<p>

[Although the sunshield has not been seen in the field of view at any time, there may be a concern that it could get in the field-of-view and/or disturb the camera while <a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pans upward to follow the LM ascent.</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1703119">170:31:19</a></b> Duke: Tony, I tried some Max cooling there for a second, on this PLSS, and it really freezes you.<p>

<b>170:31:33</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>170:31:36</b> Duke: (To John)  Okay.  How you doing, babe?<p>

<b>170:31:38</b> Young: Trying to line the Earth up.  (Long Pause; Static)<p>

<b>170:32:05</b> England: Okay, Charlie.  If you're out of things to do there, why don't you go on out where John is and see if you can find an igneous or a hard breccia to put on top of that LPM.  Use his camera to document it.<p>

<b>170:32:18</b> Duke: Okay.  I'll do that.  I was just standing there.  I don't have a camera, though, now, Tony.<p>

<b>170:32:29</b> England: Okay...<p>

<b>170:32:29</b> Young: (Garbled), Charlie.<p>

<b>170:32:30</b> England: Just use John's.<p>

<b>170:32:33</b> Duke: All right.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[A <a href="a16.ascent1.jpg" title="image" target="new">frame</a> from the 16-mm camera mounted in Charlie's window during lift-off shows, most prominently, tracks between the LM and the LRV at the VIP site.  Charlie is running out there now and, later, both he and John will run back.  A running astronaut kicks a great deal of dirt as he goes, spraying it in a fan, primarily a forward direction.  This can be seen best in the video of Gene Cernan's work east of the Rover at Apollo 17 Station 4 at about

<b>170:33:05</b> England: Okay, John.  Verify that the circuit breakers you still have in on the panel are at Aux and circuit breakers A and Charlie (are Closed).<p>

<b>170:33:23</b> Young: Roger.  We're staying here.<p>

<b>170:33:30</b> England: Okay.  And if you have a chance to aim the high gain, we'll get our TV back.<p>

<b>170:33:35</b> Young: Aux Power is in, Bus A is in, Bus B is in, and the rest of them are pulled.<p>

<b>170:33:44</b> England: Okay.  We would...<p>

<b>170:33:45</b> Young: (Lost under Tony) circuit breakers (garbled) pull.  Okay.  Wait a minute.<p>

<b>170:33:46</b> England: ... like B out, and Charlie in, and Delta out.<p>

<b>170:33:54</b> Young: That's the way I got it.<p>

<b>170:33:56</b> England: Okay.  Fine.<p>

<b>170:34:03</b> Duke: Where's your camera, John?<p>

<b>170:34:05</b> Young: Right here, Charlie.  (Pause)<p>

<b>170:34:16</b> Duke: Okay.  I got it.  (Pause)  (To himself)  Okay.  A hard breccia or an igneous rock.  (Pause)  Here's a TV shade!<p>

<b>170:34:44</b> Young: Charlie, vector me in again.<p>

<blockquote><i>[John is asking Charlie to help him with the high-gain antenna alignment.]</i></blockquote>

<b>170:34:46</b> Duke: I can't do it from here, John.  Looks like to me you got to go right.  Or down, to you, I guess it is.  (Long Pause)  Okay.  This one looks pretty good right here, John.<p>

<b>170:35:20</b> Duke: Do you want this rock brought back, Tony?  That is, for the LPM?<p>

( <a href="a16a1703509.mp3" target="new">10 min 41 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>170:35:25</b> England: Roger.  We'd like you to document it before you touch it, and then when you get the LPM first measurement, we'll put it on the LPM, take a picture of it on the LPM, and then we'll get an LPM measurement of it, and then we'll sack it and bring it back.

<blockquote><i>[TV on.  Charlie is in the field-of-view on the right.]</i></blockquote>

<b>170:35:46</b> Duke: Okay.  It's a pretty good one, but it's too big to sack, unfortunately (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>170:35:51</b> England: Do you have a smaller one around that we can get in the sack?<p>

<b><a name="1703616">170:36:16</a></b> Duke: How about one a half-an-orange size, Tony?<p>

<b>170:36:21</b> England: That would be great.

<b>170:36:27</b> Duke: (Static fades)  Okay.  I'm going to get a couple of cross-Sun stereos is all.  Is that all right?<p>

<b>170:36:32</b> England: That's fine.  We've got the (sample) location on TV.  And, John, when you start dusting off the panel, we'd like to...<p>

<b>170:36:39</b> Duke: Oh, yeah.<p>

<b>170:36:40</b> England:... reset the caution.<p>

<b>170:36:46</b> Young: Okay.  (Laughs)  Does that embarrass you?<p>

<b>170:36:48</b> England: No.  (Laughs)  It's just that you got a thermal leak there.<p>

<b>170:36:54</b> Young: Oh.

<blockquote><i>[With the warning flag in the raised position, the Rover instrument console will absorb more sunlight than normal.  As becomes evident in a few moments, Houston is concerned about keeping the console from getting too hot.]</i></blockquote>

<b>170:36:56</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  It's an igneous rock, not a breccia.<p>

<b>170:37:00</b> England: Okay.  Great.<p>

<b>170:37:04</b> Duke: And it's got that sugary texture to it.<p>

<b>170:37:27</b> Young: Hey, there you go.<p>

<b>170:37:28</b> Duke: Okay.  Here's your rock.<p>

<b>170:37:31</b> Young: Okay.  Why don't you set it on the seat, huh?<p>

<b>170:39:43</b> Duke: All right.  (Pause)  Okay.  The top and the driver's side is dusted. The left battery's dusted.  I'm going to dust the LCRU.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>170:40:12</b> England: And, Charlie, after dusting the LCRU there, you'll have to tear off one of those thermal blankets and put it over the control panel on the LCRU.<p>

<b>171:02:32</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  What's our time, Tony?<p>

<b>171:02:37</b> England: Okay, you've been out 05:31.<p>

<b>171:02:38</b> Duke: (To Tony)  Boy, you just hit it right on the nose!  There it (meaning the feedwater tone) goes.<p>

<b>171:02:44</b> Young: Okay;  fine.<p>

<b>171:02:49</b> Duke: Boy.<p>

<b>171:02:50</b> England: We'll be down (meaning &quot;behind schedule&quot;) about 10 minutes when you get in.<p>

<b>171:02:56</b> Duke: Okay.  I forgot to wind my watch, so that's why I was asking.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:03:10</b> Young: Okay, Charlie, this bag is coming open.  Wait a minute.<p>

<b>171:03:14</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:03:21</b> Young: Here's a bag.<p>

<b>171:03:22</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>171:03:23</b> Young: (Straining)  Let me get up on the porch [and] get it in there good.<p>

<b>171:03:27</b> Duke: I can't reach it.<p>

<b>171:03:28</b> Young: I'll get it to you.  Okay.  There you go.<p>

<b>171:03:30</b> Duke: I got it.<p>

<b>171:03:32</b> Young: Okay, here's the UV cassette.<p>

<b>171:03:36</b> Duke: I got it.  I hope that baby worked.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:03:42</b> Young: I'm gonna bring the ETB up now.<p>

<b>171:03:44</b> Duke: Okay, and you got a big rock bag on your left.<p>

<b>171:03:46</b> Young: Yeah, I understand.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Prior to climbing the ladder, John probably hooked the ETB to a lanyard (LEC or Lunar Equipment Conveyor) that he had left hanging down from the porch railing.  Now, he is pulling the ETB up to the porch and, in the next transmission, Charlie may be watching the operation out his window.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:03:52</b> Duke:  Get up there.  Go.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:04:09</b> England: And, John, verify you took the magazine off your (Hasselblad) camera.<p>

<b>171:04:12</b> Duke: Boy, you got that up fast.<p>

<b>171:04:16</b> Young: (To Tony)  That's verified.<p>

<b>171:04:18</b> England: Okay, and the UV cassette is in the ETB?<p>

<b>171:04:24</b> Young: No.  The UV cassette is in the spacecraft.<p>

<b>171:04:27</b> England: Okay.  Good show.<p>

<b>171:04:30</b> Young: I brought it up separately.<p>

<b>171:04:34</b> England: Okay.  We're all for that.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:04:41</b> Young: I'll go down and get the big rock bag now, Charlie.<p>

<b>171:04:43</b> Duke: Okay.  (Long Pause)  Well, that's the last of the old orange juice junk.  Just finished it.<p>

<b>171:05:25</b> England: Okay, we copy that.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:05:37</b> Young: Can't make the ETB (means the big rock bag) stay closed.<p>

<b>171:05:42</b> Duke: Huh?<p>

<b>171:05:44</b> Young: Have to take it up open.<p>

<b>171:05:46</b> Duke: What, the big rock bag?<p>

<b>171:05:47</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>171:05:48</b> Duke: It won't...There's no...There's some snaps on it, but don't worry about that.  We'll get that later if you can bring it up open.<p>

<b>171:05:54</b> Young: Okay.  (Long Pause)  Okay.  I'm disconnecting the LEC and dropping it under the LM.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:06:52</b> Duke: Okay, John.  After I bring this (big rock bag) in, wait 2 seconds and let me get behind the hatch and... (Pause)  I got it.<p>

<b>171:07:09</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>171:07:10</b> Duke: Man, that's a big rock right there.  Thanks, babe.  (Pause)  Okay.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:07:29</b> Young: Okay?  Okay, Charlie's getting behind the hatch, Houston.<p>

<b>171:07:34</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>171:07:35</b> Young: So I can get in that baby.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:07:43</b> Duke: Hung up on something.  Okay, I'm back as far as I can get, John.<p>

<b>171:07:49</b> Young: Okay, let me get my visor up here...(Pause)  See what I'm doing.  (Pause)<p>

<b>171:08:26</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)  Okay, it's clearing.  Just made it.  (Pause)  Okay, just about got it.<p>

<b>171:08:43</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>171:08:45</b> Duke: Okay.  Let me get my bum out of your way.  (To Houston) Okay, John's in, Tony.<p>

<b>171:08:51</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>171:08:54</b> Young: Wait a minute.  (Pause)  (Garbled)<p>

<b>171:09:08</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>171:09:09</b> Young: Don't close the door.<p>

<b>171:09:10</b> Duke: I forgot to turn off your feedwater.  Let me get your feedwater.<p>

<b>171:09:14</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>171:09:17</b> Duke: Okay, yours is closed.<p>

<b>171:09:18</b> Young: Okay.  Let me get yours.<p>

<b>171:09:19</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>171:09:22</b> Young: With his running out like that, I still have to get it, huh, Houston?  Probably 20 minutes worth...<p>

<b>171:09:25</b> England: That's probably a good idea.<p>

<b>171:09:26</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>171:09:31</b> Young: (Muttering)  &quot;Probably a good idea.&quot;  (Pause)  Okay, feedwater's off.<p>

<b>171:09:42</b> Duke: Okay.  Start with the post-EVA (procedures), John.  I think...<p>

<b>171:09:47</b> Young: Okay, Primary Water's off;  that's Closed.  Front hatch closed and locked.<p>

<b>171:09:51</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>171:09:54</b> Young: I'll get that.<p>

<b>171:09:55</b> Duke: Okay.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:10:11</b> Young: Okay, that's closed and locked, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[The next several minutes of dialog indicate that Charlie used the overhead <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a> to depressurize the cabin at the start of the EVA and he is now getting into position to put that valve in Auto.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:10:13</b> Duke: Okay, let me...I'll going get the...If you can scootch over just to the right just a little bit.  Let me get this dump valve.  (Pause)  Okay, we're in Auto.<p>

<b>171:10:31</b> Young: Okay, dump (garbled), Auto.<p>

<b>171:10:34</b> Duke: That's affirmative on the aft...(correcting himself) on the overhead.<p>

<b>171:10:37</b> Young: Okay, <a href="../lm_repress_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Cabin Repress (Valve)</a> to Auto.<p>

<b>171:10:39</b> Duke: Okay.  It is.<p>

<b>171:10:41</b> Young: Circuit breaker (16) ECS:  Cabin Repress to Close.<p>

<b>171:10:44</b> Duke: Here we come.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:11:00</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[A noise that sounds like cabin repressurization starts at this point but, because it continues long after repressurization ends, it must be static.]</i></blockquote>

<b>171:11:01</b> Young: Press Reg A and B to Cabin.<p>

<b>171:11:02</b> Duke: Okay, they are.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>171:11:17</b> Young: You got the PLSS Oxygen, Off?<p>

<b>171:11:20</b> Duke: Yeah.  It's Off.<p>

<b>171:11:28</b> Young: I think I got mine.<p>

<b>171:11:46</b> England: Okay.  You had a 5-hour and 40-minute EVA.  And the Backroom sends a great big &quot;Outstanding.&quot;<p>

<b>171:11:57</b> Young: Thank you.<p>

<b>171:11:58</b> Duke: Thank you very much, Tony.  They kept us going and thinking.  So, it was a two-way street.
