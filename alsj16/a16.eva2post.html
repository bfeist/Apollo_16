<blockquote><i>[John and Charlie are now doing the steps on Surface Checklist page 5-1 although, in fact, they are reading the Prep &amp; Post Card which has the same steps.  Because of the landing delay and the decision to do a rest period before EVA-1, they are about 18 hours behind the times listed in the checklist.  The NASa PAO commentator mentions that, although the signal is coming thru the 210-foot dish at Goldstone, it is very weak due to the fact that, in the effort to conserve on-board power, the signal is being transmitted with one of the LM omni antennas.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:01:25</b> Duke: Okay, I think the Cabin Repress is next.  Okay, and let me read the next step.<p>

<b>150:01:28</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>150:01:33</b> Duke: &quot;<a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">Dump valve</a> goes to Auto.&quot;<p>

<b>150:01:35</b> Young: Okay.  This valve goes open...<p>

<b>150:01:36</b> Duke: ... going on.<p>

<b>150:01:38</b> Young: Okay.  I believe I've got a water flag.<p>

<b>150:01:41</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>150:01:45</b> Young: It's probably because we turned the water off.<p>

<b>150:01:47</b> Duke: Yeah.  Okay, go ahead.

<blockquote><i>[The PLSS warning system is telling them that there is no feedwater flow into the sublimator, a confirmation that the warning system is working.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:01:49</b> Young: &quot;<a href="../lm_repress_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Cabin Repress (valve)</a> to Auto.&quot;<p>

<b>150:01:51</b> Duke: It is.<p>

<b>150:01:52</b> Young: &quot;Circuit breaker (panel) 16:  Cabin Repress to close.&quot;<p>

<b>150:01:55</b> Duke: Coming closed.  Mark.

<blockquote><i>[The sound of repressurization becomes audible.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;What did the cabin do when you repressurized it?  It was a pretty lightweight vehicle.  Did it pop and flex?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, you didn't hear anything. The only thing you could tell was the gauges.  You know you could hear it - pssssss, you know the oxygen going in - and you just watched the cabin pressure gauge and it started climbing.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And the walls didn't do anything.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, I'm sure they did.  I mean, they popped and they got
firm and there was probably some seating of the hatch, you know, and things like that.  But I don't remember any noises.  I know, when it's unpressurized, the Lunar Module was sort of like a beer can, it felt like.  But, when it got pressurized, it got very firm.  But it wasn't like a crumpled beer can that crinkled out; it just got firm.  You could hear and you could watch the pressure gauge rise, and that was about it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:01:57</b> Young: &quot;Master Alarm (and Cabin) Warning light on.  Verify cabin pressure increasing.&quot;<p>

<b>150:02:02</b> Duke: Okay.  I've got a water flag, too.<p>

<b>150:02:06</b> Young: I've got a water flag and an O flag.  Cabin press is up to 1.<p>

<b>150:02:11</b> Duke: Houston, we're repressing.<p>

<b>150:02:22</b> Young: &quot;PLSS O2, Off, at cabin greater than 2-1/2.&quot;<p>

<b>150:02:29</b> Duke: We got 2-1/2 yet?<p>

<b>150:02:30</b> Young: No.  I'll tell you when.<p>

<b>150:02:31</b> Duke: Okay.<p>

<b>150:02:33</b> Young: Okay, Mark.<p>

<b>150:02:34</b> Duke: Okay, I'll get yours.  (Pause)  I think.  There it is.  Yours is off.  (Pause)<p>

<blockquote><i>[The Public Affairs commentator announces an EVA duration of 7 hours 23 minutes 26 seconds.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:02:56</b> Young: (Master) alarm is off.<p>

<b>150:02:57</b> Duke: Good.<p>

<b>150:02:59</b> Young: (Garbled) is off.<p>

<b>150:03:00</b> Duke: I've got a press flag.<p>

<b>150:03:03</b> Young: Okay, &quot;Cabin warning light off.  Verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5.&quot;<p>

<b>150:03:10</b> Duke: It's there.  Yeah, it is.  It's there.<p>

( <a href="a16a1500313.mp3" target="new">10 min 31 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>150:03:13</b> Young: Looks like 4.6.  What a contraption!<p>

<b>150:03:15</b> Duke: Isn't that amazing?<p>

<b>150:03:16</b> Young: That's something else.  (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>150:03:17</b> England: Okay.  You guys had a 7-hour 23-minute EVA.<p>

<b>150:03:23</b> Young: Beautiful.<p>

<b>150:03:26</b> Duke: That's super!  That's a lot of fun.  Let's go back out.<p>

<b>150:03:31</b> England: (Hearty Laugh)  Tomorrow, Charlie, tomorrow.<p>

<b>150:03:36</b> Duke: I mean it.  I feel great.<p>

<b>150:03:39</b> Duke: (To John)  PLSS O2 Off?<p>

<b>150:03:40</b> Young: PLSS O2 off and...Okay, &quot;Cabin warning light on. Verify cabin pressure stable at 4.6 to 5.  Use purge valve to depress PGA as req'd (sic)&quot;.

<blockquote><i>[John playfully pronounced &quot;req'd&quot; (meaning &quot;required&quot;) as &quot;rickered&quot;.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:03:50</b> Duke: Mine's already depressed.<p>

<b><a name="1500352">150:03:52</a></b> Young: Okay, &quot;Post-EVA System
configuration, 15 minutes.&quot;<p>

<b>150:03:58</b> Duke: Okay, &quot;verify the EVA CBs&quot;.<p>

<b>150:04:02</b> Young: Yep.

<blockquote><i>[They will now verify that the circuit breakers shown as in
white (&quot;white dots&quot;) on Surface 1-4 and 1-5 are open and the ones
shown as black are closed.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:04:03</b> Duke: I got Suit Fan 2 and Suit Fan Delta-P going in (as
per the third and fourth lines in the first paragraph in the right-hand
column on Surface 5-1).<p>

<b>150:04:08</b> Young: Now where do you see that one?  Okay, Suit Fan 2
and Suit Fan Delta...<p>

<b>150:04:11</b> Duke: That's right after ...<p>

<b>150:04:12</b> Young: Okay, power-saving circuit breakers are out, and
the old others are out.

<blockquote><i>[John is confirming that the breakers are still out of the
systems that were powered down to save power because of the late landing
and extended surface operations.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:04:22</b> Duke: Okay?<p>

<b>150:04:24</b> Young: Why do those circuit breakers go in and out on you like that?<p>

<b>150:04:28</b> Duke: I don't know.  (Laughing)  Why do we do that every time (we get ready to go out and come back in).

<blockquote><i>[The obvious reason is that, while they are wearing the PLSSs, they can accidentally knock some of the breakers.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:04:34</b> Young: Okay, it says &quot;ECS caution and water SEP lights out&quot;.  That's true.  &quot;Suit Fan Delta-P, close.  Doff gloves, stow on comm panel.&quot;<p>

<b>150:04:43</b> Duke: Okay!  (Long Pause)  Must admit my finger's a little tired, though.  Just a skosh.  Could you turn up your A-9 numerics lighting when you get a chance, John?  Let's look at the caution panel.  Okay.  That's good.  We're in good shape.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;You also had quite a bit of forearm fatigue after that first EVA.  How about here?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Same.  (And) my fingers were a little bit sore.  They did get sore and (I had) the forearm fatigue, just like the first
EVA.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:05:53</b> Duke: Okay.  My gloves are off.  You need some help?  You got yours, huh?<p>

<b>150:05:56</b> Young: Yep.<p>

<b><a name="1500556">150:05:56</a></b> England: And, John.  That OPS latch on Charlie's OPS may
be hot to touch since that cover was up.<p>

<b>150:06:07</b> Young: Let me see.  (Pause)  Well...(Pause)  Okay. 
(Pause)  Okay;  It's cool as a cucumber.  (Laughing)  Thanks for your
thermal-dynamicist's advice.<p>

<b>150:06:43</b> England: So much for a thermal analysis.<p>

<b>150:06:47</b> Young: Yeah.  (Laughing) It's about 72 degrees F on the
top of that thing.<p>

<b>150:06:52</b> Duke: (To John) Okay.  Go ahead.<p>

<b>150:06:56</b> Young: It's hard working from absolute zero.<p>

<b>150:07:02</b> Duke: Okay, &quot;Descent Water's Open.  Remove...&quot; 
We're right here.<p>

<b>150:07:07</b> Young: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[They probably removed the helmets while John was joking
with Tony.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:07:09</b> Duke: Okay, &quot;purge valves...&quot;<p>

<b>150:07:10</b> Young: Water's open;  &quot;remove purge valves;  stow in
<a href="../a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="new">purse</a>&quot;.  (Garbled)<p>

<b>150:07:15</b> Duke: I'm not either.  (Pause)  That (EVA) was fun.<p>

<b>150:07:27</b> Young: Sure was, Charlie.<p>

<b>150:07:28</b> Duke: Go.<p>

<b>150:07:30</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>150:07:31</b> Duke: Okay, &quot;disconnect OPS O2 hose&quot;.  Turn
around and I'll get yours.<p>

<b>150:07:36</b> Young: Okay, I got yours.  (Garbled)  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>150:07:55</b> Duke: (To himself)  The outboard one, huh?.  Okay, yours
is loose.<p>

<b>150:07:59</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>150:08:01</b> Duke: Okay, &quot;disconnect LM O2 hoses, red to blue and blue to red; PGA (diverter valve), horizontal.  Suit Flow;  PLSS Pump, Off;  and Fan, Off.&quot;  (Pause)  Wrong switch.  Okay, that's.   We don't...We'll bypass that.<p>

<b>150:08:19</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[By putting the PLSS diverter valve in the horizontal position, they will get some oxygen flow into the suit torso once they get connected to the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:08:20</b> Duke: (Grunting) I go to Suit Flow in the (garbled)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is probably trying to turn around enough that he can reach the <a href="../lm_suit_isolation_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Suit Isolation Valves</a> on the front of the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a>
cabinet.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:08:27</b> Young: We're supposed to have stowed these in there.   We missed a step.<p>

<b>150:08:30</b> Duke: Wait, wait, wait...Oh, yeah, we did.  Not that one.  We sure do.  I was thinking about EVA-3.  Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[A comparison of the procedures on Surface 5-1 with the post-EVA-3 procedures on 7-1 and with the post-jettison procedures on 7-4 does not suggest an explanation for Charlie's statement.  Evidently, they have not properly stowed their OPS oxygen hoses.  There is no discussion of the skipped step in the Technical Debrief.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:08:45</b> Young: Thank you.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>150:09:18</b> Duke: Houston, the lunar dust smells like gunpowder. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>150:09:27</b> England: We copy that, Charlie.<p>

<b>150:09:31</b> Duke: Really, really a strong odor to it.<p>

<b>150:09:36</b> England: Yeah, remember on hammering on rocks, fresh rock
powder does have a strong odor.<p>

<b>150:09:47</b> Duke: I hope it's not the (LM) oxygen (supply) that has the peculiar odor.  But it goes away after a little while but...<p>

<b>150:09:53</b> Young: Well, you can bet this Moon has been hammered on.  That's for sure.<p>

<b>150:09:58</b> Duke: But it is really a strong smell.<p>

<b>150:10:03</b> Young: Boy, I'll tell you.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Do you have any idea what you meant by 'Hope it's not the oxygen'?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, it could be an oxygen contamination and, when we repressurized, if it was (ECS) oxygen contamination, the odor could have been in the oxygen and not from the dust.  So we were hoping, you know, we didn't have any contaminated oxygen.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:10:06</b> England: Okay, and we need a <a href="../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Cabin Gas Return Valve</a>, Open.<p>

<b>150:10:11</b> Duke: Okay.  Stand by.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[As per Surface 4-5, they had put the Cabin Gas Return valve into the Egress position prior to the EVA and hadn't planned to change it until they got to the last paragraph on Surface 5-4.  Houston may be trying to clean some of the dust out of the air that is producing the gunpowder smell.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>150:10:16</b> Duke: Okay.  Right now, we're in a <a href="../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Suit Gas Diverter (Valve)</a> Pull-Egress;  Cabin Gas Return is Open; and my (Suit) Flow is On and John's is in Disconnect.  Do you want us to go to Push-Cabin?<p>

<b>150:10:33</b> England: That's affirmative.  Push-Cabin.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is asking if he should change to Suit Gas Diverter Valve, too.  Prior to the EVA, they put the Suit Gas Diverter valve to Pull-Egress.  As indicated in the accompanying ECS 
<a href="../ecs.grumman_ec8.jpeg" target="new">schematic</a>, by opening the <a href="../lm_cabin_gas_return_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Cabin Gas Return Valve</a>, Charlie was letting oxygen flow from the cabin into the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a>.  To complete the circuit, he needed to open the <a href="../lm_suit_gas_diverter_valve.jpg" title="image" target="new">Suit Gas Diverter Valve</a> to let oxygen flow from the ECS into the Cabin.  Had he not opened it, oxygen still would have flowed into the cabin, but by going into the suits and then out the neckrings.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:10:37</b> Duke: Okay.  You got it.  Feels nice and cool.  Sorry about that step, John.<p>

<b>150:10:48</b> Young: Well, it's my fault.<p>

<b>150:10:51</b> Duke: (Pointing at the Prep &amp; Post Card) Okay, we got this, we got that, (garbled)<p>

<b>150:10:54</b> Young: (Garbled)<p>

<b>150:10:57</b> Duke: You're cutting out now.  &quot;Disconnect PLSS H2O
from PGA; connect LM.&quot;<p>

<b>150:11:04</b> Young: There you go.<p>

<b>150:11:05</b> Duke: That sounds like a good deal.<p>

<b>150:11:06</b> Young: (Eager to get cooling) Now that's just one step
right there.<p>

<b>150:11:08</b> Duke: The trouble is, yours is back under the rock box right now.  (John laughs)  There you go.

<blockquote><i>[This statement confirms that Charlie put the rock box on the Ascent Engine cover when John passed it in and hasn't yet moved it out of the way.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:11:17</b> Duke: Ah, that was great fun.  (Long Pause)  Never seen anybody sneak as nice.<p>

<b>150:11:35</b> Young: (Hearty Laugh)

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to John's sneaking up on a boulder at
Station 9 to collect a Contact Soil Sample.  See the discussion following
<a href="a16.sta9.html#1475704" target="new">147:57:04</a> in the Station 9
portion of the transcript.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:11:37</b> Duke: I don't think you got anything on that Beta-cloth
one.

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to one of two sampler heads John used
in the experiment.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It seems to me that you two had a tremendous amount of fun
doing this.  And I think most of the crews did.  Neil and Buzz, maybe
because of the pressure of the moment or their personalities didn't joke
and laugh and marvel at it quite so much.  From my point of view, it's a
little bit of a shame that that was the case on Apollo 11 because a lot of
people only watched 11 and never became aware of how much fun it
was.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  We just enjoyed ourselves
and we wanted everybody to share in that.  And that's just the way John and
I trained and our personalities were that way and we kidded back and forth
a lot.  He's really a funny guy and he likes to have fun.  I mean, you
first meet him and you think he's dead serious, dead pan.  When you get to
know him, he's really a fun-loving guy.  He's got a great sense of humor. 
And I like that; so we just worked real well together.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Do you look back on it as fun experience?&quot;]<p>

[Duke  - &quot;Oh, yeah.  I don't believe I could have flown with anybody that I had more fun with than John.  On the backup (crew) for 17, we would have had a great crew;  it would have been John and me and Stu Roosa.  Stu's like we are and it would have just been a ball.  We didn't ever get to fly together, but we had fun training.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:11:40</b> Young: Yeah, I'll tell you.  That's a problem you have to face with it (meaning the Contact Soil Sampler).  You know you don't set it down very hard.<p>

<b>150:11:47</b> Duke: Have you got yours hooked up yet?  Your water?<p>

<b>150:11:50</b> Young: Yep.<p>

<b>150:11:51</b> Duke: Okay, I gave us some water (by briefly closing the LCG Pump breaker).

<blockquote><i>[Next, they will get hooked up to LM comm as per Surface 5-2.]</i></blockquote>

<b>150:11:52</b> Young: Okay.  (Reading) &quot;PLSS mode, 0, both; and Audio CB, Open.&quot;<p>

<b>150:12:00</b> Duke: Okay, did you get your pump Off (as per the bottom of Surface 5-1)?  Your fan and pump.<p>

<b>150:12:59</b> Duke: Okay.  Audio, Close.<p>

<b>151:50:31</b> Young: Okay, we'll do it.  Sorry we couldn't raise him.

silence, he don't hear.  You know Ken.<p>

you.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>151:51:40</b> Mitchell: Good show.<p>

<b>151:51:45</b> Young: You know, Houston, it would sure be handy to have something like a false floor to lay down in this thing, because we sure can't stand on the floor right now (because of all the dust).<p>

<b>151:51:56</b> Mitchell: You'd like a bath mat, eh, Charlie?<p>

<b>151:51:58</b> Young: Do what?  Say again.

<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You've got your suit off and you're still in your LCG and it's got those cotton socks sewed to the bottom of it; and the socks are going to get full of dust and, the next time you go into your suit, all that dust goes in with you.  So that was a worry we had.  It turned out it wasn't a big deal; but there was a lot of dust on the floor.  So we got the feet of the LCGs covered with dust.  And our idea was - and it says bath mat here - you know, sort of a little grate you could unfold and you could stand on that and the dust would be down under.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was there any way you could have cleaned up that
dust?&quot;]<p>

<b>152:12:38</b> Duke: Okay.  On the water, we were reconsidering the dosage.  It went down like a cool one (meaning a cold beer) after a geology trip, if you know what I mean.  There was about the same amount (or about 12 liquid ounces or about 360 ml).<p>

<b>152:12:54</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)<p>

( <a href="a16a1521304.mp3" target="new">11 min 06 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>152:13:04</b> Duke: Go ahead.  We're all ears.<p>

<b>152:13:07</b> England: Okay.  Discussing Station 4 here, we'd like your general impression of the rocks.  Especially the bigger blocks.  You described mostly breccias and white crystalline rocks.  Were there any others;  and could you just talk about them a little bit?<p>

<b>152:13:33</b> Young: Well, if we'd seen any that we recognized, we'd have told you about it.  I think the big blocks were just big brothers to the littler blocks.  That secondary that we were working up there was a classic.  It really was.  And the pan will show that.  Must have come from South Ray.  It had a great block land in the middle, and then the fractures...ran off into all kinds of little blocks.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is saying that the Station 4 crater upslope from the
Rover was formed by a big block that hit the site and then broke apart into
numerous small blocks.]</i></blockquote>

<b>152:14:04</b> Young: I think that's about the only rock that we saw. 
You know, we're not really sure.  It's our first guess as to what those
rocks are up there:  whether they're breccias or crystalline rocks.  I'm
sure you all know that.  But most of them were very dust covered.  I only
saw one clear crystalline in the whole EVA - except for the ones I chipped
away - and that was the one I picked up.  I think it was Station 5, or
6.<p>

<b>152:14:54</b> Duke: I think, Tony, my view is the same.  We had only a
predominance of South Ray ejecta all around.  Mostly some of the smaller
rakes (meaning rocks collected in rake samples) were given to Descartes. 
It just occurred to me that everywhere we were, there was a boulder field
of varying sizes and intensity and you could see eruptive force - you could
look back at South Ray - and you could see the rays coming our way and
spreading and fanning out as they flow.<p>

<b>152:15:34</b> Young: You know, it just may be that that South Ray Crater
is so recent it's mantled everything - or most everything - around here. 
You know, like we said about the rays at South Ray, some were white and
some were black rays and just a little layer of dust.  I didn't see hardly
a clear surface all day long.  I felt right at home like we were back in
the United States studying geology and everybody said the rocks would be
crystal clear.  Well, here it's all covered up.  And it is my opinion when
you hit one and got a cleavage surface, that made all the difference in the
world to a rock description.  But a person may not be able to do that
(meaning breaking a rock to get a fresh surface) often.  (Pause)<p>

<b>152:16:30</b> Duke: Does that answer your question, Tony?<p>

<b>152:16:32</b> England: Right.  And the Station 4, 5, and 6 area, you
mentioned that (at) 5 and 6 the surfaces got progressively firmer.  I
wonder, could you see any contact or was it a gradual thing?<p>

<b>152:16:51</b> Duke: No, we couldn't.  Just when we got off the Rover and
you felt it under your feet.  The softest spot was up on the top, at
Station 4.  Progressively firmer as we went out, like you say, went down to
6.  And you just noticed it when you got out.<p>

<b>152:17:10</b> England: Okay.  Understand.<p>

<b>152:17:12</b> Young: Of course, we were working in a couple of craters
on Station 4.  Right on the - you know - right on the rim of the craters,
where you'd expect it'd be softer, too.<p>

<b>152:17:25</b> England: Okay.  And Station 4, 5, and 6 also, we're pretty
confident that the rocks at Station 4 were from South Ray.  At 5 and 6 in
particular, though, was there any indication that the craters - either by
their orientation or from the secondary blocks lying around - that the
source was, in fact, South Ray?<p>

<b>152:17:51</b> Young: Yeah, I would think the crater at 5 was a South Ray
crater.  Although the rocks generally looked more rounded, maybe from a
different layer (at the South Ray site).  (Garbled) pattern, you should be
able to see that in the film, but the pattern of rocks were all in the far
wall, which was away from South Ray Crater.<p>

<b>152:18:14</b> England: Right.  Incidentally, the Backroom is really
impressed.  They are very excited about your choice of sampling on that
inner wall of that crater - I guess it was at 5 or 6 - and think that you
had a good chance there of getting real Descartes.  In fact, they think
they've got it in the box.  What they're thinking right now is that the
areas where you're able to kick up and see white underneath are (South) ray
materials.  But you didn't see that (white underlayer) at 5 and 6.  So, we
think you may have gotten Descartes there.<p>

<b>152:18:47</b> Young: Okay.  (Pause)  I'll tell you one thing.  If this
place had air, it'd sure be beautiful.  It's beautiful with or without air,
but the scenery today up on top of Stone Mountain you'd have to be there to
see and to believe it.  It's just dazzling.  And I hope it showed up good
on television...<p>

<b>152:19:15</b> England: It sure did, John.  We're really impressed.<p>

<b>152:19:17</b> Young: ...(Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>152:19:18</b> England: Hey, we have a bunch of questions we'd like to
ask.  But we're going to knock it off and let you get some sleep and we'll
try to pick your mind when you get home here.  But there's one thing on the
Rover there.  On the drive from Station 10 back to the LM, did you notice
that the Nav system worked?  Whether you got any distance (reading) on
there in particular?<p>

<b>152:19:40</b> Young: No, we only came about 25 yards (garbled)  I didn't
notice, though, to tell you the truth.<p>

<b>152:19:48</b> England: Okay.  Did the numbers go to zero when you reset
at Station 10?<p>

<b>152:19:54</b> Young: That's affirmative.<p>

<b>152:19:58</b> England: Okay.  We copy that.<p>

<b>152:20:03</b> Young: I tell you, that beauty is holding up like a real
jewel.<p>

<b><a name="1522009">152:20:09</a></b> England: Okay.  And we've lost one piece of...<p>

<b>152:20:11</b> Young: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>152:20:12</b> England: ...hardware here.  We wonder where SCB-2 went? 
(Pause)<p>

<b>152:20:23</b> Duke: Okay.  I emptied that in the SRC and it's on the
Rover.  We're gonna use it tomorrow.<p>

<b>152:20:31</b> England: Okay.  I understand you dumped it into the SRC
and the bag's on the Rover, still.<p>

<b><a name="1522028">152:20:38</a></b> Duke: Yeah, Tony.  It's just like we did in training.  You
pack those SRCs and I could never...I mean those SCBs (into the SRC) - and
I could never get the SRC closed.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is saying that, when he tried to pack the entire
SCB - bag, samples and all - in the SRC, he couldn't get the lid closed. 
So he chose to just dump the SCB contents into the rock box.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was the original thought to put the whole SCB in the rock
box?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  The SCBs would go in the rock box.  You know, you'd
just put it in and then close it.  But it would never close, with all that
other stuff....You could never pound 'em out right when it was full and get
the box to latch.  So I ended up emptying 'em in and not put the SCB in;
that way, you could just shove the little individual sample bags into the
corners and it would close.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>152:20:49</b> England: Okay.  Good show...<p>

<b>152:20:50</b> Duke: We started dumping the stuff...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>152:20:54</b> England: We were wondering if...(correcting himself) wondering what happened to the (unused) SESC that was in the pocket there, but it looks like we're in good shape.<p>

<b>152:21:01</b> Young: The SESC is back on the Rover.  I was looking at it just before we got in.<p>

<b>152:21:06</b> England: Okay.  That's the extent...<p>

<b>152:21:08</b> Duke: Yeah, that's (lost under Tony).<p>

<b>152:21:09</b> England: ...of the debriefing here.  Why don't you head on with your meal and we'll have your Flight Plan updates for the (MCC)-conference period.<p>

<b>152:21:19</b> Duke: Okay.  We'll do it.<p>

<b>152:21:27</b> England: And what our plan is:  we've got a lot of Flight Plan changes here - about seven pages worth - and we'll put them in your conference period and if we don't get them all up tonight, we'll send you to bed on time and we'll sneak them in the morning.<p>

<b>152:21:43</b> Young: Okay.  Tell everybody in the Backroom &quot;thank you&quot; and we really enjoyed it today.  By golly, that view from up on Stone Mountain is something else.<p>

<b>152:21:56</b> England: I'm sorry, John, our comm's pretty bad.  We missed that.  Could you say again...<p>

<b>152:21:59</b> Duke: Hey, Tony...(Stops to listen)<p>

<b>152:22:01</b> Young: No, I won't say it again.  I just wanted to say thank you to the Backroom boys.<p>

<b>152:22:10</b> Duke: Tony, I'd like to say the same thing. 
&quot;Thanks.&quot;  I think they did a great job and they kept us thinking
and on our toes and came up with the right suggestions at the opportune
times and thank you, too, for keeping us going.  It was a good job.<p>

<b>152:22:28</b> England: Hey, I went back in the Backroom after the EVA
and they're just ecstatic back there.  I know we didn't see exactly when we
expected to see (meaning evidence of volcanics), but we think you got
everything that we went up there for.  We're in really good shape.<p>

<b>152:22:45</b> Young: That Rover really...If you could have seen some of
the things that that Rover did today, you wouldn't believe it.<p>

<b>152:22:57</b> Duke: You just can't believe the ridges and valleys and
rilles, here.  I tell you, the local slope might be 2 or 3 degrees, but,
man, that Double Spot, whoever picked that place to land, it's the only
level spot around here.  Any place else, you'd really be in trouble.<p>

<b><a name="1522316">152:23:16</a></b> England: Okay, in about 50 minutes,
we're going to get the 210 here, and then we'll have pretty good comm, so
why don't you go eat now and do whatever you want, and we'll give you a
call when we get the 210 and see if you're ready for the (checklist)
updates.<p>

<b>152:23:30</b> Young: Okeydokey.

<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break]<p>

[Jones - &quot;How was the comm quality at the LM end.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No problem.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Because they could push it through.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  They could blast through the Moon, almost, with their
big antennas and transmitters.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;I was thinking, last night, how surprising it is to me that
the comm is so good when you're on the Rover, when you've basically just
got that low-gain antenna, compared to the LM omni(-directional
antenna).&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, the LM omni is what it is - omni.  It just transmits
out.  It wasn't actually pointed at Earth.  The antenna that we had on the
Rover was small, but it was directional.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Four pi (steradians) on the omni versus a smaller angle on
the low-gain would certainly help.&quot;]<p>

<b>152:59:33</b> England: Stand by 1.  (Long Pause)  Okay.  It's 2 hours since you started the original charge.  If your question is, can you go right ahead with the topoff, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;.<p>

<b><a name="1530032">153:00:32</a></b> England: Okay, Charlie.  Sorry; the problem here (is that) our comm is really bad.

<blockquote><i>[Very Long Comm Break.]<p>

[Although the comm is not good, it is not exceptionally bad and another factor may be the fact that, except for the time he spent in the Backroom, Tony has been at the CapCom console since <a
href="a16.eva2wake.html#1392252" target="new">139:22:52</a>.  After 13 1/2 hours he is probably tired, too.]<p>

[England, from a 1996 letter - &quot;I suppose that all of us were tired, but it was absolutely essential that I do all of the EVAs so that I would know what John and Charlie had seen and done.  The real challenge was to go home during the periods between EVAs rather than work with the scientists who were considering changes to the next EVA.  I did force myself to get adequate sleep and I don't remember being overly tired.  I am sure that we were all running on a lot of adrenalin.  Some of the (verbal) slips that
you might be seeing may have had to do with maintaining several
conversations.  Toward the end of each EVA, both the scientists and the systems people would have requests for the crew to do things.  Some items I could decide whether or not to pass up, but many needed concurrence of the Flight Director.  I would often be talking with them and then have to interrupt that conversation to respond to the crew.  I don't remember any details, but I wouldn't be surprised if I had messed up a few times in that
process.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>153:43:42</b> Young: Okay.  It's pretty hard to tell.  From where we were at Station 4 up at Stone Mountain, it looked like...I could see Double Spot and maybe we're just a little past it (to the west), but not much.<p>

[Additional detail is provided by the <a href="../a15/a15mr.htm" target="new">Apollo 15 Mission Report</a>, &quot;The food system on this flight was similar to that of previous Apollo missions with the exception that additional food stowage space was provided in both the CSM and the LM to accommodate the extra food required for a 12.3-day lunar mission. Prior to flight, each crewman evaluated about 100 available foods and selected his menu. The food was arranged in meal packages for the first 10 days of flight. Menus and supplemental food for the remainder of the mission were selected in real time from the food pantry.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;The inflight menus were designed to provide approximately 2400 kilocalories per man per day with 400 additional kilocalories in beverages and extra food supplied in the pantry. Thus a total of 2800 kilocalories were available for each crewman on a daily basis. On launch day, each crewman was also provided with a specially prepared and packaged frozen sandwich, a package of bacon squares, and a beverage powder.  These items were stowed in a pocket of the pressure suits.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;Estimates of the crews' food consumption, based on the onboard food log and the returned food, indicate that an average of 2801, 2372, and 2568 kilocalories per day were consumed by the Commander, the Command Module Pilot, and the Lunar Module Pilot, respectively. The crew commented favorably after the flight on the quality of the inflight food and the food systems. The new insuit food bars were used by both lunar module crewmen on the first and second extravehicular activities. They did not carry the food bar on the third extravehicular activity.&quot;]<p>

[In comparison, for Apollo 16, a 10.5 pound (4.8 kg) 'food assembly' was flown in the cabin and two 4.6 pound (2.1 kg) 'food assemblies' were flown in the MESA.  The total is 19.7 pounds (9.0 kg), about 4.3 pounds (2.0 kg) more than was flown on Apollo 15.  Note that the 'food assemblies' do not include the <a href="../alsj-DrinkFood.html" target="new">in-suit beverage assemblies</a> which, in the case of Apollo 16, each included a 32-(liquid)ounce bags of potasium-fortified orange drink, which was provided to prevent a recurrence of the heart arhythmias experienced by the Apollo 15 crew.]<p>

[Additional detail is provded by the <a href="a16mr.html" target="new">Apollo 16 Mission Report</a>: &quot;Menus were designed to provide a minimum of 130 milli-equivalents of potassium per man per day for this mission. Foods high in natural potassium
were selected and some beverages were fortified with potassium gluconate. The menus supplied approximately 2600 kilocalories per man per day. This value was based on the calculated nutritional requirements of each crewman.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;For the first time on an Apollo mission, a preflight and postflight control diet was provided to the crew. The purpose of this control diet was twofold; to insure that each crewman was in an optimum nutritional state prior to launch, and to facilitate postflight interpretation of medical laboratory data. The control diet was initiated three days prior to flight and terminated two days after recovery. In addition, food and fluid intake was closely monitored during the flight. Preliminary estimates of the inflight food consumption, based on crew reports, indicate that an average of 2150, 1408, and 1900 kilocalories per day were consumed by the Commander, Command Module Pilot, and the Lunar Module Pilot, respectively. Postflight, the crew commented favorably on
the quality of the food, but stated that they could not consume the quantity provided. They also stated that they had an inadequate amount of time to prepare and eat their food because the meal periods were continually interrupted and shortened by other activities.&quot;]<p>

[The available information indicates that the flown Apollo 16 weight of LM 'food assemblies' was 28 percent higher than on Apollo 15.  Although the average caloric allowance for the mission as a whole was reduced from 2800 to 2600  kilocalories, this reduction may not be representative of the food flown in the LM.  Most importantly, while the Apollo 15 crew consumed nearly all of their foodstocks and had overall caloric intakes close to the planned 2800 kilocalories per man per day, the Apollo 16 crew ate far less than their 2600 kilocalorie daily allowance.  Charlie's statement about there being enough food to feed 'the trojan  army' may say more about his appetite and John's than about the actual amount of food.]<p>

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;As somebody completely unfamiliar with this process, this all seems to be a very large number of changes in a complicated machine and system and, yet, I hear you just write it down and get the impression it all made sense to you.  Can you give me any sense of how they went about these changes?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, the kids were experts in the systems.  And it was a monumental job.  And, while we're out on the surface, they're changing everything.  ('They' being) the guys responsible in the support rooms in Mission Control and, also, the engineering staff at Houston.  And they've got contractor support (and) they've got simulator support.&quot;]<p>

[&quot;So, they would get everything in the configuration we were in and then they would power up.  First, they'd go through the systems to get everything on line, using schematics and stuff like that.  And then they would verify everything in the simulator.  And even with all of that, we found one or two little mistakes later on.  But I was really impressed, you know, trying to re-write all this stuff.  'Cause, I mean, these books took weeks to get published; and they were doing these changes in just a few hours.  The most monumental task, of course, was Apollo 13.  It was an emergency and it had to be right.  But (on Apollo 13), we just went through all the simulators and everything we sent up to them, we had tried out in the simulator to make sure it worked.  And I think, most of this they did in the simulator or, at least, checked it out in a procedures
trainer.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Now, what's the difference between a procedures trainer and
a <a href="../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new">simulator</a>?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;The simulator was actually a whole vehicle.  The astronauts
didn't have any procedures trainers.  But these people who were responsible
for those systems, they had a panel with switches and stuff, just sort of
an engineering mock-up, more than anything.  I wouldn't call it a
procedures trainer; that's probably a bad word.  And, so, they would check
it out on that - switch positions and stuff - and, most of the time, it was
powered up.  And, then, they would run the whole thing in the simulator
(and) make sure it was okay.  But it was a big task;  I was really
impressed.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Would there be dozens of people involved in this, between
writing down what they thought the changes were and then actually going and
trying things out.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Dozens.  Oh, yeah.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And all of them about thirty years old...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, probably younger than that, on average.  They were
young, dedicated guys and gals, who knew the systems and they knew how it
worked.  They could look at these schematics and say, 'Oh, yeah; we need to
do this and do that' to get it all to work.  And they just knew how to do
it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>154:14:48</b> Duke: I was afraid you would.<p>

<b>154:14:51</b> England: (Laughs)  Sorry, John.<p>

<b>154:14:52</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>154:14:53</b> England: They keep piling them in front of me.  Okay, on the broken CDR's OPS antenna, we'd like you to:  one, remove any of the sharp edges with the scissors and examine the entire length of the antenna for cracks.  And we'll give you time to dig that out.<p>

<b>154:15:26</b> Young: Okay.  The reason that it's broke is on account of I climbed in here with it open, because we're being rushed there toward the end.<p>

<b>154:15:34</b> England: Rog, John.  You're exactly right.  I'm sorry, I shouldn't have let you get so far behind.<p>

<b>154:15:41</b> Young: Well, that's all right.  There's no problem!  We had plenty of consumables, and where's the fire?

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;John's just saying, 'we have plenty of consumables, why are you rushing us?'&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;As in, 'everybody's rushing around, there must be a fire
someplace'.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  You know how it is.  'Fire! Fire!' And everybody's
rushing around.  So he says, if we've got plenty of consumables, why are we
doing that?  And you listen at the Flight Director's loop and the docs are
saying 'don't eat into the sleep period, don't eat into the sleep
period'.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1541550">154:15:50</a></b> England: Okay.  What we'd like you to do, as best you can,
a patchwork job on that antenna.  We saw about a 15 dB loss from you when
it broke.  And we'll probably ask you and Charlie to switch OPSs tomorrow,
because you're relaying.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[When John and Charlie are on the surface, only John is transmitting to the LM and Houston wants John to have the good antenna.  Charlie will always be close to him and won't really need an intact OPS antenna.  Jim Irwin broke his OPS antenna at the start of the first Apollo 15 EVA and there was no noticeable comm degradation.]<p><p>

[Prior to 1967, NASA had planned to have only one of the LM crewmen go outside on an EVA.  When that decision was changed, it was discovered that it would not be possible to easily re-design the communications system so that both astronauts could transmit simultaneously to the LM.  It was decided, however, that one of the PLSSs could serve as a relay station, picking up voice and data from the non-relay astronaut and then sending the combined voice and data from both astronauts to the LM.  The Commander's PLSS was modified to serve this function.  See <a href="../LMcomm.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 2</a> in &quot;Apollo Experience Report: Lunar Module Communications System&quot;, NASA document MSC-04031 by R.H. Dietz, D.E. Rhoades, and L.J. Davidson, 1972.]</i></blockquote>

<b>154:16:24</b> England: Right.  We'll give you some words on that in the morning.  But, if you see any cracks, we'd like you to tape around the antenna about three loops, it says, such that it covers the crack of about a half inch on either side.<p>

<b>154:16:24</b> Young: Three loops of tape?<p>

<b>154:16:27</b> England: Rog.<p>

<b>154:16:32</b> Duke: Okay, Tony.  The antenna is about a half inch longer
than the pen-lights that we carry, and it's in good shape except for a
little crack at the top where it broke off.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>154:17:08</b> England: Okay.  That crack on the end there, we'd just
like you to trim that back.  And, examine the thing down where it goes into
that connector there and make sure it isn't cracked down there.<p>

<b>154:17:23</b> Young: Okay.  We already did that, and it's not cracked
down there.<p>

<b>154:18:14</b> Young: First we've heard about it, but we'll do it, I guess.  (Long Pause)  Okay.  Tony, could we beg off on a PRD readings unless (lost under Tony but probably something like 'really necessary'.)<p>

<b>154:18:46</b> England: Rog.  It's my error.  The PRD's in the morning.  Sorry, John.<p>

<b>154:18:52</b> Young: Okay.  We got the suits piled one on top of the other, and it'll be a mess.  The bags are up around the legs.  It'll be a mess to dig them out of there.<p>

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;Were the PRDs in a suit pocket or
something?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;They were in the suit somewhere - I've forgotten exactly where - and we had the suits all folded up back on the Ascent Engine cover and it was just going to be a big deal digging those out.  I remember; they were inside the neckring.  There was the silk liner inside the suit; you just un-Velcroed that and there was a little pocket that they stuck in, if I remember.  So it was going to be a big deal getting them all
out.&quot;]<p>

<b>154:19:27</b> England: Roger.  Deke's standing here, and he said y'all
did a beautiful day's work, and he's anxious to see y'all hit the sack ASAP
(meaning &quot;as soon as possible&quot;).<p>

<b>154:19:37</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>154:19:39</b> England: And, I sure agree on that beautiful day's
work.<p>

<b>154:19:41</b> Young: Where's this MCC (Mission Control
Center)-Houston...(Stops to listen)  Where's this MCC-H conference at?<p>

<b>154:19:49</b> England: It's just over.  You just had it.<p>

<b>154:19:55</b> Young: Oh, I thought maybe you guys were going to the
Wheel or something.<p>

<b>154:19:59</b> England: (Laughs)  You mean you didn't enjoy it (meaning the MCC-H conference)? (Pause)<p>

<blockquote><i>[The checklist item &quot;MCC-H&quot; was a scheduled opportunity for extra discussions with Houston but, in reality, it was usually just padding in the timeline that could be dropped if the crew was running behind.]<p>

[The following is from a 1997 exchange of e-mail.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;One of our eagle-eyed Contributors, Brian Lawrence, suggested that the Wheel might be local hangout.  If so, what do you remember about it?  Is it a place you might have gone with John and others during training, say after a long day of sims?&quot;]<p>

[England - &quot;The Wheel - maybe it was Singing Wheel or Swinging Wheel - was a Country-and-Western type place near JSC.  I didn't go there more than a couple of times, so I don't remember very much about it.  John hardly ever joined others after work; but Charlie, the backup crew, the trainers, any visiting scientists, and I often went out for a beer if we were on travel  - but not in Houston.  We didn't socialize that much when we were in Houston.  When we were home, most of us wanted to take advantage of it.&quot;]<p>

[Journal Contributor Chris Gainor notes that Gene Kranz discusses the Singing Wheel on page 152 of his book </i>Failure is Not an Option<i>, providing a description and indicating that it was a hangout for Gemini-Apollo-era flight controllers.]<p>

[Sy Liebergot, one of the veteran flight controllers, discusses the Singing Wheel at some length - pages 87-89 and elsewhere - in his excellent book with David Harland, &quot;Apollo EECOM: Journey of a Lifetime&quot;, and mentions that, of the astronauts, only Jack Schmitt, Charlie Duke, and Fred Haise frequently joined the flight controllers at their favorite hangout.]</i></blockquote>

<b>154:20:11</b> Young: I would be interested in what our EVA is gonna look
like for tomorrow.  Maybe I was off comm and you told Charlie or
something.<p>

<b>154:20:23</b> England: No.  We haven't said anything about it.  The
planners will be back working on it.  I can tell you what it looked like
before EVA-2.  It was a 5-hour EVA with about an hour up on North Ray and
about 20 minutes at Station 13 and essentially the rest of the time back in
the LM/ALSEP area, especially east of the LM, there.<p>

<b>154:20:50</b> Young: Okay.  It's probably subject to a change, huh?<p>

<b>154:20:55</b> England: Yeah, it probably is.  You got a lot of good data
today, and that'll make them think about it overnight, anyway.  But I'm
sure everybody's sort of drooling about North Ray.<p>

<b>154:21:05</b> Young: Yeah.  I kind of feel like if we're ever going to
be able to sort this out, North Ray's probably the place.  Personally, to
be able to get down 200 meters is something we probably ought to do to see
just how complicated this thing really is.

<blockquote><i>[The North Ray impact dug out rocks from a depth of at least 200 meters and, because it is 10 km from South Ray, may have sampled a different formation.  Similarities and differences between samples collected from the two impacts will say a lot about the site.]</i></blockquote>


<b><a name="1542126">154:21:26</a></b> England: Right.  You're sure right.  But let's not think geology, let's go to bed.  Incidentally, we'd like to go to Low Bit Rate and Down Voice Backup.  I guess with a 210 we can't assure being hooked up.<p>

<b>154:21:43</b> Young: Okay, Lo Bit Rate and Down Voice Backup.  You got it.<p>

<b>154:21:46</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b><a name="1542147">154:21:47</a></b> Duke: Okay.  Tony, whose arrhythmias y'all want to look at tonight?

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to the heart irregularities seen in both members of the Apollo 15 crew, a condition believed to have been caused by potassium deficiencies.  Because John and Charlie are getting plenty of potassium, they are not showing abnormalities.  Journal Contributor Garry Kennedy notes that occasional problems with arrhythmias crop up in the Shuttle/Mir era.  In July 1997, during the days following the collision of an unmanned Progress supply ship with Russia's Mir Space Station, the mission commander experienced what were probably stress-induced arrhythmias and was sufficiently incapacitated that repair operations were postponed until a fresh crew arrived.]</i></blockquote>

<b>154:21:52</b> England: Okay.  Biomed, Left.<p>

<b>154:21:57</b> Duke: Yea!  (Static)

<blockquote><i>[This means that the Flight Surgeon wants to look at John's
heart and that Charlie can take his sensors off.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[This is House Rock.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;If I'm remembering right, you saw House Rock during the landing.  Could you see it from the spacecraft, here at the landing site?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, not from...I couldn't look out the window and see it.  When we pitched over and I looked up there, that's when I was talking about it.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>154:22:23</b> England: Okay.  We heard you talk about that.  I vote for it, too.  I'm gonna go back and talk to them before I go home.  We'll see y'all in the morning.  Good night.<p>

<b>154:22:33</b> Young: Okay.  Take it easy, Tony.  Thank you, now.  That was a good day's work for yourself.<p>

<b>154:22:38</b> Duke: Hey, Tony, one final comment.  We've been talking about that crater that we took a pan of as we spun around and...I said, looked like Big Sag.  John and I are leaning towards endogenic on that, and hopefully from the films that we got you might be able to sort that out.

<blockquote><i>[This is the feature they encountered at <a

feature.]</i></blockquote>

<b>154:22:58</b> England: Okay.  We'll sure take that in consideration.  I
don't know whether it'll affect tomorrow, but I think it's a good
observation.  We'll see you.  (Pause)  And, Charlie, we still have a Hi bit rate.  We'd like to go to Lo.<p>

[Jones - &quot;I don't remember if you talked about it in 'Moonwalker' or not, but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the mysterious thing about how Deke picked people to be on crews.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I think we mentioned it.  Just to recap, to me it's a mystery how crews were selected.  My suspicion is that Deke and Al Shepard, who was Chief of the Astronaut Office, got together and they picked the Commanders and the Commanders sort of looked at the pool of potentials and said, well, I think this guy ought to go, he's ready.  And this guy, etc.  And then it had some approval process it went through up the chain of command, which I don't know how much that was changed.  The only change I know of that
happened after the crews were announced...I mean, sicknesses, that's a different matter.  Apollo 13 had a change right before launch, but that's because the doctors just said he (meaning Ken Mattingly) couldn't go because he might get the measles.  But the only other thing was on Apollo 14; the backup crew was Cernan and Evans and Engle and Joe didn't get to go because they put Jack in.  And he hadn't been on a backup crew.  So that was a change that was probably done by management because of the nature of Jack's education background.  But even that was...They just made an announcement one day: that's the way it's going to be.  Everybody
salutes and says, 'Yes, sir!' And you go on your way.  There was never any politicking for missions, that I knew of.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Were there, in a general kind of sense, some people who came up to speed on the spacecraft systems and showed real
competence...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Or was it kind of uniform across the pool of
people?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, you never got in a simulator.  They didn't know.  You didn't have any tests; 'cause they only had a couple of <a href="../tnD7112Simulators.html" target="new">simulators</a> and the only people who ever got in the simulators were the crews.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Prime and backup&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;They'd have two or three missions working towards the beginning.  While Apollo 7 was flying, 8 and 9 were training and they were already picked.  If you weren't on one of those crews you didn't get in a simulator.  So it wasn't a matter of knowledge and expertise in the systems.  I don't know what it was.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Perception on Deke's part, I would guess.  Certainly,
everything that I've read that any of you have ever written says it was a mysterious process.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Still is today, to me.&quot;]</i></blockquote>
