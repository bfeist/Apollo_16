<b>146:43:23</b> Duke: And the regolith here, is firmer than up on Stone.  We're in a blocky field here.  Predominant (rock) size is 10 to 15 centimeters, but the biggest one is a couple of meters.  And you'll see that 12 o'clock from the Rover.<p>

<b>146:43:50</b> England: Wow!  That's a real boulder.

black maybe.  (Stops to listen)  Okay, you already see it, huh?  And beyond
that, there's a white one that looks like that big one that John sampled
(on the southwest rim of Station 1).  Think we ought to get one of those. 
Okay; pan's complete.

<b>146:44:11</b> Duke: (Looking at <a href="a16eva2LMP-15.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-15</a>) Double core, here, is first thing.  I think we're in the ray, so I'll just sample right out...Do it right over here.  (Static;  Long Pause)<p>

<b>146:44:42</b> Young: (Static clears)  Okay, Houston, you should have us now. 

<blockquote><i>[TV on.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:44:43</b> England: Okay; we sure do.<p>

<b>146:44:45</b> Young: What're you doing, Charlie?  (Pause)  Charlie? <p>

<b>146:44:49</b> Duke: What?<p>

<b>146:44:50</b> Young: What're you doing?<p>

<b>146:44:51</b> Duke: Stand by.  (Long Pause)  Tell you later.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie is urinating.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;You knew you had to go.  And I could never get started into
that urine bag - UCD (Urine Collection Device) - without stopping (and
standing still)!  Once I'd stop, then I could get going.  John, I think,
could...&quot;]<p>

[Charlie's phone rang at this point in the interview and we stopped while
he took the call.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You were saying that you had to stand up to urinate in the
collar.  Did the system work alright otherwise?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  It did.  It worked fine.  You had to be careful when
you rolled on the condom because, if it didn't get on right it could slip
off.  In fact, it did to me, one time, right before we lifted off.  I had
to go and it was...We'd been in the suit and everything, and I'd already
used it a couple of times on the last EVA.  Climb back inside and, you
know, powered up and got ready to lift-off and, a few minutes before
lift-off, I had to go again.  And you couldn't tell whether the thing was on
or off; you just started going and, when I did, 'Uh-oh, something's wrong
here'.  You know, warm stream down the left leg and ended up with a wet LCG
and a boot full of urine.  But there's just nothing you could do about it,
so you just go.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And there were enough absorbing materials inside the suit
that the urine didn't get into the air stream in zero-g?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No, it didn't (get into the air stream).  Well, I mean, you
had a little odor and it was soggy; but it dried out.  If I remember, the
LCG had feet - cotton socks - attached.  When you put it on, it was like
the old pajamas that babies wore, you know, with the feet in 'em.  So we
had these cotton socks that was inside the suit, which was a nylon liner,
which is not too absorbent.  But cotton socks were.  And then, the inside
of the LCG also had some nylon, and there was a cotton backing under that, so it sort of absorbed it as it was going down the leg.  And it turned out not to be a big deal.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;How about provisions for defecating outside.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, we had a big diaper with a very big absorbent pad; but
nobody ever used it.  I don't even know if it was ever even tested.  I'm
sure they tested it, but we never did.  It would have been a big mess, but
it would have worked.  It would have contained everything.  It was like a
girdle.  They called it the FCD (Fecal Containment Device).  It was like a
ladies girdle you pulled on and it cut out in the front so that your penis
could hang out so you could get on the UCD.  But this big pad was in the
back; and I'm convinced it would have worked 'cause it was just a big pad. 
And then, over that, you put on the LCG, then you put on your UCD and I
think there was maybe a jockstrap that went on, also, and it had a hole for
your penis and then you rolled on your UCD and then you buttoned that or
snapped it or Velcroed it to the jockstrap, I guess - I don't remember exactly.  But, anyway, then you had to hook the tube from the UCD into the suit so that, if you were trapped in the suit (because of a cabin leak, for example), you could empty this bag, 'cause it would only carry so much urine.  But it all worked.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:45:08</b> Young: Okay...<p>

<b>146:45:09</b> Duke: Okay, I need to get a double core tube.<p>

<b><a name="1464512">146:45:12</a></b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[When the TV came on, the camera was pointed aft over the left rear wheel.  John swings the camera around and cleans the lens with the <a href="../alsj-dustbrush.html" target="new">large dustbrush</a>.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:45:14</b> England: Thank you, John.<p>

<b>146:45:17</b> Duke: Agh!  (Straining) God.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[<a href="../Fendell-Bio.pdf" target="new">Fendell</a> pans left.  Charlie may be having trouble getting the SCB on the back of the Rover open.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:45:24</b> Young: Want (me) to get it, Charlie?<p>

<b><a name="1464525">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1464525.mp3" target="new">0 min 04 sec</a> ) <p>

<b>146:45:26</b> Duke: Yeah, if I could ever get the top open on those things.<p>

<b><a name="1464528">MP3 Audio Clip</a></b>
( <a href="a16a1464528.mp3" target="new">14 min 21 sec</a> ) <p>


<b>146:45:28</b> Duke: Okay, there we go.  There's an upper and lower.  (Pause)  Closed again.<p>

<b>146:45:41</b> Young: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit and starts a
clockwise pan.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:45:43</b> Duke: What did he say?  Didn't he call you for something,
John?<p>

<b>146:45:46</b> Young: What did you say, Tony?  (Remembering) Oh; he said,
&quot;Thank you (for dusting the TV).&quot;  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds John at the left front of the Rover.  He is scanning his checklist, probably looking at 
<a href="a16eva2CDR14-15.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-14 and 15</a>.  Fendell
continues the pan and John goes off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:46:09</b> Duke: How do you read, Houston?<p>

<b>146:46:11</b> England: Oh, you sound good, Charlie.<p>

<b>146:46:16</b> Duke: Okay;  thank you.  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>146:46:29</b> Young: There's a boulder over here we can split.<p>

<b>146:46:32</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>146:46:34</b> Young: You see it?<p>

<b>146:46:36</b> Duke: That one off to your right down there, I think we
could turn that one over.<p>

<b>146:46:45</b> Young: Yeah.  I think you're right.  I think we could turn
that one over, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;If I remember, they were interested in the
character of the regolith as far as cosmic-ray bombardment and other things
such as that.  And so, we were to get a sample of the regolith away from
that boulder - in the general vicinity - and then we were supposed to push
over the boulder and sample the regolith under the boulder.  Because the
assumption was, well, since the time the rock landed, it would have blocked
any of the solar wind, etc. (from reaching the soil under the
rock).&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:46:48</b> Duke: How about samples of those two?  That white one and
that big one on the other side over there?<p>

<b>146:46:57</b> Young: Okay.<p>

<b>146:46:58</b> Duke: Get a chance.<p>

<b>146:47:00</b> Young: Can I help you with the double core?<p>

<b>146:47:01</b> Duke: No.  Go ahead with what you got to do.<p>

<b>146:47:05</b> Young: Okay, well I can get a rake soil here while you're
doing that.  Okay?<p>

<b>146:47:09</b> Duke: Okay, I'll have to...Okay, fine.  I'll just have to take the scoop off (the extension handle).  Can you do that rake/soil by yourself, you think?<p>

<b>146:47:17</b> Young: Yeah.<p>

<b>146:47:19</b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[The double core is a one-man job and, apparently, no other one-man task was specifically assigned to John.  The Apollo 17 crew had a similar situation at their <a href="../a17/a17.trvsta4.html" target="new">Station 3 at Ballet Crater</a>.  Because the rake is
relatively unwieldy, Charlie is wondering if this is an appropriate use of John's time.  In hindsight, John's time would have been better used collecting individual rocks with the tongs.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:47:24</b> Young: Think so.  (Pause)  Okay.  (Looking at 
<a href="a16eva2CDR14-15.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-15</a>)
&quot;Rake/soil away from the boulders.&quot;  (Long Pause)<p>

<b>146:47:47</b> England: I'm just a little curious.  How near are you to the edge of this ray?<p>

<b>146:47:56</b> Duke: (The ray) goes in both directions as far as we can see. <p>

<b>146:47:58</b> Young: That's right.<p>

<b>146:47:59</b> England: Okay.  We can forget that one sample off the
...<p>

<b>146:48:01</b> Duke: Tony, the whole area is just (chuckles) covered with these rocks.<p>

<b>146:48:13</b> England: Yeah.  It sure looks that way.<p>

<b>146:48:14</b> Duke: Have you seen the rocks on the (TV)...(Stops to listen)  Okay, that's what they all are!<p>

<b>146:48:21</b> England: Okay; I guess we're just looking for a variety, then, in the boulder protocol.

<blockquote><i>[This is a reference to checklist pages <a href="a16eva2LMP-24.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-24</a> and <a href="a16eva2LMP-25.jpg" title="image" target="new">25</a>, which contain boulder sampling suggestions.]<p>

[Fendell finds Charlie at the back of the Rover.  He has the double core assembled and goes off-camera to the left.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:48:28</b> Duke: Okay, we can give you that, I'll tell you.  There's two big boulders at 12 o'clock that are going to be great sampling.  One of them is a rounded; but the biggest (boulder)...(finishing his description of the first boulder) and it's black.  And the other is white and it's very sharp, very angular.<p>

<b>146:48:54</b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[Jones - Is your '12 o'clock' relative to the Rover
heading?]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Right.  We were referencing it from the Rover.  And the Rover's parked south, as I look at it here on the video.  Basically, we're parked one-eight-zero heading, which would have put 12 o'clock due south.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Rather than being a 12 o'clock relative to
down-Sun.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Right.&quot;]<p>

[Fendell reaches the counter-clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.  Note that the rake is not in its normal position on the back of the Rover.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1464858">146:48:58</a></b> Duke: Okay, I pushed the double core in, Tony, about halfway up the first (section).<p>

<b><a name="1464912">146:49:12</a></b> Young: Charlie, I'll get a locator on you and a down-Sun (for the double core), too.<p>

<b>146:49:15</b> Duke: Okay, great.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Evidently, John is working east (up-Sun) of both Charlie's
double-core site and the Rover.  John has already take a cross-Sun
stereopair of the rake site, AS16-107-
<a href="images16.html#17527" target="new">17527</a> and 
<a href="images16.html#17528" target="new">17528</a>.  Note that he has planted the tongs to provide scale and a shadow.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:49:17</b> Duke: (Adjusting his camera focus)  Seven feet.  (Pause)  Eight.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds Charlie, who is taking a stereopair of the double core from the north.]<p>

[John's down-Suns of the rake site are AS16-107-

<b>146:49:41</b> Duke: Don't believe it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets the hammer out of his <a href="A16ShinPocket.html" target="new">shin pocket</a> and begins driving the double core, left-handed.  NASA photo 
<a href="a16.s72_33898.jpg" title="image" target="new">S72-33898</a> shows Charlie driving a
double core during training at the Kennedy Space Center on 22 March 1972.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:49:50</b> Duke: Ummm.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[On the third blow, Charlie hits a buried rock and makes no further progress.  He stops after seven blows.  He readjusts his grip and strikes the extension handle four more times but gets no penetration.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:49:58</b> Young: What's the matter, Charlie?<p>

<b>146:50:01</b> Duke: Not going in too well!

<blockquote><i>[Charlie delivers two more blows, shifts the hammer to his right hand, and shakes his left hand to relieve some of the stiffness.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;To get this double core, I'm using a hammer to pound it in.  I had pushed it in as far as I could; now I'm hammering it.  And I have to rest about every three or four strokes.  It was really hard to grab that hammer strong enough to keep it from flying out of your hand when you hit the top of the core handle.  And I would rest and relax the muscle in the forearm and then I'd grab it again.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So it wasn't fatigue in the shoulder...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was the gripping; because you really had to grip it hard to keep the handle from flying out.  A couple of times - and I'm not sure it's here - I actually dropped the hammer, it flew out of my
hands.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you run into rocks occasionally?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh.  And I think this is one of the situations here. 
This thing is not going in at all and I think that about one tube down we hit some rock.  I'm not sure I pulled this out and shook it out and started over again.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:50:05</b> Young: Pretty hard around here.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie takes the hammer in his left hand and swings at the extension handle.  He misses and the hammer slips out of his hand, hits him on his left ankle, and skips a couple of meters to his left.]<p>

[Duke - &quot;See.  I just dropped the hammer.&quot;]
</i></blockquote>

<b>146:50:11</b> Duke: Oh, rats.<p>

<b>146:50:15</b> England: That's all right.  I do that all the time. 
(Pause)  Usually, I have my thumb in the way.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets into position to bob down to get the hammer.  He drops down almost onto his right knee but can't quite reach the hammer.  He stands, gets ready, and makes a second attempt.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:50:32</b> Duke: (To himself)  Nope; cain't (sic) do it.  I cain't get down that far.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;In one conversation I had with John on the phone, he said that he had spent some time in the airplane trying to do this - bouncing down to make a dynamic grab.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  He probably did.  And, you see, I tried it here a
couple of times - to jump up and let the momentum coming down bend the suit so that I could pick up this hammer that I'd dropped.  I tried it twice, but I still didn't get low enough to get it. It was like grabbing blind, too.  I just never...You had to drop and time it exactly right if you got down low enough.  You couldn't really see your hand.&quot;]<p>

[For his third attempt, Charlie steps back, then steps forward, and jumps about a half meter off the ground so that, as he comes down, he will compress the suit more and get his hand lower.  This attempt, too, fails; but, at least, he is able to get back on his feet without difficulty.  Next, Charlie goes around to the other side of the hammer and tries to bob down on both knees but doesn't come close.  He goes off-camera to the right, headed for the back of the Rover.  See the discussion following 
<a href="a16.lrvdep.html#1192437" target="new">119:24:37</a>.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>146:50:51</b> Duke: Well, I'm going to have to go get the tongs...<p>

<b>146:50:53</b> England: Yeah, it looks like a good plan.<p>

<b>146:50:55</b> Duke: ...to get the hammer.  Tony, I don't think the doub(le)...(Stops to listen)  Yeah.  Tony, I don't think the double core is going to go in.  Do you want me to pull it out and shake it out and try another place?  I think I hit a rock...<p>

<b>146:51:06</b> England: Okay, yeah...<p>

<b>146:51:06</b> Duke: ...'Cause it stopped...<p>

<b>146:51:07</b> England: ...we'd sure like you to do that.<p>

<b>146:51:08</b> Duke: ...all at once.  (Hearing Tony) Okay.  That one just stopped all at once, so I think I did hit a rock.<p>

<b>146:51:17</b> England: Okay.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[During the following conversation between John and Tony, Charlie returns with the tongs.  He gets the tongs around the handle near the end but is unable to lift the entire hammer because of the weight of the head.  He then gets the tongs around the handle near the head and raises the hammer without difficulty.  He then plants the tongs in the ground.]<p>

[Some of the astronauts wore a device called a &quot;yo-yo&quot; which consisted of a spring-wound cable and a fitting that would allow the astronaut to attach the cable to a pair of tongs or some other long-handled tool.  The yo-yo housing was secured at the astronaut's waist and allowed him to have the tongs close at hand, without actually having to use his hands to carry them.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Did you wear a yo-yo?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah; but I didn't use it much.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Any particular reason?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;It was just a pain to jump in and out of the Rover with the tongs on and to buckle up.  We just didn't feel like we needed it so much; so we normally just left the tongs on its storage area on the tool carrier at the back of the Rover.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And I guess there are only a couple of instances in the video, so far, where it would have been handy to have the tongs.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;This is one of them.  I wasted a minute or so.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;That's not much.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:51:21</b> Young: Okay, Houston...(Pause)<p>

<b>146:51:26</b> England: And, John, on the LRV, do you know if you lost the rear steering as well as the drive?<p>

<b>146:51:36</b> Young: No, because I'm unable to see behind me.<p>

<b>146:51:40</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>146:51:41</b> Duke: We could give it a little test drive, John.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie extracts the core, shakes it, and taps it several times with the hammer to clear the soil out.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>146:51:45</b> Young: Yeah.  (To Tony)  I wasn't getting hardly any amps out of the rear.  I was getting some, so maybe that's an indication that I had rear steering.<p>

<b><a name="1465158">146:51:58</a></b> England: Okay.  Except a while ago...

<blockquote><i>[Charlie pivots the double core so he can look in the end to make sure it is empty.  He then moves west to a fresh surface.  During John's next transmission, Charlie pushes the core about six inches into the ground,  He then backs up and takes a stereopair from the north, AS16-108-
<a href="images16.html#17684" target="new">17684</a> and

And...But in the most, there's not much of that material around here. 
That's going into bag 411.<p>

<b>146:52:38</b> England: Okay.  Bag 411.

<blockquote><i>[These are samples 68515 to 68537 and represent a variety of
rock types.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:52:39</b> Young: Where you're away from boulders there's hardly
anything but soil.  Very few rocks, in other words.<p>

<b>146:52:49</b> England: Understand.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie strikes the extension handle left-handed seven times and then switches the hammer to his right hand and delivers seven more blows.  The first two of the right-handed blows were struck with the hammer's striking surface but, because this is such a small surface, Charlie stops for a second, rotates the hammer head ninety degrees, and delivers the rest of the blows with the flat side of the hammer.  All of the astronauts who drove cores used the flat most of the time because of its larger surface area.]<p>

[Next, Charlie uses both hands to deliver seven more blows and then hops
around to the south side of the core to continue.  Despite his efforts to
this point, Charlie has only managed to drive in one of the cores.]<p>

[John crosses the TV field-of-view from left to right.  Once he is out of
the way, we see Charlie swinging the hammer left-handed.  He misses several
of the next eight attempts.  On each swing, he is raising his hand up to
the level of the top of his helmet.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:53:26</b> Duke: Agh!  Oh, you dog!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[After three more left-handed swings, Charlie stops.  He
transfers the hammer to his right hand and tries to shake the fatigue out
of his left hand.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:53:35</b> Duke: Whew.  Taking a break!<p>

<b>146:53:38</b> England: Good idea.<p>

<b><a name="1465340">146:53:40</a></b> Young: Yeah, Charlie.  Slow down.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stands, resting, with his left arm up at chest
height and his right arm down at his side with the hammer in that hand. 
Because of the internal cabling system and the pressure in the suit, he can
leave his left arm upraised without having to use his muscles.]<p>

[John crosses the TV field-of-view from right to left.  He may have gotten
an extra SCB to use at the rake site.]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:53:50</b> Duke: Man, there are little glass beads all over the place
here, John.<p>

<b><a name="1465353">146:53:53</a></b> Young: And little places where
little white rocks seem to have hit, too.  I'll get a soil sample here. 
(Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie strikes a dozen left-handed blows with the hammer,
stopping every once in a while to adjust his grip.  He then delivers eleven
right-handed blows.  Several times he delivers either a glancing blow or
misses entirely.  He is making progress.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Was it difficult to get distance right?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, it was.  You can see I keep missing it.  It was hard to
swing a hammer in that suit; this wasn't the easiest task in the
world.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You're switching over to the right hand.  You're rotating
the head, there?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah; it keeps doing it on its own, really.  You couldn't
hold it tight enough to keep it from rotating.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;You want to keep the head flat, but the impact wants to
rotate it.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That's right.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>146:54:46</b> Duke: Boy, it is hard under here, Tony.<p>

<b>146:54:48</b> England: Right, it sure looks it...<p>

<b>146:54:49</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>146:54:49</b> England: ...but I can see you're getting it down.<p>

<b>146:54:50</b> Duke: (Breathing hard as he delivers three final blows) 
It's in.<p>

<b>146:54:57</b> England: Good show.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie stows the hammer in his <a href="A16ShinPocket.html" target="new">shin pocket</a>.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;It looked like you got the hammer back in the pocket fairly
easily - by touch, I guess.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;By feel.  Uh-huh.&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1465458">146:54:58</a></b> Duke: It's a little off vertical,

rock.  It's a two-rock breccia, with the matrix being blue to me, in this
light anyway (static clears and the TV signal is restored);  and the white

[Duke - &quot;Yeah, well, we had a lot of training.  The equivalent of a master's degree.  You know, we were able to recognize igneous and volcanic rocks.  Although most of our training had been in volcanics, we'd had enough training with the igneous to be able to recognize them.  But everything was so fine-grained, though, it was really difficult.  We never saw any big grain stuff like the granodiorites out in the Rocky Mountains.  But there was no question about it;  you were looking at a single, one-matrix rock, with no breccias in this case, right here.  And I think it was white because it had been shocked.

[NASA photo <a href="a16.s71-51605.jpg" title="image" target="new">S71-51605</a> shows John and Charlie training at Taos, New Mexico in 1971.  Journal Contributor Markus Mehring calls attention to the chest-mounted Hasselblads, which are identical to the flight cameras and which were used by the astronauts to practice taking pictures so that they could hone their ability to accurately set the focal distance and f-stop, and to properly aim the camera.  Pictures taken during these field exercises were developed and then studied by the crew to improve their technique.

[Jones - &quot;And there's certainly no doubt that, while John sometimes gives an impression of a good ol', slow-talking, slow-thinking country boy, in fact....&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Well, in our book (</i>Moonwalker<i> by Charlie and Dotty Duke), I describe that.  John sometimes talks like he's the good ol' country boy and just ignorant.  But he's not.  That's just the way his personality is.  He's extremely sharp and he has a tremendous engineering mind.  He was up on this; he knew what he was looking at.  It sounds like Elmer Fudd; but he wasn't.  He was really sharp.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;There are statements like this that make it very
obvious.&quot;]<p>

<b>147:18:20</b> Duke: Pretty friable isn't it?<p>

<b>147:18:22</b> Young: Yeah.  Bet it's shocked.<p>

<b>147:18:25</b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie cleans the tongs and picks up a third
fragment.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:19:08</b> Duke: John, let's put this other piece in another bag, because this one has got no dust in it at all.  Just hold that gnomon (meaning the third fragment), let me &quot;Zee&quot; this one up.

<blockquote><i>[Once John has the fragment, Charlie plants the tongs and seals bag 341.  The two fragments they already have were picked up off the boulder and, consequently, are clean.  The third fragment fell to the surface, got dirty, and Charlie doesn't want to get soil in bag 341.]<p>

<blockquote><i>[John kneels on the east side of the white boulder and tries
to push it with his right hand.  It doesn't move and he
stands.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:20:20</b> Young: Which way do you want to turn it?<p>

<b>147:20:22</b> Duke: I was going to push it (motioning toward the east)

<b>147:20:23</b> Young: Think you're right.<p>

<b>147:20:24</b> Duke: ...because we can get down below it.<p>

<b>147:20:25</b> Young: Wait, let's move the toolage. <p>

<b>147:20:27</b> Duke: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John grabs the scoop and plants it out of the way, about a
meter north.  The tongs are already north of the rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:20:29</b> Young: Here's a rock with glass splattered all over its

<b>147:20:32</b> Duke: Yeah, I see.<p>

<b>147:20:36</b> Young: Let me do that, Charlie.<p>

<b>147:20:37</b> Duke: No, we can both lift it.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John and Charlie are both in the depression and appear to

<b>147:20:46</b> Young: No way!<p>

<b>147:20:47</b> England: Okay, let's forget that one.<p>

<b>147:20:49</b> Duke: Budged once, but I don't think we're gonna do it.

<blockquote><i>[The boulder is about 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.75 meters and,
consequently, has a volume of about 0.19 cubic meters.  The rock density is
about 2000 kilograms per cubic meters and the terrestrial weight of the
rock is about 380 kg or 840 pounds.  The lunar weight is about 60 kg or 140
pounds.  Although these are very rough estimates, they suggest that, with
good traction and a favorable boulder position on the surface, John and
Charlie might have been able to overturn the boulder.  Certainly, at 
<a href="../a15/a15.sta2.html" target="new">Apollo 15 Station 2</a>, Dave Scott was able to overturn a boulder of similar size. 
Here, the boulder may be wedged into the side of the
depression.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:20:54</b> Duke: Tony, there's one off at the 3 o'clock position of
the Rover that I think we can turn over.<p>

<b>147:20:59</b> England: Okay, have at it.  And remember we're looking for
shaded samples and east-west cracks and all that kind of thing (as per
checklist pages <a href="a16eva2CDR24-25.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR-24 and 25</a>).<p>

<b>147:21:09</b> Duke: Yeah, well, there's nothing like that here.<p>

<b>147:21:11</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>147:21:13</b> Duke: Unfortunately.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie grabs the tongs and scoop and heads off-camera to
the left.  Fendell pulls back on the zoom.  John continues to examine the
southwest face of the white boulder and then appears to give one last try
at turning it over.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:21:27</b> England: If you see one with a better developed
fillet...<p>

<b>147:21:29</b> Young: (To himself) (Lost under Tony) you'll never budge
that rock (lost under Tony).

<blockquote><i>[John gives up and follows Charlie.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:21:30</b> England: I'm not so sure we got a good fillet on this last

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;John's coming back from the rock.  Is he
playing?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I think he's just playing.  Or he's trying to jump out of a

<b><a name="1472218">147:22:18</a></b> Duke: Okay, then we'll see if we can move it.  I don't

<b>147:22:41</b> Duke: Hey, look;  (it's) got a good fillet around it.<p>

<b>147:22:43</b> Young: It does.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell reaches the clockwise pan limit and reverses direction.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:22:45</b> Duke: Okay, let me turn (the checklist pages) over and see what that says (on <a href="a16eva2LMP-24.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-24</a> and <a href="a16eva2LMP-25.jpg" title="image" target="new">25</a>).  It doesn't have any dust on the top of it.  I thought we could get the fillet sample here, but it doesn't have any dust on the top.

<blockquote><i>[The idea is to compare the composition and exposure age of samples of soil taken from the top of the boulder, from the fillet, and from an area away from the rock with chips taken from the rock.  If fillets are derived mostly from regolith that splashes against the rock, the three soil samples will show similar compositions.  One the other hand, if the fillet material is primarily eroded from the rock itself, the top and fillet samples will be similar in composition to the rock and will be different from the soil taken at a distance from the rock.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:22:58</b> England: We don't need dust from the top.  If this is a better fillet than the other, you might take a soil sample there, and then a reference soil away, and then a chip off the rock, and we'll have a good fillet sample.

<blockquote><i>[Useful comparisons can still be made if the top of the rock is dust free.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:23:09</b> Duke: Okay, this is a better fillet than the other one.<p>

<b>147:23:13</b> Young: Okay, but I thought you didn't want breccias.  It's a breccia.<p>

<b><a name="1472321">147:23:21</a></b> Duke: It says &quot;crystalline or tough breccia for fillet sample&quot;.<p>

<b>147:23:25</b> Young: I don't know whether it's &quot;tuff&quot; or not.  You mean &quot;hard&quot;.<p>

<b>147:23:29</b> Duke: Yeah.<p>

<b>147:23:30</b> Young: Not &quot;tuff&quot;, huh?.

<blockquote><i>[Tuff is a rock made of volcanic ash fused by its own internal heat.  John and Charlie saw a great deal of tuff on their geology <a href="../ap-geotrips.html" target="new">field trips</a> in the western U.S., especially in New Mexico and Arizona.]
</i></blockquote>

<b>147:23:32</b> Duke: Yeah, &quot;hard&quot;.<p>

<b>147:23:33</b> England: Oh, we'd prefer...<p>

<b>147:23:34</b> Duke: Let's take it...Let's try it, John, okay? <p>

<b>147:23:35</b> Young: All righty.<p>

<b>147:23:36</b> Duke: We'll fill that square.  Okay, fillet coming in from this side.  There's a good one right over here.  Already got the
cross-Sun.<p>

<b>147:23:57</b> Young: My personal guess is that fillet didn't come off that rock.<p>

<b>147:24:01</b> Duke: Mine, too.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;The way I interpret this is that the fillet was mostly on one side, that ejecta from some other impact had splashed against.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah.  But, you know, it means it hit and skidded
in.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Ah!  Rather than something being thrown against
it?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Yeah. Or, it could have been the other.  You're right.  It could have been one or the other.  The rock hit and skidded in to a stop and dug in; or, as it was sitting there, an explosion blasting out stuff from another rock (impact) could have come in and hit it.  But it didn't have anything on the top, so that's...That (meaning ejecta from another impact) would have probably left dust up on the top of the rock, too.  And this rock didn't have it.  So it was more likely that, as it hit, it dug in.&quot;]<p>

[As shown in Figure 14 in the South Ray chapter of the Apollo 16
<a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">Professional Paper</a>, the fillet is on the north side of the boulder and, as author V. Stephen Reed writes, it &quot;appears to be old regolith pushed up when the boulder landed, rather than a fillet formed by rock degradation (which is a third means of producing fillets).&quot;]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:24:06</b> Young: (To Houston) 375 (is the bag number for the fillet
sample).<p>

<b>147:24:08</b> England: Okay, 375.  (Pause)<p>

<b>147:24:16</b> Young: Oh, Charlie;  wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Here, let me put this in your bag and give you a hand.  Turn that.  Got to get a rock off the top before we turn it, right?<p>

<b>147:24:28</b> Duke: No, they don't have to do that.  They want a chip off of it, though.<p>

<b>147:24:32</b> Young: That's what I mean.<p>

<b>147:24:33</b> Duke: Yeah.

<blockquote><i>[Fendell finds John and Charlie working ENE of the Rover.  They are just visible past the high-gain mast.  As can be seen in Figure 6 in the South Ray chapter of the <a href="a16profpaper.htm" target="new">Professional Paper</a>, they are about 33 meters from the second Rover parking place.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1472435">147:24:35</a></b> Young: Okay, let's get the chip.<p>

<b><a name="1472437">147:24:37</a></b> Duke: Okay.  (Pause)

<b>147:24:43</b> Duke: Okay, Tony, I got a footprint in (the photo for scale), but I'll put the spade - the shovel - the scoop, rather - will be right west of where the fillet was taken.<p>

<b>147:24:53</b> England: Okay, good show.  (Pause)  And we'll need a reference soil.<p>

<b>147:25:02</b> Duke: Yeah, we'll get it.<p>

<b>147:25:04</b> Young: Watch out, Charlie.

<blockquote><i>[This rock is particularly hard and John is probably worried that a chip will fly off and hit Charlie.  A chip hitting the suit at any plausible velocity would not cause any significant damage, but it could scratch the visor or, if it hit in just the wrong place, be
felt.]</i></blockquote>

going radially, Fendell is able to follow them by pulling back on the zoom
and panning slowly left.  Charlie is on the right, with the tongs in his right hand.  John is on the left with the hammer in his right hand and the scoop in his left.  Charlie slows his skipping stride to avoid losing
more bags and covers roughly 32 meters in 37 seconds, which is an average
speed of only 3.1 km/hr.  John started 3 seconds later, possibly so he
could watch Charlie's SCB, but arrives at about the same time.  His average
speed is about 3.4 km/hr.  They go off-camera to the left.]<p>

[In Houston, Flight is told that the crew could be given a 20-minute
extension of the EVA.  In addition, Jim Lovell, who is the Backroom
spokesman, tells Flight that they would like Charlie to take some 500-mm
photos of Stone Mountain.  These will give the photo analysts a view from a
different angle than the series taken near the LM and during EVA-1.  Flight
decides that, after they get the SCBs changed and the photos taken, they
should press on to Station 9.]</i></blockquote>

you're reconfigured there.<p>

<b>147:41:08</b> Duke: Okay; I was just gonna say (that) there's some good
crystalline...that white crystalline rock that we picked up there.  There's
some good fist-size ones that would make good padded bag samples. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>147:41:25</b> England: Okay.  While you're configuring, we'll work that.

(Long Pause)<p>

<b>147:42:06</b> Young: Oh, dear.  All those kittens with mittens could do better than this.<p>

<b>147:42:14</b> Duke: Isn't that terrible?  Isn't that terrible!? 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[John is referring to the Mother Goose nursery rhyme &quot;The Three Little Kittens&quot;, which first appeared in print in 1843.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:42:26</b> England: Okay; Charlie.  What SCB did you have on
before...<p>

<b>147:42:34</b> Duke: I think it was number 2.  Stand by. <p>

<b><a name="1474236">147:42:36</a></b> England: Okay.

<blockquote><i>[John has been working near the right rear fender.  Once he finishes with Charlie's SCB, he stands, turns to his right, and starts to move to the other side of the Rover.  As he does so, his right leg catches on the rear fender extension.  After a moment, the fender extension breaks loose and the rest of the fender snaps back toward its normal position.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:42:39</b> Young: There goes the fender.<p>

<b>147:42:41</b> Duke: Uh-oh.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie turns to look at the fender and then hops to his left to the gate.  Fendell follows.]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Looking at it again, John gets down low to finish up your bag, and it looks like he just catches it with his leg, or maybe the hammer if he's got it in his <a href="A16ShinPocket.html" target="new">shin pocket</a>.  There's a spray of dust that comes off of it when it snaps back.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;He caught it with his right leg.  And it popped back.  The
fender was made in two parts.  There was a part that slid...The part that
was fixed, that was attached to the frame in a couple of spots, that made
it very wiggly.  The mounting was not real stiff, so it could rattle.  And
there was another part (the extension) that slid down over the wheel, like
a mud flap...&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;On the back of this one.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;On the back on the right-rear wheel.  And what happened, as
he went by, his right leg apparently caught it, caught that bottom part,
that bent the whole thing and, when the bottom, mud-flap part broke loose,
the other snapped back and that threw off the dust.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;If I remember right, in </i>Moonwalker<i> you said that you
had lost a fender in training a time or two; and that you weren't concerned
about it when it happened here.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember exactly, but it probably did happen; because
of, you know, wear and tear on a training vehicle.  You know, operating it
every time we went out there to practice.  Things just got loose and we
weren't particularly concerned about it when it happened.  See, we didn't
even stop to try to pick it up and put it back on.  We just left
it.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And the dust up there on the Moon would have been more of a problem than in any training environment down here.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So you didn't appreciate how much dust the wheel was going to spray on you.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Uh-huh.  That's right.&quot;]<p>

[Ron Creel has provided a summary ( <a href="../LRV_Fender_Extensions.pdf" target="new">1.3 Mb PDF</a> ) of the fender extension losses that occurred on all three Rover missions.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:43:02</b> Duke: Okay; Tony.  We're gonna start sampling again. 
(Pause)<p>

<b>147:43:07</b> England: Negative.  It's time to go.<p>

<b>147:43:11</b> Young: It's time to go?<p>

<b>147:43:14</b> England: Yes sir.  It sure is.<p>

<b><a name="1474315">147:43:15</a></b> Duke: That was terrible, taking that much time (to change the SCBs).

<blockquote><i>[Duke - &quot;We've been around the Rover, now, five minutes or more, just changing out the bags.  It was really a frustrating and a time consuming and a very wasteful effort to change out the SCBs and break out the new ones.  Time is so valuable up there, we really should have put more thought into how we store the individual sample bags and what we do with the design of the doffing and donning of the SCBs.  And, in the future, you really ought to look at some sort of a quick disconnect and connect operation - if you're going to hang 'em on your back.  I personally think the best thing is a little shopping bag deal where you carry it around with you and make it broad enough base so that, when you plop it down, it just stays there.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;And then just have a little slot on the back of the Rover you can stick it in...&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;Or under the seat where you can just throw it in and leave it.  Or, when you get back, you know, have something permanently there on the Rover that, when you get back, you just pour everything in and that leaves you with the empty bag again.  It turned out it was very, very wasteful of time - more than five minutes here and we didn't get anything done.  We're just screwing around trying to get some fresh bags.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;This is the worst example of time taken to change bags, but it's not the only example.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;That's right.&quot;]<p>

[They started changing the bags at <a href="#1473438" target="new">147:34:38</a> and, therefore, spent nearly nine minutes doing what should have been - with well designed equipment -  a quick, simple
job.]<p>

[Charlie stows the tongs and the scoop on the gate.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:43:21</b> Duke: (Lost under Tony)<p>

<b>147:43:21</b> England: Well, we'll get the padded bags later.<p>

<b>147:43:24</b> Young: (Incredulous) We were out there an hour?  Been out
here an hour?<p>

<b>147:43:30</b> Duke: Tony, we've been here an hour?<p>

<b>147:43:32</b> England: Yes, you have.<p>

<b>147:43:38</b> Duke: It doesn't seem like it.<p>

<b>147:43:40</b> Young: Time flies, huh?<p>

<b>147:43:41</b> Duke: It sure does.  (Pause)  The old stop 9 (is next). 
(Pause)

<blockquote><i>[While Charlie closes the gate, John goes off-camera to the
CDR seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:43:52</b> Duke: &quot;Close&quot;, says me.  Ha!  It did.  We lost a
fender, Tony.  The pusher-downer fender (meaning the fender extension) on
the right rear wheel is gone.<p>

<blockquote><i>[The Apollo 17 crew lost the 
right-rear fender extension on their Rover at about
<a href="../a17/a17.alsepoff.html#1185120" target="new">118:51:20</a> when Gene Cernan walked by on his way around the
back of the vehicle, got his hammer caught under the fender extension, and tore it off.]</i></blockquote>

<b><a name="1474403">147:44:03</a></b> England: Rog.  Just like the trainer.<p>

<b>147:44:07</b> Duke: Just exactly!  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Jones - &quot;The dust will become much more of a problem with the fender gone but, do you remember if, up to this point, there were problems with equipment getting fouled with dust?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  It was more accumulation of stuff, especially our suits.  They got dirtier and dirtier and grittier and grittier; and it was harder and harder to get things locked and unlocked - the gloves and the helmet.   We tried to clean them up as best we could - the seals.  And we had these wipes and stuff when we took 'em off.  But it just got, you know, more and more difficult.  The long-duration stays up there, we're going to have to have good EVA maintenance.  Probably take some spare suits along, certainly spare parts: new seals and stuff like that.  We had a few, minor things, that we could do in repair.  But preventive maintenance of the suits is going to be very, very important.  As far as the hardware goes - and, by that, I mean the lunar experiments - certainly things got dustier and dustier, especially once the fender fell off.  And then, wear and tear on the stuff.  The gnomon, for instance, came apart.  It was a bad design.  John just pulled that out and the whole rod came out and left the tripod down there.  And that not only happened on our flight; it happened on a couple of the other flights, too.  Those kind of things - attention to detail and design.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;On 17, Jack had a lot of <a href="../a17/a17.sta8.html#1672022" target="new">trouble on the last EVA</a> with the 
<a href="../tools/judy45.jpg" title="image" target="new">adjustment mechanism</a> on the scoop head.  There were squeeze plates on the sides to change the angle of it; and those were getting pretty badly fouled.&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I don't remember that one in particular, per se, on our flight, but I did notice that the tongs got stiffer and stiffer as they got grittier and grittier in there, as the dust got in and began to bind up the spring mechanism.  The cameras: they continued to work but they were really getting dusty.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Hard to read?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;No.  I don't remember it being hard to read.  But, you know, I was amazed that the cameras kept working, really, because it was a trigger and it was electric motors and stuff like that; but I think the salvation of it all was the fact that the film pack had its own electric motor and the film pack never stayed (in the camera too long)...You know, we changed those out every couple of hours and that was probably the salvation of the thing, because the camera body, and the trigger were really getting dusty.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;So there were separate electrical systems for the shutter and the film pack?&quot;]<p>

[Duke - &quot;I think the same battery, but separate electrical systems; yeah.&quot;]<p>

[Jones - &quot;Fascinating. I hadn't run across that before.&quot;]<p>

[Journal Contributor Markus Mehring adds the following comments.  &quot;Regarding the camera motors, I'd say Charlie is wrong here. As far as I know, the magazines didn't have a separate motor or circuitry. The lower camera body contained two Ni-Cd-batteries (with a power reserve for about 2000 photos) and the motor; and this motor was fully responsible for cocking the shutter, triggering the exposure and for film transport. The Hasselblads were specifically designed that way very early in the program, and they didn't change much during Apollo. The magazines were, of course, non-standard, namely bigger than usual; but they contained little more than two open reels for 8-11 meters of film (that is, 140-180 frames, depending on film type and thus film thickness). I think this was a very sensible design (and in retrospect it worked like a charm), and adding a motor and a bunch of cables to the magazines would have meant less photos per magazine, extra load for the batteries and a potential source for technical flaws. Why make it complicated when the simpler design works.&quot;]<p>

[On the TV, we see Charlie turn his checklist pages until he gets to 
<a href="a16eva2LMP-15.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP-15</a> so he can see which of the planned Station 8 activities they completed.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:44:15</b> Duke: (At the LMP seat) Okay.  Station 8.  Pan.  Got the sampling.  Rake soil was done.  Okay;  only one boulder sample.  Sorry we couldn't turn one over, Tony.  Okay;  I was frame count 120, Tony.<p>

<b>147:44:35</b> England: Okay.  We copy that, Charlie.  And we may get a boulder yet, you never know.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Charlie checks the 16-mm camera.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:44:45</b> Duke: Okay; we've still got half mag of... (correcting himself) three quarters of a mag on the magazine RR (which he pronounces &quot;awra&quot;).  Do you want me to turn it on?<p>

<b>147:44:57</b> England: Yeah.  Let's go ahead and turn it on.<p>

<b>147:45:02</b> Duke: (Reaching up to turn the camera on)  Okay.  We'll let her run, one frame a second...<p>

<b>147:45:05</b> England: Okay.<p>

<b>147:45:06</b> Duke: ...f/8.<p>

<b>147:45:07</b> Young: Okay; Houston.  We're going Mode switch to 1.<p>

<b>147:45:12</b> England: Okay; see you later.

<blockquote><i>[Charlie gets ready to jump into his seat.]</i></blockquote>

<b>147:45:15</b> Young: Rog.  My frame count is 142. <p>

<b>147:45:17</b> England: Okay; 142.  [Static;  Long Pause]
