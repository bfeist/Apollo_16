      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Thisis Apollo Control. We've now had loss of signal with Apollo 16. We'llbe reacquiring the spacecraft in about 45 minutes. With a good maneuverwe would expect that acquisition time to be 79 hours, 10 minutes, 25seconds. Without the burn we would be reacquiring about three and ahalf minutes prior to that, or at 79 hours, 6 minutes, 46 seconds. AsApollo 16 went around the corner of the Moon everything looked good forthe maneuver. The spacecraft was in an orbit of 169.4 by 58.1 nauticalmiles [313.7 by 107.6 kilometres] and the last velocity reading we gotwas 5,368 feet [1,636 metres] per second. We're now about nine minutes,17 seconds away from the scheduled time that the crew will beperforming Descent Orbit Insertion. At 78 hours, 25 minutes this isApollo Control, Houston.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at79 hours, 6 minutes. We're about four and a half minutes away from theexpected time of reacquiring Apollo 16 on its third revolution of theMoon. At which time they should have lowered their orbit to about 10 by58 nautical miles [19 by 107 kilometres]. If, however, for some reasonthey did not perform that maneuver we would be reacquiring in about 30seconds. The Service Propulsion engine on this particular spacecraft isconsuming about 66 pounds of propellant per second of burn; based onthat when next we see Apollo 16 they should be about 1,600 pounds [726kilogrammes] lighter and traveling about 1,136 miles an hour slower[sic - correctly quoted as 136 miles(251 kilometres) per hourearlier]. The Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver which was targeted tooccur at the Ground Elapsed Time of 78 hours, 33 minutes, 44 secondswas to have been a 24.2 second burn of the Service Propulsion Systemengine, and this would produce a total velocity change of 210.3 feetper second [64.1 metres per second], most of which would be retrograde,giving us the desired orbit of 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by19.1 kilometres]. And we've passed the time of acquisition had they notperformed the burn.&nbsp; All continues to be quiet. We're now threeminutes away from the expected time of acquisition with a good DescentOrbit Insertion maneuver.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo control. We should be coming up on acquisition of signal now. And network reports that we have AOS.</p><a name="079_10_37"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 37 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. Nominal burn; first - first DOI burn we ever had that was nominal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 44 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That's great news.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 46 Young:</b> At least in our training.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 51 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we'll stand by for your burn report.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 10 56 Duke:</b> Okay, Henry. It feels like if wehad - we're clipping the tops of the trees all through there - what itlooks like. We got a burn report of a Delta-T<sub>ig</sub>, 0 [garble]. all we got was 24.4, plus two balls 06 - 2106 V<sub>GX</sub>. Trim attitude 001, 272, 003; so we did not trim. Residuals were plus 0.8, plus 0, plus 0.1; minus 2.3 Delta-V<sub>C</sub>; Fuel 337, Ox 346. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 42 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, 16. Unbalanced?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 48 Duke:</b> Okay, it jumped up to 200 increase.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 53 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 56 Duke:</b> It never really stabilized though, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 11 59 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 12 10 Young:</b> And a Verb 82, last look, thought we were at 10.9 [nautical miles - 20.1 kilometres] perigee.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 12 15 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy 10.9.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 12 24 Young:</b> But I don't think it really knows. But the MSFN really knows.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> That last comment wasfrom John Young. Earlier we heard from Charlie Duke reporting a nearlyperfect Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. Young reported that they'reon board. Readings show that they had an apolune of - rather a periluneof 10.9 nautical miles. The targeted was 10.3, but again that's anonboard reading and we'll be tracking and getting a reading here on theground.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 13 29 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. it appeared to us that we got an auto shutdown.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 13 34 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Charlie. Copy auto shutdown.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 15 10 Young:</b> You got any preliminary data, Houston?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 15 14 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, John. The doppler says stay; we're waiting on the short arc.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 15 20 Young:</b> Okay; thank you.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> John Young's question isin reference to Stay/No-Stay - that we'll be passing up from theControl Center here in the event that tracking data -- we've got abouttwo minutes of it on which the Flight Dynamics Officer will make hiscalculations - in the event tracking data showed that we did not getthe desired orbit and we're in an unsafe orbit, the crew has a maneuveron board that they would perform to raise their orbit to a satisfactorylevel. This is a so-called bailout burn which would be performed at 79hours, 22 minutes, 8 seconds or about six minutes from now. Allindications, preliminary, are that everything is good. Assuming thatmaneuver when as planned, and the orbit is as we would expect, Apollo16 should be at an altitude of about 19 nautical miles [35 kilometres]above the lunar surface, accounting for Charlie Duke's earlier commentthat it appeared to be right down among the tree tops.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 17 42 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. You're good on the short arc. You have a stay, and we show you 59 by 10.7.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 17 53 Young:</b> Roger; 59 by 10.7. Thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 19 13 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Can you - could you give us Auto on the High Gain?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 19 21 Young:</b> Roger. You have it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 04 Mattingly:</b> Henry, if you remember thatlittle real bright crater on the northern rim of Chaplygin that Stu andFarouk were talking about the other day, we - we happened to see itright up close to us as we came by on this orbit, and we got a coupleof pics for you on it, and that really is an unusual little guy. Andit's really beautiful.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 35 Mattingly:</b> Probably getting carriedaway with all of this, but we've - we've got all kinds of things to seeback there. It would really be nice to fly that kind of an orbit downlow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 44 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 20 49 Mattingly:</b> And, we're pitching down toour landmark track attitude, and this is my first chance to point thesextant at the surface, and the sextant is just as clear as a bell.It's beautiful. You can pick out little bitty features. They're just-they're just as clear. There's no fuzziness. And the telescope's thesame way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 21 08 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that's great: We ought to be able to get some good use out of that.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.The landmark tracking Ken Mattingly is referring to is a procedure usedon board the spacecraft to determine their orbit. It's also a procedurethat will be used by Mattingly from lunar orbit to track the spacecrafton the surface of the Moon, hopefully, and allow scientist on theground to compute a precise location for the landing site for thetouchdown part of the Lunar Module. We now show Apollo 16 at analtitude of 13.8 nautical miles [25.6 kilometres], continuing to dropdown towards Pericynthion. And the preliminary tracking data, theflight dynamics officer reported, shows an orbit of 59 by 10.7[nautical miles 109 by 19.8 kilometres]. We expect that that orbit willbe refined somewhat as we get additional tracking that's based on thefirst look of the tracking data, but is very close to the desired orbitof 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 kilometres].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 23 11 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Omni Delta.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 26 17 Duke:</b> Hank, out to the - my side, outWindow 5, there was one crater here that you could see in one sectionof it, it looked like some outcrop two-thirds the way up the craterwall, and some big blocks had rolled down the - into the crater floor,and you could see the boulder tracks all the way down.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 26 37 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy. Can you locate that one?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 26 42 Duke:</b> Wait a minute. No, I'm pretty lost right now. Let me see if I can figure it out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 27 11 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, while you'remaneuvering there, we'd like to ask what value did you put in your EMS,and what did you get on your EMS check?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 28 28 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. That crater I had, I think was in a series around Maclaurin, maybe a little bit further west than that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 28 41 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 29 40 Duke:</b> Hank, coming across the mare here, it reminds you of [garble] static system cals at Edwards.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 29 49 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. You're really down low, screaming across, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 30 24 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Did you copy the question I had about the EMS Delta-V?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 21 Duke:</b> Houston, the Goclenius Rillelooks like large grabens with very subdued sides to them; no outcrop atall apparent from my position.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 36 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 47 Duke:</b> And looking on up into the Gutenberg Rilles you can see it cross - one crater just climbs right across the crater wall.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 31 57 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 00 Duke:</b> And that's Gutenberg Sea. That's Gutenberg Sea, Hank, and you can see the wall is down,dropped into the rille.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 10 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy. How do you read, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 15 Duke:</b> I'm reading you five by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 19 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. A littler earlier, I asked a question about the EMS Delta-V. Did you copy that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 25 Duke:</b> Negative; we did not.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 27 Hartsfield:</b> Okay ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 28 Duke:</b> It - it read minus 2.3.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We had a question here as to how the EMS Delta-V check came out, and which value you loaded into the Delta-V counter?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 41 Duke:</b> Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 44 Mattingly:</b> Can I call you in a second on that, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 45 Hartsfield:</b> Sure thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 32 47 Mattingly:</b> It was like - it was like1.8 at shutdown because of the drift in the EMS, and I did a check, andit came out to be normal and the bias was the same. I put in the Delta-V<sub>T</sub>, the same thing that we've used before, but then it looked to me like the bias was in - less than half a foot per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 06 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy. We were alittle confused here because the - the value that you had at the endthere was somewhere in between what we thought it ought to be,depending on which setting you put in the Delta-V counter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 19 Mattingly:</b> Roger. It was about 1.6 or something like that at shutdown. I'll have to look back at the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 30 Duke:</b> Okay, Houston. The walls - thenorth wall of Capella has striations that are dipping eastward about 60degrees or so, all the way across the north face.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 46 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 51 Duke:</b> Okay, and also Isidorus, the same thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 33 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 34 14 Hartsfield:</b> J-2 should be on the horizon now, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 34 19 Mattingly:</b> Roger. We got the - it'sright on the horizon. Still haven't picked up the target yet. Lookslike it's tracking just about right. I have Theophilus going out of thefield of view now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 36 09 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, you're coming up on about 30 seconds to TCA.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 36 22 Duke:</b> He has the target, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 36 26 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 38 54 Mattingly:</b> Big old hill down the stream from - Where you are going [garble]?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 39 02 Young:</b> Guess who is sneaking in marks on Gator Crater right now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 39 07 Hartsfield:</b> I wonder who.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Gator crater is about 700yards across one of the craters at the Descartes landing site. KenMattingly obviously taking a landmark sightings on that crater at thepresent time, and as Apollo 16 passes directly over the landing site.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 40 26 Young:</b> Now that's what I call OJT right there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 40 33 Hartsfield:</b> How did the landing site look through the sextant?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 40 45 Young:</b> You have to do that with the telescope, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 40 48 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 41 11 Duke:</b> I think that was the best high-speed pass I've ever made.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 42 42 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. I have your Map[ping] and Pan Camera photo PADs for 80:35 whenever you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 43 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Henry; go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 43 09 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. T-start, 080:38:01; T-stop, 080:46:04. And that same PAD is good for the Pan Camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 43 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay. T-start, 080:38:01; T-stop, 080:46:04.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 43 40 Hartsfield:</b> Good readback.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>079 44 51 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Hank, you want me to go ahead and do this Single Jet Authority, or use couples to go to the attitude?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 44 59 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 45 10 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, why don't you go ahead and go coupled, then we can go Single Jet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 45 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Sounds like a good plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 47 11 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Omni Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 47 58 Mattingly:</b> Hark, would you check onone thing for me? Would you find out if this method I've been using forreading out the maneuver times, Verb 4 Noun 1, is in any way affectedby or affects the use of Program 509?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 14 Hartsfield:</b> Will do, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 18 Mattingly:</b> Thank you, sir. And I got acouple of minutes here, if you would like to go over some of thosequestions you had before now. I - I wasn't paying much attention.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 33 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken. I think they got your answer awhile ago and it satisfied them, but I'll make sure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I wasn't paying a lot of attention; I was trying to pick up that landmark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 46 Hartsfield:</b> Do you have any comments on the landmark tracking? Did it all go smoothly?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 48 52 Mattingly:</b> Well, except for the factthat those optics are perfect, that's really neat. The target area didnot look as I anticipated. It's a - I think it's a function of the lowSun angle, but it looked to me like there were far more rims around thecraters than - than what - the impression I had from looking at thingson the - on the models. And I did not pick up North or South Ray; theystill were in the shadows. So, I guess it's possible that I could havebeen on the wrong crater, but it sure looked like to me like I musthave been on Gator.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 49 30 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 49 32 Mattingly:</b> It's still - still aproblem in scaling when you look at something like that, until you'resure that you have the right feel for it. But I think it's prettyobvious, and I think picking it up tomorrow will be relatively easy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 50 45 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Could you bring up the High Gain, Pitch plus 35, Yaw 290.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 02 Mattingly:</b> Say again your Yaw number.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 03 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; 290.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 36 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, there's no problem in ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, and we're about - Go ahead, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 44 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. They say there is no problem in calculating maneuver completion time, and - and it does not interfere with 509.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 51 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay, thank you. I've beenavoiding using that. All right. We're about ready to go through oursolar monitor and tiedown release. You folks ready for us to do that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 52 12 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We're ready to go, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 52 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 54 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Houston. We released the tiedowns and the door and heard just a very tiny little sound on each of those activities.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 54 33 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 11 Mattingly:</b> Hank, another piece ofquestionable data that've collected today is - well, on our low pass onthe back side there, we got our color wheel out. And we have two votesfor Number 17, and one vote for Number 13.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 28 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 30 Mattingly:</b> And that's over on the backside just past Chaplygin. And Number 17 really isn't quite right; it'sjust the closest thing we have. And the same comment applies to Number13.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>079 55 41 Young:</b> Well, I still say 13 was right on.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at80 hours, 12 minutes. The Guidance and Control Officer reports thatfrom looking at the replay of data from that Descent Orbit Insertionmaneuver performed at the end of the second revolution, he reports thatthe engine appeared to perform normally in every respect and we'recurrently showing Apollo 16 in an orbit 58.6 nautical miles by 9.9[108.5 by 18.3 kilometres] and we expect that will continue to berefined somewhat. Ken Mattingly has completed a series of exercisesthat deploy certain of the experiments in the Service Module ScientificInstrument Module Bay, the SIM Bay experiments, the Gamma Ray and GammaRay Spectrometer and Mass Spectrometer on 25 foot [7.6 metre] and 24foot [7.3 metre] booms respectively were extended to their full outpositions and then retracted, to checked the operation. Mattingly thenextended the Mass Spectrometer to about a third of it's length andturned it on. It's about 8.4 feet [2.6 metres] out from the side of theService Module now on it's retractable boom. And also turned on theLaser Altimeter. The Mass Spectrometer is designed to gatherinformation on the nature and composition of the lunar atmosphere; alsoto detect contaminants in that atmosphere. Such things as the volatileproducts...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>080 14 12 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. We're about two minutes from LOS.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>080 14 21 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Over.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> The Mass Spectrometerdetects such things as tile volatile products given off by volcanoes,should any of those happen to be active around this time, we alsodetect water vapor should that exist in the lunar atmosphere. The otherexperiment activated by Mattingly was the Laser Altimeter. You heardhim ask how that was performing. A report from the Orbital ScienceOfficer here was that it appeared to be functioning normally. Thisdevice measures the spacecraft altitude above the lunar surface and iscorrelated with Panoramic Camera photographs obtained of the lunarsurface. Putting these two bits of information together - the photo andthe laser altimeter data - it's possible to determine within about 6feet [1.8 metres] the elevation of lunar surface features. We are nowabout 45 seconds from loosing radio contact with Apollo 16 as thespacecraft passes behind the Moon on its third revolution. We'll bereacquiring - reestablishing radio contact at the beginning of thefourth revolution in about 45 minutes.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 31 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Our data down here we worked on during the back side shows you're in 58.8 by 10.6.</p><a name="081_07_46"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 46 Young:</b> Okay. And while - while we were on the back side, we had a couple of Main B Undervolt lights.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 07 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. You want to tell us about it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 08 03 Young:</b> Stand by. Yeah, it was when Ken was - messing around with the SIM bay, and he'll fill you in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 08 11 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 08 14 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, we got a littlebehind on this sequence already, Hank. But as soon as I turned the -had the Mapping on and it worked fine, I turned the Pan Camera on, andas soon as I went to Operate on the Pan Camera, we got a Main BUndervolt. So I turned it back to Standby and left it there. Charliesaid he saw about 25 volts on Main B, and concluded I'd wait and letyou take a look at it. And then we got another Main B Undervolt at somefive minutes or so later, and it again was momentary. By the time welooked at it, it all looked pretty normal. The only - We checked thefuel cell regulator pressures. They looked good, and I really don'thave any idea what might of caused it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 09 02 Hartsfield:</b> Yeah. All the things we could check look okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 09 06 Duke:</b> Hank, we got a - it might not even be a small anomaly, but Fuel Cell 3, the H<sub>2</sub> flow's running a little bit higher than the O<sub>2</sub> flow, but the regulator pressure looks fine to me. But the other two fuel cells, H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, match.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 09 24 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 13 Young:</b> My guess is when you dump the DSE the whole story will be right on there probably.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 17 Hartsfield:</b> Okay [garble]. John.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 23 Young:</b> When you get the DSE translated, probably tell you what happened.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 10 25 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 07 Mattingly:</b> Hank, you really can see both the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray booms deployed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Understand you can see them both.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 14 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. Looks like a couple of feet of the boom is about all you can see.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 28 Hartsfield:</b> You've really got us puzzled with this undervolt now, because the Pan Camera runs off from Main A.,</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 44 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, we'd noticed the samething. It - you know it may not be rational, but it just seemed likethat was the - I touched one switch and got a Main Undervolt so I tookit back off again. Decided to even let you think about it before I[garble] anymore.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 52 Duke:</b> Possible that it doesn't have any connection.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 11 53 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 09 Mattingly:</b> I still have the power on it, Hank. I've got it in Standby and Power on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 15 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. And, Ken, I'd like to verify - is your- Nonessential Bus on Main A or Main B?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 28 Mattingly:</b> That's Main A.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 12 30 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 03 Duke:</b> And, Hank, last night we - I -think we got verification that we could wear the LCGs to bed tonightand be all ready to go by in the morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 14 Hartsfield:</b> That is affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 20 Duke:</b> Okay. Anybody thought any more about my suit?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 26 Hartsfield:</b> We thought about it, andsmoked it over, and we kind of think maybe we ought to do nothingunless you have some real bad trouble tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 13 39 Duke:</b> Like if we can't get it zipped.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 14 07 Young:</b> Okay. Can we use my pliers on it to pull the zipper closed?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 14 53 Young:</b> Houston. Houston, 16. Do you read? Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 14 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Reading you 5 by 5, John. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 15 03 Young:</b> Okay. If I have trouble closingit, can I use my pliers to get a better grip on it to pull it closed?Because it took me the better part of 20 minutes the other day to doit, and it usually takes about two. There's a place on there in thesmall of Charlie's back where that thing has just separated too farapart on the restraint zipper for me to pull it closed easily. When hegets on the LCG, the FCS, and the UCD bulk in there, the suit is goingto be farther apart than it was - yesterday.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 16 03 Hartsfield:</b> John, we talked to Daveabout that, and he said the big problem is that you can't arch yourback in zero g as well. He had - he had a lot of trouble too, but onthe Moon in one-sixth g he had no problem at all, because the gravityhelped him arch his back. Does that sound like the problem - you justcouldn't get arched back that far enough to do it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 16 30 Young:</b> Got me there. It looked like he was arched as much as he usually is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 16 46 Young:</b> But you're saying that if I can't do it in - in zero g, we go on down to the Moon and try it in one-sixth g?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 17 00 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That sounds prettygood, John. We - we did look at a backup procedure here, but it's along - looks like a long thing and involves using a needle and pullingthings together like you're sewing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 17 43 Duke:</b> Okay, Hank. I think to give usevery benefit of the doubt that I will not - I don't plan to wear the -the FCS probably tomorrow, and I'll just use the LCG and UCD.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 18 07 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Understand, and could you give us Auto on - the high gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 18 16 Duke:</b> There you go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 19 28 Duke:</b> Hank, also we would like to getpermission to fill the drink bags tonight to save a few minutes also,if you think that's gonna be all right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 19 43 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That - Go ahead and do that, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 19 48 Duke:</b> All right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 20 31 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, we can't find anyconnection between the Pan Camera and Main Bus A, and we were wondering- Main Bus B, and we were wondering if, when you got the secondmomentary one - undervolt - were you moving any switches at that time?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 20 49 Mattingly:</b> That's negative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 13 Mattingly:</b> They were both momentary Main Bus undervolts.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 24 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. The - the first one was momentary also?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 31 Mattingly:</b> It - it could be, or itcould be that the sensor is triggering at the wrong level. It could bethat the sensor shifted up to something that looks reasonable. Iwouldn't object - we still got the Pan Camera power on - I wouldn'tobject to [garble] it to operate for a second and back off - go aheadand use a couple of frames just to let you watch it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 21 54 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 29 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 30 Hartsfield:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 34 Duke:</b> Is Tom satisfied with his Glycol Evap Out? We've got off scale, high here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 23 59 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by. Stand by a minute, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 24 21 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. You're [garble] is at the top of the scale. You're still okay. You should now monitor Rad Out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 24 32 Duke:</b> A Rad Out is 75.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 24 36 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p><a name="081_28_17"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 28 17 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Talked with the suit people, and they don't want you using the pliers on the zippers.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 28 31 Young:</b> I just used it to get a better grip with, not to pull the zipper, just to pull with.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 28 54 Hartsfield:</b> Their concern is over side load, John. They're afraid for you to use the pliers.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 06 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 34 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, Houston. We would like to talk to you a minute about this docking latch, if you're free.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 45 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p><a name="081_29_48"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 29 48 Hartsfield:</b>Okay. We've got a real long procedure here. I don't think you need tocopy it all down. Let me just read it through to you once, and kind oflet me discuss it as we go. What we want to do is kind of get a look atthe thing tomorrow and see what the condition of it is. After youdisconnect the LM umbilical, we want - would like for you to open theorange LM umbilical connector cover and inspect the roller pawl. Theroller pawl, we hope, is engaged in the detent, but we would like tofind out if it's in the detent, or is it free, or sticking up, and youcan do that by looking in the side of the latch after you remove thatumbilical connector cover. Is there any question on that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 38 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. I'm not sure I know what you're looking for.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 42 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, when you look in the side there ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 45 Mattingly:</b> ...I'm not at all sure what the roller pawl is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 30 46 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, the roller pawl ison the far left side of the latch, behind and above the AuxiliaryRelease Button. And it can be identified by the roller on the tip ofthe pawl. The pawl is just a little arm that sticks out, and it's got alittle roller on the end of it that rides on the cam that has thesedetents in it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 08 Mattingly:</b> Do you want to do this before we unlock it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 12 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And itbest be done tomorrow - before you get your helmet and gloves on, ofcourse. Just take a look at it while - perhaps while they're bringingthe LM up. And if you find after we get the condition of that, if theroller is down in the detent like we suspect that it is, when youremove the yellow probe umbilical cover on the right side of the latch,we would like you to look in the right side in there and at the bungeebell crank mechanism, and see if there's any foreign-object damage oranything wedged up in there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 51 Mattingly:</b> When you say remove thecover - do you mean physically remove it from the spacecraft, or justopen it up and look underneath it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 31 57 Hartsfield:</b> Just open it up and lookunder there, Ken. And this is mainly - these two steps is just aninspection. We'd just like to verify the condition of the roller pawland also the bell crank mechanism on the other side. Has nothing to dowith the latch, but at least it'll give us an idea of what's wronginside, if there is anything. It's not gonna help you in any way toprepare for unlocking it. To unlock it - after you've looked at thesetwo things, we would like to know if the latch handle requires force tocock the latch on the first stroke - and the second stroke, ifrequired. In other words, if the handle comes away real easy, as yourecall, then the thing is already cocked. More than likely, it is gonnatake some force, and we would like to verify how this works. And if itshould require force, pull it down, and then we want to see that thehook comes out there inboard approximately 16 degrees. If the hookdoesn't come out, then all you got to do is pull down on the handle tothe full cock position, and hold it, and then just reach up and grabthe hook, and pull it inboard about 16 degrees, and the hook shouldstay there. And then you just proceed with normal undocking.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 33 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay. So the kind of thing you want me to look for are information only. Is that affirmative?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 33 27 Hartsfield:</b> Right. It would help theguys down here to try to understand what - what really happened to thelatch. We kind of suspect it only got one cock. But if you look inthere, and look for the roller pawl on the left side and look at thebell crank on the right side, at least that would tell us that nothingis jamming it, and that the roller pawl is in the right direction -right place. Operationally though, prepare for undocking. What itreally amounts to, you just use the normal procedure. You pull thelatch handle down and cock it if necessary, and if the hook doesn'tcome back, just hold the latch handle all the way down to the full cockposition and pull the hook back.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>081 54 35 Mattingly:</b> Okay, would you settle for minus eight, so I can just leave it where it is?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 54 39 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; that's good enough. Just do it there and delete it from the back - back side of the card.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>081 55 44 Hartsfield:</b> Are you talking about the Oxidizer pressure, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>081 55 50 Mattingly:</b> No, sir; the manual Temp In and the glycol loop.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Thisis Apollo Control. We've lost radio contact now with the spacecraft asit passes behind the Moon on the fourth revolution. The crew isscheduled to begin a nine hour rest period while on the backside of theMoon, and we would expect to hear no further word from them until theend of that rest period. During this frontside pass on the fourthrevolution, there were three major items covered. I'll try to runthrough those three, and summarize what to us appeared to be the majorpoints. On first reacquiring contact, John Young reported that they hadseen two Main Bus B undervolt conditions - as he described it thesewere transitory events Main Bus B voltage dropping briefly to the pointto where it triggered a Master Caution and Warning alarm. Normally,Main Bus B, which is one of two Main Buses supplying electrical powerto the equipment aboard the Command and Service Module, operates atabout 27 to 28 volts under load. The Master Caution and Warning is setto trigger at 26.25 volts, if the voltage drops to that level. And inreplaying the data tapes, we saw the voltage drop to about 26.14 volts.The data tape replay, however, showed no indication of a problem withany of the electrical equipment. One sometimes suspects momentarycurrent overloads -- a heavy drain of current which would then drag thevoltage down, but there was no indication that any of the equipment wasmalfunctioning. The one thing the crew described that appeared to becoincident with the.voltage drop, was the operation of the Pan Camera.However, simultaneous data on this camera, when it was operating,showed that the camera was functioning normally. At this point afterlooking at all of the data, and considering the loads on both Main BusA and Main Bus B, one supposition is that we had a coincident series ofevents, which momentarily overloaded Main Bus B. Such things as heaterscoming on simultaneously at the same time we had a heavy current drainfor the SIM bay activities. If this is, in fact, the case, it caneasily be remedied by transferring some of the load to Main Bus A - asimple re-configuration. And that appears to be the most likely causeof the Main Bus undervoltages, in which case we would have noparticular problem. One other thing that was discussed, was the suitproblem. Going back to the beginning of this one - Charlie Dukereported last night on entering the Lunar Module suited - gettingsuited up and getting into the Lunar Module that John Young [sic - itwas actually Charlie Duke himself that had experienced the problems]had some difficulty getting the suit zipped. The restraint zipperclosed across the back of the suit - this zipper does not maintain thepressure of the suit, but is a load carrying zipper that holds all thelayers together on the outside of the pressure layers. And Dukementioned in order to minimize the problem of getting the suit zippedtomorrow, he would like to leave off the Fecal Containment System. Inzipping the suit up the first time both the Fecal Containment Systemand the Liquid Cool[ed] Garment were not worn. Duke's feeling was thatonce these additional items were added underneath the suit it wouldincrease the problem of closing that zipper. And we gave him a go aheadto leave the fecal containment system off, and recommend that he makean attempt to get the suit zipped using the normal procedures. JohnYoung suggested the possibility of using a pair of pliers that theycarry on board to assist in it, a recommendation at this time is thatnot be done. Dave Scott, who was by earlier in the evening, discussedwith the flight controllers a similar problem that they encountered,although apparently not quite so severe, on Apollo 15. And Dave'sanalysis of that situation was that in zero G it's more difficult toarch one's back without gravity to help. Arching the back is a methodthat is used to reduce the strain across the zipper so that it iseasier to get it closed, and it was suggested to Charlie that he makeevery effort to brace himself and get the back arched in order to makethe job a little easier of getting the zipper closed. And we do have abackup procedure that'll be discussed with the crew to assist inclosing that zipper. If the problem arises tomorrow when they'repreparing to get into the Lunar Module and suiting up. Also CapComHenry Hartsfield discussed a procedure with Ken Mattingly for checkingout the docking latches. One of the 12 docking latches has apparentlynot latched down firmly onto the LM tunnel docking ring. This causes noparticular concern, but there is some interest in determining why thelatch did not close. Mattingly, last night, was asked to cycle a devicethat is connected with the latch. This gave the flight controllers anindication that the latch, which is cocked prior to docking, was notfully cocked, and therefore, did not latch fully. There is also thepossibility that the latch is broken. In order to determine which ofthese is the case, Mattingly was given a series of procedures tofollow, of which we hope will provide some information and shed somelight on whether the latch simply was not fully cocked, or whether itis broken or has malfunctioned in some other way. This is primarily ofconcern for future flights. It doesn't have a direct bearing on thisflight, it's felt that the latch will in no way effect undocking andsince only three of the 12 latches are required for a firm harddocking, there is no particular concern that it will in any way effectthe docking either. As mentioned previously, we expect to see the crewasleep when next we reacquire the spacecraft. That will be about 40minutes. And as Apollo 16 went around the corner on the fourthrevolution, we showed it in an orbit of 58.7 by 10.4 nautical miles[108.7 by 19.3 kilometres]. At 82 hours, 19 minutes into the flight ofApollo 16, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
