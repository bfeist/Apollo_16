      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 39 minutes. [sic - the actual GET is 141:27, but the PAO is about to explain the reason for the difference.] We just a minute ago reacquired [the] spacecraft, Casper. Ken Mattingly is in the midst of his sleep period at the present time. He has about one hour, 20 minutes in that sleep period [ sic - see next PAO statement at 141:34]. And is essentially back on the flight plan. Yesterday at 118 hours, 30 minutes we updated the clocks here in Mission Control and at the same time synchronized the clock aboard the Command Module to the updated time. That time update was 11 minutes, 48 seconds. At 118 hours, 30 minutes the clocks here in Mission Control and the clock aboard the Command Module were moved ahead to 118 hours, 41 minutes, 48 seconds. The clock aboard the Lunar Module Orion is not yet been updated with the new time and won't be until sometime prior to LM liftoff and the rendezvous sequence. [The] primary reason for this is that the crew on the Lunar surface is little concerned with Ground Elapsed times. They will be of course concerned with the Ground Elapsed Times when it becomes time to get back into synchronization with the Command Module and to get into orbit around the Moon. But while on the lunar surface they're primarily concerned with segment times - with the elapsed times. [That is, with] the amount of time - until an EVA the amount of time lapsed during an EVA and that sort of thing. And it has not been necessary at this point to update the clock in the Lunar Module, although for the flight planning purposes we are using the updated Ground Elapsed Time. The principle reason for the time update for setting the clocks ahead in Mission Control and on the Command Module was as a result of the orbital changes resulting from the late lunar landing and the late circularization maneuver, which was performed by the Command Module. This changed the orbit about the Moon and got the orbit out of sequence with the flight plan so that Ken Mattingly was finding that his acquisition of signal times, his loss of signal times and the events in between primarily (garble) of opportunity and so on were not coming up at the same time that they were listed in the flight plan. The alternatives at this point are to do one of two things. Either to change all of the numbers in the flight plan all the way through or simply to change the clock and leave the flight plan as it is. And it has been a procedure for the last couple of missions to make the change simply by changing the clocks. This is the simpler thing to do. We just simply move the clock ahead to the point that it then agreed with the acquisition and lose of signal times in the flight plan. And as I said previously at the appropriate time, the Lunar Module clocks will also be sync to this new time. We now show one hour 20 minutes until cabin depressurization, just prior to the start of the EVA. Based on yesterday's experience we'd expect that the EVA - the crew would begin getting out of the Lunar Module and down to the lunar surface roughly 10 minutes after we start the cabin depressurization. A short while ago Flight Director, Gene Krantz, who is still on the console, checked with the LM's systems engineer for a status report on the Lunar Module Orion and the report was that the LM looks very good this morning. The manned space flight network station, which will be covering most of the extravehicular activity, will be the station at Madrid, Spain. The station uses an 85 foot [26 metre] diameter dish antenna. At about 148 hours into the mission, which will be a good way through the EVA, we will begin to get coverage from the 210 foot [64 metre] dish antenna at Goldstone, California.</p>
      <p class="ed">[Despite the change to an adjusted GET, the Flight Journal will continue to record times in real GET - that is, in time elapsed since launch. Where necessary to follow timings in the Journal, both the adjusted GET used by Mission Control and the real GET will be shown.]</p> <a name="141_26_11"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 26 11 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning, Casper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 31 42 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning, Casper. You stirring around yet?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 32 41 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 32 48 Mattingly:</b> Hello, there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 32 49 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning. Did you have a good night?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 32 57 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 141 hours, 46 minutes [adjusted GET, 141:34 real GET]. We'd like to correct one portion of a previous statement, that is in regard to the flight plan for Casper. Mattingly is, indeed, back on the original flight plan. However that plan calls for him to be awake at this time and we have just put in a call to the Command Module. Capsule Communicator Hank Hartsfield called Mattingly to see that he was awake. Mattingly came back with a cheery good morning and he'll be going through his wakeup routine - primarily getting something to eat and then getting ready for a busy days activities in lunar orbit. The Flight Director for the Command Module, Casper is again Don Puddy. Casper [is] now in its 35th revolution of the moon, having just come around the front side and moving toward the Descartes site.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 35 38 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. We show you in CMC, Free.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 35 48 Mattingly:</b> Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 37 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay, the Gamma Ray Shield is Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 37 19 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 37 26 Mattingly:</b> And the Pan Camera Power is coming on -</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>141 37 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 37 45 Mattingly:</b> Are you ready for a status report?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 37 52 Hartsfield:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 37 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Bravo 1, 15051; Bravo 3, 6&frac12;; Bravo 4, negative. On the chow. On Meal A, had scrambled eggs, orange juice with potassium. On Meal B, had coffee, orange drink with potassium, and a beef steak. Meal C, delete the frankfurters. Add turkey and gravy and coffee.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 38 49 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we got it. And, Ken, your consumables - we're just about back on the nominal for the cryo, and the RCS is 150 pounds above the redline.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 39 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's sort of holding its own, then, isn't it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 39 17 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And if you'll give us Accept, we'll get your state vector up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 39 24 Mattingly:</b> You've got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 41 56 Hartsfield:</b> And Casper, we're clear for a Power, Off, on the Pan Camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 42 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Power is coming Off -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 42 09 Mattingly:</b> Mark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 42 54 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, I've got some words on the SIM bay status, if you want to listen.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 43 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Fire away.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 43 04 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, mapping camera is working real well, except for that extension problem. We have a margin of 203 frames. The laser altimeter is still degrading. We're down to where we're getting about 70 percent of the good altitudes. Thirty percent of the time, it's fouling up. The pan camera is overexposing the film, but we can process a great deal of that out. However, we will lose some resolution. We're 58 frames ahead on that. The mass spec is perking along real good, and no immediate evidence of purges or water drops in the data. And we got that retraction problem that you're aware of, where we will leave it out except for burns. And the gamma ray spectrometer is doing excellent work. We've got good peaks for thorium, silicon, and potassium. And the X-ray and alpha particle are nominal. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 44 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 44 15 Hartsfield:</b> And the computer is yours.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 06 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, the first one is at 142 hours.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 13 Mattingly:</b> All right; go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 14 Hartsfield:</b> Delete the "Charge Battery A."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's deleted.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 21 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, at 143:15.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 30 Mattingly:</b> Go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 32 Hartsfield:</b> Delete the Verb 48 load.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Verb 48 is deleted at 143:15.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 45 45 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At the same time, 143:15, we want to add, "P20, option 5; minus-X forward trim attitude; maneuver completion time of 143:32. Your Noun 79 is 3 degrees. Set high gain."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 46 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay, at 143:15, it'll be option 5, minus-X SIM bay; Noun 79, 3 degrees; 143:32 is the maneuver completion time; and I would guess the High Gain ought to be about 01, 170.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 46 38 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And immediately following that, we want to go to the CSM Experiment/EVA Checklist, Gum Nebula photo sequence B, page X/2-8. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 47 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And then we do - get ready for the Gum Nebula sequence B on page X/2-8.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 47 10 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. This will give you some warning here because, after you eat there, there's probably not enough time to get that before you have to start it. Okay, at 143:35...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 47 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay, yep.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>141 47 26 Hartsfield:</b> ...acquire MSFN with the - the Manual, Wide, zero and 170. Just change it to the angles you've got. Normal acquisition, S-Band, greater than 1/2 scale, you know, then Reacq now.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. Through the rather noisy communications, that sounded like John Young, reporting that he and Charlie Duke are now getting into their portable life support systems, and based on our experience yesterday, we found that the communications improved noticeably when they got on the communication unit in the portable life support system, and a mode in which their communication is relayed through the Lunar Module. As mentioned previously we are receiving the spacecraft on Earth through the 85 foot dish antenna at Madrid, Spain. And a good way through the EVA, at 148 hours approximately, we'll begin getting coverage from the 210 foot dish at Goldstone, California. Our best estimate at the present time is that the crew will be ready to get out of the Lunar Module at 143 hours, 15 minutes [143:03], or about one hour, 15 minutes from now. The Command Module, Casper, is presently in an orbit 55.5 by 64 nautical miles. Ken Mattingly is up and about, getting ready for an active day of orbital experiments and photography.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 142 hours 22 minutes [142:10] and we're experiencing the same sort of noisy communications we did yesterday at the beginning of the first EVA or during the EVA preparation. While the crew is still using the LM as the relay from the Portable Life Support System. Once we go on the lunar communications relay unit using the high gain and the low gain antennas instead of the LM omni-directional antenna we should see the same sort of a marked improvement in the communications that we did on the first EVA. There will be an informal briefing in about 15 minutes in the MSC news center briefing room on orbital science. That again is a briefing in about 15 minutes in the MSC news center briefing room and the subject will be the orbital science being performed by the Command and Service Module, Ken Mattingly aboard Casper. We have an updated time of egress, time that the crew will be getting out of the Lunar Module, Orion, on the lunar surface. It looks as if from the progress they are making in the checklist at the present time that they will be getting out about 15 minutes earlier than we had previously estimated. That new egress time again an estimate is about 143 hours or about 37 minutes from now.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>143 26 21 Mattingly:</b> The only - Okay. Let me give you that. I just was turning the page. I did have one comment; the first - the first frame on that antisolar sequence, I think is probably not part of the Gegenschein experiment itself. I think that's more of this zodiacal light business. But it's a five-minute exposure, and we took it with the spacecraft - Let's say my head's down and nearly in the local horizontal. The camera was pointing 30 degrees down, and it looks to me like it would have had the Moon in - in earthshine - in the field of view; so I suspect that that's not much of a - not a very good frame. The rest of the sequences went - went fine, and the pointing attitudes pointed us right at the places on the chart. And I have attitude errors on the antisolar sequence. I'll just give you the attitudes at the end, and restart it from the proper attitudes. It was 165, 257, and 354. The second part of step 4 was 167, 258, 357. The attitudes in step 7: 169, 264, and 0. Attitudes in step 10: 164, 275, and 359. Magazine Zulu Zulu has 15 exposures taken. </p>

      <p class="tech"><b>143 29 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let me get a couple of bags ahead here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 29 36 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Hank, a little curiosity here that I guess it's just "gee-whiz." I've been noticing some things like I got Tool E tied to the G&amp;N handrail, and I got a pair of scissors strapped down here in the LEB, on a tether, and I got a trash bag up in the tunnel; and most things in the cockpit give you troubles with floating around. They really - you really got to pay attention if you want them to be stable. But the trash bag never leaves the tunnel. And Tool E, every time I've looked at it has been pointing - it's been hanging up instead of hanging down as you would think of it in the CMS. And my scissors are generally up. And I - I had decided that gee, that, you know, that's my imagination. That can't really be. There's no preferred direction. Then I got to thinking about the thruster configuration we have giving us the - all minus-X thrusting whenever they do fire for attitude control, and so I thought I'd take a look here while we're in Attitude Hold; and sure enough, in Attitude Hold, the tool E didn't go up and the scissors do stay down. And I guess that's when we were Free most of that time rather than Attitude Hold. Apparently, you can see the effects over a long period in the cockpit of the minus-X firings for attitude. I thought that was kind of unusual. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 32 14 Hartsfield:</b> That's pretty interesting.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 32 22 Mattingly:</b> And let me get - get a bag open here and I'll be ready to copy while I'm drinking. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 32 29 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>143 33 40 Mattingly:</b> Hank, if we're going to do this during the - in an actual eat period, the best thing for us to do is probably for you to read them very slowly, and I'll copy all I can and then when we get to the end, I'll read them back to you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 33 53 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 145:14, this is a minor change in that Mapping Camera photo pad. The longitude there, where it says "159.9 degrees to 20.7 degrees west," that should be "23.7 degrees west," and it's just for your own information; and that's two and a half revs.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 34 25 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The next change is at 146:18, on the next page. 146:17, really, where it starts there with "Gamma Ray Shield - Off."

At 146:24 there where - in the block for MSFN updates, we won't be giving you a Mapping Camera photo pad; instead it'll be a Pan Camera photo pad; this is just for your information, and it'll be copied at 148:10.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 35 25 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, we need High Gain, Auto, and we'd like to verify the position of the DSE recorder switch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 35 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You've got Auto, and the DSE is in Forward and Forward; High Bit Rate.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>143 36 21 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, the next change is at 146:27; we want to delete all the little business there with the "Gamma Ray Gainstep - On (up) 4 steps (step 7)/ Shield - On (center)." Delete that whole line. Okay. The next change is at 146:30. At the top of the page. This is a minor change. The SIM experiment status should now be "Plus 1111 and 02222."

Okay, on the next page, at 148 hours, right at the top of the page, we want to add "Gamma Ray, Retract, to 7&frac12; feet." The time for the retraction is 2 minutes 26 seconds. At 148:05, add "Pan Camera, Standby; Stereo; Power - verify; Pan Camera, Operate at T-start." And, Ken, somewhere out beside that, you can build you a little block, if you like, to copy the Pan Camera photo pad. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 40 27 Hartsfield:</b> At 148:17, add "Pan Camera, Standby at T-stop; Pan Camera, Off, MSFN cue; and Gamma Ray, Deploy." </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 41 22 Hartsfield:</b> At 148:29, where it talks about "Gamma Ray: Gainstep" et cetera, delete the middle part of that so that it reads "Gamma Ray: Gainstep - On (center)." That should be "Shield - On." To repeat, that should read "Gamma Ray: Gainstep - Shield - On (center)." And right under that, at 148:30 there, delete "Mass Spec, Retract to 8.4 feet."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 42 44 Hartsfield:</b> At 148:30, at the top of the next column, the SIM status should be "Plus 1111, 02222." At the top of the next page, 149 hours, SIM status code should be the same as before, "Plus 1111, 02222." </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 43 52 Hartsfield:</b> And at 149:18, the block there that refers to "Pan Camera: Standby, Stereo, Power, Operate (T-start)," that little group, - this is a note to yourself - should be moved up such that the T-start occurs at 149:16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 44 37 Hartsfield:</b> At 149:30, the SIM status code should be "Plus 1211, 22222." And, Ken, that's all of them for now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>143 45 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, let me read them back to you, and I'll just start - start back here at the last one you gave me. At 149:30, we got the status code as 1211 and 22222. We moved the pan camera block that's now at 149:18 up to a point where the Operate comes at 149:16. SIM code on that page is - is four sticks [four "ones"], and zero, four deuces [four "2"s] . Same status code on the top at 148:30. 148:29, it's "Gamma Ray: Gainstep, On - or Shield, On." 148:20, it's "Gamma Ray, Deploy." And, at about 148:17, it's "Pan Camera, Standby at T-stop, and then Off at MSFN command." 148:15, it's "Pan Camera: Standby, Stereo, Power, and then Operate at T-start," and I got a block ready for T-start and stop. At 148 even, it's "Gamma Ray, retract to 7&frac12; feet," that's two minutes and 26 seconds from full retract - from full extension, and - I've deleted the Mapping Camera pad at 147:15. I've deleted the block Mapping Camera at 147:12 - Oops, except for the "Image Motion, Increase," which still goes in there. I got a status change at the top of 147; the bottom line is now 02222. 146:27, we delete the "Gamma Ray" line. Big change in position of the Pan Camera photo pad to 148:10. Deleted the little block of items starting with "Gamma Ray: Shield, Off," and ending with "Image Motion, Off" at 146:16. And the Mapping Camera photo pad down 145:12 is two and a half revs and ends at 23.7 west. </p>

Just as you said that I - I had just gotten in a position as I passed overhead the - the area, and I was taking a look - I had two things in mind. One of them was to - to [garble] by the landing area, and I got there too late to tell whether or not I had seen any of that. And then the - the next thing I did was to look over towards the terraces and see how they look today, and - when I looked over towards the terraces, it was kind of strange because I was looking out - And I'd say maybe you can see - at this Sun angle looks like there might be a terrace out there. And you can see Crest [?] crater very plainly. And the - the Cincos, you have to be - I have to be on top of the landing site to see it, and by the time I got around to that, I was downstream a ways; but I got a flash of light right at the base of Stone Mountain; just a glint, like a piece of metal flashed in the sunlight. And I'll bet you anything I got a reflection off the Rover if - if at about that time they were right at the base of Stone.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>144 08 00 Hartsfield:</b> Well, that's interesting, but disappointing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>144 08 07 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I was, too. And, actually, that's about the same score for the one that's out here by Lassell.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>144 08 34 Hartsfield:</b> Well, in the photograph for that one there northwest of North Ray, it sure does look like it had a lot darker material around it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>144 08 45 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I know it does, and I haven't had a chance to look at it straight down, but it - from an oblique, it sure - sure looks the same as all the rest of the things around there.</p>

He's - at the time that we thought you'd be busy taking all these pictures here, I told him to go ahead and configure it at this end so you wouldn't have to mess with it. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>144 27 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll just verify it, then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>144 27 08 Hartsfield:</b> And on another check there, INCO verified there was no problem with your configuration.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>144 27 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I may be mistaken, Hank, but I believe that I can see the outer two rings of Orientale, now. I'm just coming up on the earthshine terminator, and I can see a big circular basin, that's really a - really a big guy - fills the whole window. And I can see reflections off the far rim and off the near rim, and I've got two concentric rings with some flat areas and little - little build-ups in it, and it really looks hilly in there.

      <p class="obcm"><b>145 18 12 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> The old Sun angle comes down, you start to see more and more features around King's rim. This real white stuff looks like it's all streaked flow. It's hard to tell. Right now it looks to me like maybe some of these pools of things - they've got dark blocks in it and a lot more ripples. And it almost looks like that white cliff to the north had material flowing into the pool, rather than vice versa. And yet the stuff in the pool looks like it's flowing down and lapping into the crater itself. That pool of material runs out to the north. And this time, we'll try to follow some of these things out. The terrain out here doesn't look significantly different. It all has a somewhat radial pattern leaving King. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>145 19 28 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> You sure can't see any here yet, the very subtle expression that runs up. These slumps that I talked about yesterday that are out here in the crater just to the northwest look like they emanate away from King, like they maybe rushed up the side of this - of this cliff in this old crater. I'm not sure if that's the true interpretation, but that's the way they appear. The one that I find that's so dramatic and startling - is this blob on the side. I'm gonna take a frame of Papa Papa of that anyhow. Now where did it go? Come here, you. That is really an impressive thing. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>145 20 31 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> There's some blocks of material on the wall and some blocks in the center.</p>

It's got a very dark band of material that hangs down from it. It's got another lighter blob running down that looks dark, but it's not as dark. Around the very upper crest, you see the same evidence of dark material that you see around the sharp crests of most of these big craters.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>145 50 31 Mattingly:</b> You know, Hank, you wouldn't think you could lose something in only 12 feet. Right now, I've probably got more things lost than I've got found. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 50 43 Hartsfield:</b> (Laughter) Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 50 56 Mattingly:</b> Somewhere, I lost the ring sight that goes on the TV camera and the Hasselblad. And it's probably wherever I put it. (Laughter) But, unfortunately, I just don't happen to know where that is. I guess that's really the only piece of operating equipment that I've misplaced. Well, that's pretty good, considering the shambles that this place generally stays in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 51 53 Mattingly:</b> It's really puzzling. I've been sitting here - one of the reasons I'm not saying an awful lot is I'm trying to get some kind of an idea in my head as to how you describe the differences between the front and the back [side] materials. And that's really hard. Because every time you look for a - an objective thing, you really kind of find that there's a lot of similarities, when you get down to the details. It's not clear that the back side is - would be that much different from the front if we put a few mares in there and a couple of - of the big rilles.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 52 47 Mattingly:</b> One of the things that I noticed about - most of the craters on the back side, the larger ones - even the ones with the steep interiors - do not have any kind of a - a block ejecta around the outsides. You know. I shouldn't say none, but it's very seldom - You have to stop and look for each block. But there are a few craters like - Chaplygin, and - a couple like that that - in fact, have large blocks around the outside. King is another one that has - The outer flanks of King look very much like the central feature in the interior.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 53 51 Mattingly:</b> And I got North and South Ray again and - </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 53 57 Hartsfield:</b> John and Charlie are at Station 5 now, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 54 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess I really can't say I see them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 54 12 Hartsfield:</b> They're packing up to move on down to Station 6 now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 54 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I can see one, two, three distinct layers and it looks like several streams of material that go from the interior of South Ray over to - One of them points out, goes in South Ray and over the lip and down the outside. And it points over towards Baby Ray. And I'm trying to look at the material - All those things we said we could see, all those lineaments and things that we looked at back in the furrow of Descartes just don't show, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 54 56 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 54 58 Mattingly:</b> And I'm looking down into the floor of Dollond T, and it looks like Dollond T has two different units: one that kind of floods in from the west - looks like it sort of fills the floor there. All that stuff that we talked about and all those things we looked at on the plotter are apparently below the resolution of what I can see with these binoculars. And, in general, as the Sun comes up, my first impression at the lower Sun was that the material to the - of Stone and Smoky were the same and that the Descartes furrowed material was also part of the same thing. As the Sun angle comes up, it starts to change its character a little bit, and it's looking more like the plotter photos. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 56 38 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. It sure seems that the Sun angle really affects what - what you're able to see. And - I guess you're about ready to look at Alphonsus. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 56 53 Mattingly:</b> That's correct.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 57 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We're just coming up on Albategnius and Klein now. Boy, I wish we could get a couple more of those - forward oblique photo passes. That was the one time when the windows were really pointing in the direction you'd like to have them. Other than that, you have a permanent crick in your neck. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>145 58 14 Mattingly:</b> I've looked at Alphonsus on quite a few of our revs; and, at the lower Suns, there was absolutely no - nothing I could say about dark halos around those little craters. Now, this time, I look at them, and there's a very obvious dark halo. It looks exactly like the dark halos you see around the two craters to the south of Theophilus. I've looked for some topographic or - or surface feature that might he different between the northern and southern halves of Alphonsus, and I've had absolutely no luck at all with that. I see now one, two, three distinct, dark halo areas and probably a fourth one. The rim of Alphonsus and the rim of Ptolemaeus are inseparable - where I am right now. I haven't quite gotten to it yet. The long, north-south trending lineament that runs through Alphonsus looks just like the photographs. It does indeed run up there, and it runs through the wall, and looks like it's an extension of the little crater chain that runs through Ptolemaeus. Halley fill in the floor of Ptolemaeus looks just like it does in Alphonsus. I don't see any - any really significant difference. The only thing I can say about the dark halo areas in Alphonsus - is that - Well, I can't get the binoculars on them because I can't get close enough to the window.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 00 18 Mattingly:</b> If you remember that one we looked at the blowups of, I'm looking at that now, and - Yeah, there's a slight albedo difference or a darkening of the material around the - It doesn't look any different than any other crater down there. It's filled in on the western flank. It has a slightly raised rim around the eastern side. It's very subtle. It looks very subdued. It looks just like all the rest of the craters that you see all over the rest of the Moon. Nothing significant about it - except in its setting. I really don't see any relationship between Davy and Davy's chain with any other feature that shows in either Ptolemaeus or the surroundings. The main token - I can't even get over far enough to take a good look at - at Alpetragius. [Garble] is just about out of the field of view. And one thing I am gonna try to take a look at, and I don't know if we have enough Sun yet, and I'm gonna use these light level - red and blue filters, and take a look at Lassell C. And see whether or not there's any enhancement that's comparable to what we've seen with the photographs with the red and [garble]. blue filters.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 02 20 Mattingly:</b> And just looking at these things directly through the filters, you don't - you don't see anything there at all. I didn't really think you would, but I thought it was an interesting thing to try. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 02 37 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 02 38 Mattingly:</b> And I can see a lot of the - that little crater that's out to the west of Lassell C, the one that looks like it has a little cone [garble], is very obvious now that the Sun's come up higher; and it's - it does look a little different, but there's so many of these little craters and little mountain things that stick up through the floor of the mare that it's not real obvious that that's anything out of the ordinary.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 03 13 Hartsfield:</b> Can you see the little bright ray there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 03 19 Mattingly:</b> Say again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 03 21 Hartsfield:</b> There should be a little bright ray, I think. Isn't it? Near the suspected dark cone?</p>

And most of the highlands material that's over to the east of - of Fra Mauro itself all has the same appearance as though it's - belongs to the same pattern.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 04 35 Hartsfield:</b> You ought to be approaching the terminator now. Is that right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 04 41 Mattingly:</b> Yes sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 04 54 Mattingly:</b> And - I have been rather impressed with the fact that, in most of these little - grabens or rilles, in the low Sun, it appears to me that the floors of these things have a lower crater density in general than the outsides of the crater - the crater density on the outside of the - of the rille itself. You can see this at low Sun angle quite dramatically. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 05 35 Mattingly:</b> And just to the west of the Fra Mauro area, we've got another rille coming up, and - in places, it looks like it has a little - little ridge around it. When you get the real low Suns on this very mottled surface - it looks more like you're looking at some of those sponges and things you see in the ocean floor than it does any part of the Moon - the way it will look when the Sun comes up. </p>

      <p class="tech"><b>146 10 32 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Good readback.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 10 45 Hartsfield:</b> And if you've got your scratchpad handy, I've got a couple of comments I'd like to - questions I'd like to get up on Guyot, you mentioned a while ago.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 10 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Stand by. I'll get it. Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 11 10 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. You described this big hole with a black blob, and the question is: Is the big hole a crater, or does it look more like a volcanic vent?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 11 26 Mattingly:</b> Well, it looks to me like a - like a crater, like all the rest of the craters around here, except it occurs in the side of a - a crater wall. But - I've been looking for similar features, and there's quite a few of these big - real large craters that have similar size craters in their walls too. So I wouldn't say that's anomalous. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 11 54 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And does the blob look at all like lava?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 12 05 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Well, I can't get close enough right now to see. There's...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 12 08 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We just want you to have these questions...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 12 10 Mattingly:</b> ...two things that look like flows. One of them is a - Yeah. Well, I - obviously, that's one of the things that - and I don't think we're gonna be able to answer that question; at least, I can't. But I - it looks like - it looks just like the - material that you see coming down the side of the mountains to the north of Flagstaff. I know that's lava, but whether this is the same sort of thing or not I don't know, because there's so many places on the back side where you see what appears to be flow lines and if you follow them far enough, you find some pla - place where they get lost. Now this one is a - has a real dark set of material - and when I say real dark, I mean dark compared to the rest of the Moon. And it's - it seems to be - consisting of two different flows, or two different units: one - much lighter and closer to the regular lunar surface; both of them are darker though, and the dark ones look like the same kind of dark material - I'd say it looks the same as what you see in subtle expressions in the little domes in King and along the central peak.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 13 41 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, could you get the Laser Altimeter On, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 13 47 Mattingly:</b> Oh. Yes sir. It's on. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 13 58 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. And could you give us an estimate of how large this feature is?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 14 11 Mattingly:</b> Uh-oh. I was afraid you'd ask that. Let me get a scale on Guyot.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 14 23 Mattingly:</b> The crater is in the - almost due - west of the wall - pointing towards Lobachevsky; and I would say that the crater is about - between a quarter and a third the diameter - The diameter of the crater is between a quarter and a third the total depth from the floor of the Crater Guyot up to the rim.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 15 04 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. And - Ken, we - we - you got another opportunity to look at this thing on the next rev, I think. Our figures here show that your time of closest approach is 147:31:04. And you should be able to see it through Window 4 and then Window 3 as you go by. And, this is just for your own information, if you do want to take another look and take a stab at these questions and any other things you see about it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 15 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I've been - I commented on this thing, I thought, sometime yesterday - first time I saw it - and I've been looking at it periodically. Unfortunately, it occurs at the same time King does, and you - you get all wrapped around the axle trying to figure out which one you need to work on. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 15 59 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Just threw this out to you in case you want to take a look at it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 16 06 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. Thank you very much. I've got you a couple of pictures of it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 16 11 Mattingly:</b> Let's see. I'll try to whip off a P52 here for you before I start to exercise.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 16 43 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that's real good, Ken. We were hoping you'd donate a couple of minutes of your exercise period for that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 16 52 Mattingly:</b> I'm so far behind on exercise now that I may never exercise again. It's really gonna hurt when I get back and have to go to work. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 18 03 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, you have been getting some exercise - You haven't been omitting these exercise periods, have you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 18 11 Mattingly:</b> No. No. But that just isn't - you know, that just isn't much. I can hardly get a heart rate enough to even tell it's there. It doesn't seem like I can change it with the equipment I have. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 18 26 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Well, we want you to...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 18 28 Mattingly:</b> No. I get the exercise. It just doesn't amount to anything.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 18 29 Hartsfield:</b> ...take full advantage of all these.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 18 33 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Yeah. Well, you'll feel better when you get through, having done something like that. Even though I don't think it's enough exercise to amount to anything, it just makes you feel better. I advocate doing them. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 21 55 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we have the angles. You're clear to start.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 22 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll catch it at 00:50. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 22 27 Hartsfield:</b> And you'd better get your camera set up, Ken, for the terminator photos.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 22 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>146 22 44 Hartsfield:</b> And when you get that, just might as well do your exercise ' don't want to interfere with that. And I'll just give you a brief call prior to LOS.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>147 09 18 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay; I'm looking down at Mendeleev again, and - guess one of the things that I'm starting to notice is that - in this outer rim up here, we have a - a fairly smooth, Cayley-like looking material. It's the same as what's down on the floor, Then we have what looks like an old slump material. And on the outside of this smooth Cayley that's at the top, looks like more smooth material. It's non-pitted, which means non-Cayley. The margins of all this stuff are all very, very indistinct. Just can't see anything. There's no flow fronts, there's - </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 10 20 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> They just come together. You can see where the break is, and it's just exactly the same way it looks down there at Stone Mountain. It just isn't obvious where one unit starts and another one stops. It looks like mare material to me, but with - without the grabens and without the wrinkle ridges and with probably a larger crater count in general.</p> <a name="147_10"></a>
      <p class="ed">[Lunar Rev 38 begins at 147 10 .]</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 11 35 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> I'm looking at that big chunk in the wall where it looks like something else has run down inside. And when you get up and look at it up close, it all looks the same. You don't see that something else. That's - that's a subtle textural difference. That little area has a lot more pits, and there seems to be a lot more slump. I can look back in the shadows with the binoculars, and I see a lot of what looks like unconsolidated material. It just sort of looks like mud that exceeded its angle of repose, all slumped in there. There are craters in the walls of this slump material. Some look like they're pointing down, some like they went into the sides. Around the top, it looks like another highly cratered area. As though this top portion may have been a - a crater all its own, just like the one next to it. And then whatever dropped in this big event created Mendeleev, just sliced it off. But throughout it all, the only thing I see that's different from one place to another is just the amount of - of pockmarks that you see on these surfaces. They're all crosshatched, and thatched, and some of them show - there's one here that shows a little bending. When you look down on it, they look like nice sharp lineaments, but, boy, when you get down and look at them in detail, they just lose all that sharpness completely. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 14 07 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Why, it looks just like soil that's been torn up. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 14 54 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Mostly the back side is - is characterized with an absence of blocks. It's really devoid of constructional features. King is a - a markedly different feature than everything else we've seen. Most of the things I've seen have been up to the north. That little crater that's coming up - coming up to King looks like it's got this same material that looks like it's emanating from King, but now this stuff is coming down from the south; that may be ray material from Bruno. And I'm gonna get a picture of this little guy, because it's - </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 16 02 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Oh, that thing is probably gonna be too hard to get to. Doggone it. There it is. It looks like a baby King.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 16 26 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> That one was number 48, the magazine Victor.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 16 41 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Now I'll get a good picture of the outer materials of King; this is typical sampling. Here's a good picture of that northern rim. Looks like this stuff to the south looks very much like a flow that comes out from King. And the south mid-west looks very much like the material that's oozed out. All the material that's going out to the north - I mean, that's the south and east - all the material that's going out to the north and east has that same characteristic. There's light material that runs through there and seems to be running through - almost without any kind of rhyme or reason, go through the walls and out onto the ejecta.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 18 00 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Whole area looks different than most other places around here. Now, some of this stuff that I'm calling ejecta - I'm gonna get a picture here of what it looks like as it goes up on the rims of this adjacent crater. And looks to me like it splashes up onto this other crater, as though it all came out in a big surge. I'm not sure that's a reasonable thing to be saying. This series of King ends with frame number 50 [AS16-120-19226 to 232. The last is the 48th frame on the film]. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>147 19 20 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Well, I'll be darned. That looks - that's even different than I thought it was before. Here I got this crater that goes from the top of Guyot down; then this black stuff comes down; then all those striations around there make a pattern that swirls and curves with it. I 'm gonna have to draw a sketch of that, because I'll never be able to describe it in words. But it does indeed run right down the walls. That's really beautiful. And there's old Mother Earth. Man, that is a beauty, too.</p>

      <p class="ed">[Acquisition of Signal at 147:23.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 23 02 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 23 10 Mattingly:</b> Hello, there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 23 12 Hartsfield:</b> Hello: Ken. How'd it go on the last pass?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 23 19 Mattingly:</b> Oh, it went all the way around, came back out the front side, and I got exercise, and got some terminator pictures, and got a good look at Guyot again. I guess I'm gonna have to - gonna have to make a few corrections to my size estimate on that thing at Guyot. It looks like the crater that it's coming out of is really like half the size of the Guyot feature, instead of what I had said before: about a third. And - not only that, but the - I disc - I saw something else this time that was - also went unnoticed before. The crater is located right at the top of the rim and works its way down to about halfway, then this dark material comes out; and there's two - as I said before -there's two shades of this dark material. Then - a striation that shows up that's like all the rest of these lineaments we've been seeing all over the Moon. And I think I remember saying something as I passed Theophilus on one of our early revs right after we got here that it looked like these - these patterns that we see that are all over the surface - on the sides of every hill and every out - every vertical surface - they all seem to follow the contours of any local topography. If there's a - like in Theophilus, I first noticed it here on the crater rim - There were some other little craters up along the side, and those little craters that were up along the side left impressions down inside the - on these - these striations that run around the - the rest of the - of the Moon, or the rest of the crater interior. And that happened everywhere you looked. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 25 50 Hartsfield:</b> Could they be fractures or something like that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 25 57 Mattingly:</b> Well. That was what I was wondering: if these are shock reflections or something like that. And I guess that still is a reasonable hypothesis, except these things are all over the surface, everywhere you look - in places where you really wouldn't expect to see shocks; but, you know, maybe they're there after all.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 26 26 Hartsfield:</b> Did you happen to observe, going by King this time, anything up to the north, any expression at all of the Soviet Mountains?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 26 39 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. I've been looking for those for - quite a few revs now, and I cannot follow the rays of King outs to the north and make any conclusion at all about them. I can see some of the ray material that comes down from King, but - or it comes out from King, I should say - but I'm really having no luck at all tracing that stuff to the north. Then I started looking for this - Soviet Mountains; and, when you look north and south - way out on the horizon here - you get the impression that there's north and south trending, very subtle constructional builds. But I'm not sure that isn't just the way we're looking at it, because every time you look cross-Sun, you're gonna see that sort of pattern. Anything that's there is gonna show up, and if you put enough of these craters together, they are bound to make a line. So, I can't really say that I see one; it appears to me that if there is, there's a very, very shallow rise which, instead of calling it a mountain range, I would call it more like a plateau front similar to the Kant Plateau rise as it comes up from behind Theophilus. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 28 03 Hartsfield:</b> Could you give us High Gain, Auto position?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 28 14 Mattingly:</b> You have Auto.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 28 17 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I guess the - the Laser Altimeter is down to about 50 percent now, and - the ground track is not gonna go over that part, so we're not gonna get any laser information to give us any data on the topography in that area. And that's why we're particularly interested in your observations of whether there's actual rise in the topography there or not.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 28 42 Mattingly:</b> It's real hard to say. I'd say if there is, it's like a plateau though, Hank - very subtle.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 28 59 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, could you give us Wide Beam width and then back to Narrow?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 29 18 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. That doesn't seem to help. Let me go back and try her.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>147 31 04 Hartsfield:</b> Anything else to report on your back side observations, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 31 15 Mattingly:</b> Say again, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 31 16 Hartsfield:</b> Do you have any other comments about the back side observations?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 31 28 Mattingly:</b> No. I guess there's some stuff around King there again that's just - the more I study that one feature, the more I see with it, which is sort of what you'd expect. And it's kind of nice because it's right on the ground track so often. Looks like there's a lot of material that I would call an ejecta blanket that comes out from it. It seems to climb up the sides of craters around it, surrounding it. And it looks definitely like there's some kind of a - of a flow - again, I would characterize it more as a mud flow than anything else. It looks like it comes out of that south-eastern corner - the stuff that goes out to the northeast and to the northwest is all - looks like it comes out a lot faster. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 32 23 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Can you see any expression of that central feature out to the north?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 32 32 Mattingly:</b> Say again, please.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 32 34 Hartsfield:</b> The central feature there - the "Y" in King crater - can you see any expression of that out to the north - through the north wall of the crater, up toward the north?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 32 48 Mattingly:</b> No. No better than you can looking at the photographs. There's a lot of light material up there that has what looks like dark material sticking through it. It looks that way very obviously - looks like there's rocks and - it's still hard to determine if those are rocks or if those are shadows, but I've seen it a couple of times looking back from the - from west to east, and it still looks like - hard - shadow, so it must be our - it must be dark material or a block at least, rather than shadows.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>147 52 21 Mattingly:</b> Boy, as the Sun angle comes up now, the features in the landing area are really fading out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 52 55 Mattingly:</b> There's more evidence of terracing and banding in Smoky Mountain than there is in Cone, it looks like.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 53 11 Hartsfield:</b> How close are they going to get to that on this...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 53 13 Mattingly:</b> On this Sun angle, I can see one, two - Say again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 53 18 Hartsfield:</b> I was just curious to how close they were going to get those bands on their trip to North Ray.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 53 27 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. Well, the other thing is that they were going to go down to Ravine, and it looks to me like the material at Ravine is about the same material that around North Ray. If they get there and come up the way they're scheduled to, it looks like they're going to be on the same unit that they would have gotten down at Ravine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 53 54 Mattingly:</b> You really have to look at this stuff in all Sun angles because you see different things from hour to hour. It's really amazing. How we doing on the Pan Camera?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 54 06 Hartsfield:</b> Still got a little over a minute to go. I'll give you a call.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 54 12 Mattingly:</b> All right, sir. It sure looks like that stuff that comes into the - looks like North Ray was blasted into a piece of Smoky Mountain - what it really looks like. And that the Smoky Mountain and the stuff out to the - to the east of there is really probably all from the same stuff.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 55 10 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, about 15 seconds to T-start.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 55 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we're Operate. Barber pole and a gray.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 55 35 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 58 49 Mattingly:</b> You know, it's very interesting that down there at Alpetragius, there's a lot of the linear features that line up with the Imbrium sculpture. They come right down, come through Alpetragius, go through the central peak, come right through the southern wall, and go on out, and one of them goes on down and hits the rim of Arzachel.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 59 16 Hartsfield:</b> That sounds pretty interesting there, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>147 59 22 Mattingly:</b> I'm looking at Lassell C and the little highlands clump that's by it. And - remember, we had a red and a blue color difference, and right now the Southern Pease with a crater in it is sort of a - a tan color, and the Northern Pease is a gray. When I look at the mare, I see a big swatch of - of the tan-colored mare down to the south that goes over towards Guericke. And I see a - a tongue of darker gray material. The area around Lassell C has the tan tone to it. Then it goes out about as far as our little cone and the little bright crater next to it. That's about the outer limit - maybe just a little beyond. Then there's a patch of the - of this tan stuff that's down to the south that about lines up with the big Achaean rille that's over to the southeast. Then there's a patch in the gray-colored mare down inside of that. It's just a little circular piece. In looking at the Lassell C feature - a look at it in detail - it appears to me that this tan stuff on the south end of it has fewer craters than the stuff on the north, although not an awful lot, but there's little pitted craters all over the northern part. They're not on the southern parts and there are a couple of light, streaked bands that appear in the southern clump that you don't see in the north.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 01 31 Hartsfield:</b> Can you still see Lassell?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 01 37 Mattingly:</b> Say again, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 01 38 Hartsfield:</b> Can you still see Lassell?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 01 47 Mattingly:</b> Just barely, yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 01 49 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I'm just curious why we don't see that little dark feature that's been reported there near the bright one - up to the west of Lassell C. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 02 01 Mattingly:</b> Oh, you do, Hank. I didn't mean to say you didn't see it. I said it doesn't look like what we saw before - what we thought we saw. It's a smooth sided thing. Let me get the binocs on it. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 02 34 Mattingly:</b> Smooth-sided, but through the binoculars, it doesn't look at all like a cone. It looks like a little dome with one side of it broken out. And there are several other little domes out here now that I hadn't seen before.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 03 00 Hartsfield:</b> When you say side broken out, do you mean like a - a - a - fractured-out piece, or did it look more like a crater? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 03 13 Mattingly:</b> Well, through the - to the visual - just to your eyeball, it looks like a - I'll have to catch that again later, but it looked, to the eyeball, like it had a little crater in it. When I got the binoculars on it, it looked like there was just a section of it that was broken out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 03 35 Hartsfield:</b> Any evidence of where it went?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 03 43 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. That's a loaded question.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 03 50 Hartsfield:</b> Roger (laughter).</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>148 04 00 Hartsfield:</b> Do the other - Are the other domes similar in appearance to that one?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 04 06 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. They're not as large, and I hadn't seen those before just now. They're right in the corner of the window, as usual. It's going to take a little work to find them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 04 21 Hartsfield:</b> Are they all complete, or do they have pieces missing also?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 04 37 Mattingly:</b> Hank, I just saw them at the time I mentioned them. And best I could tell, they are complete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 04 45 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>148 04 49 Mattingly:</b> But I'll have to take another look. You know, I could have been - I could have got caught with a crater that inverted on me too. I am going to have to look carefully to make sure I didn't do that.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>149 23 04 Mattingly:</b> Oh, it doesn't do a thing. There's apparently just a little bit of polarizing done by the windows. And as I rotate the filter, why, it brightens and dims the scene just slightly. And I checked it against different types of material - the darker materials and the lighter things. And they all seemed to respond exactly the same way. I can't see any - I can't see any effects of polarizing from the surface reflection at all.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 23 40 Hartsfield: </b> I believe I would have expected a difference.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 23 57 Mattingly:</b> That time as I went by King, I took a look at a little different approach. I started out with the central peak and I tried to follow it to the worth. And it appeared to me that perhaps those central peak three prongs - I was looking at the crater blocks that are on them. And then I looked at the floor, and there's a lot of crater blocks that are laying on the floor in between the two main tongues of that central fork. The - it appears to me now that maybe there were three of those pieces of central peak that run out instead of two and that perhaps they curve a little bit over to the right. Because you do see a line of the light material that continues on to the north for quite a distance that's the same thing we have seen on the photos. The first time that I've been able to see any continuous chain that goes between the central peak into the walls. And I'd like to look one more time, and see if there's any variation in the number of blocks that I see as I look circumferentially around the wall. Perhaps there is - Where the expression of the central peak goes through, I may find a higher concentration of blocks. That's what I'd like to look for next. But it looks like perhaps those - if those central features do go through the wall, that they must take a slight curve to the right. As the Sun angle comes down, these things that I reported as swirls look more and more like swirls than they did at the higher Sun, which is just backwards from what I would have anticipated, and ...</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>149 27 58 Hartsfield: </b> Your comment that there may be a third fork in that thing is kind of interesting. You can - If you use imagination, you might see it in a photograph, although I'm not too sure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 28 13 Mattingly:</b> Well, that's kind of a - that's kind of tenuous thing to be saying. I'm going to have to look some more; but I was - I - I started by tracing the blocks down the ridge in one of the peaks and then following it. And it looked - it curved, and I just followed it around. And sure enough, it looked like you hit a place along the wall where there might have been a higher concentration of blocks. And in the length of time you're overhead with this window orientation, that's about - you just can - you get this in little bitty bits and pieces. That's where that Polaroid sure would be nice.

      <p class="tech"><b>149 37 36 Hartsfield: </b> Okay, Ken. We left off, I think, about 150 hours.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 37 43 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 37 45 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. That SIM code should be, "Plus all l's" and then, "0, all 2's."</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>149 38 05 Hartsfield: </b> And at the same time, we want to delete the "PC, Standby" through the "PC, Operate (T-start)." Want to keep the comment in there about the image motion.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>149 38 36 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. At 150:10, delete the Pan Camera photo pad.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 38 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that pad's deleted.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 38 50 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. And starting there at about 150:13, we want to delete everything except - Maybe I ought to read off what we ought to delete. Delete the "Pan Camera, Mono." Delete the "Pan Camera, Standby." We want to keep the Mapping Camera stuff. Delete "Pan Camera, Off." Delete the - Stand by.</p>

Delete "P00, enable all jets." Delete the Verb 49 maneuver thing, both lines, and the high gain remark. And that should leave us with "Mapping Camera, Off (T-stop) Wait 30 seconds.

      <p class="tech"><b>149 40 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I concur.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 40 35 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. And in addition, back up at 150:18 now, we want to add in there, "Mass Spec, Ion Source, On - up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 40 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You want to add the "Mass Spec, Ion Source, On" at 150:14.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 41 02 Hartsfield: </b> That's affirmative, sir. And we - we still got the urine dump in there. And at 150:30, the experiment status should be "Plus 1110, 01222."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 41 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's "Plus all 1's, 01222."</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>149 41 52 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 41 53 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. And right after that, we want to delete both of those P52s. Both the Option 3 and the Option 1.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 42 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, they're deleted.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 42 12 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. That does it for now, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 42 17 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) It didn't leave much, did it? I'll tell you one thing...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 42 23 Hartsfield: </b> [garble]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 42 24 Mattingly:</b> ...I want to squeeze in here somewhere, and I'm not sure we're at the right place to do it. But I have yet to pick up a star pattern in the telescope. And I'm going to take one of these backside areas here and make a concerted effort to that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 42 39 Hartsfield: </b> All righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 42 41 Mattingly:</b> But I can see plenty of stars all over the place outside, and I just can't see a thing through that telescope. And I know we could when we were in Earth orbit, because the first thing I thought was that we didn't have it, and then I waited until we got around and looked at a bright part of the sky, and we got hold of Scorpion. It was there and it was all beautiful. And now, I look out there and it's just - there's just nothing there. It's just black. And that's after getting well dark adapted.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 43 13 Hartsfield: </b> Where did they go?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 43 17 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) I don't know. Maybe it was their eat period. They're all out to lunch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 44 22 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Henry.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 44 25 Hartsfield: </b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 44 30 Mattingly:</b> You know, we were gonna separate the - the water dump from the other dumps on one of these passes somewhere. And I don't know where that is, but I - We're not getting very much collected, and we probably ought to - I think I'll just hang onto it until it comes time to use it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 44 55 Hartsfield: </b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 46 55 Mattingly:</b> I'm looking at the little bright crater that has the ray-excluded zone that's just south of M�dler, and it looks like there is a little bit of - like there's a little topographic high that runs right down one ridge of that ray-excluded zone. That's the one that goes through the south. And it looked like there was a little dark material in there, and maybe on another pass, I'll get a chance to see it better.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 47 37 Hartsfield: </b> Where is it you're looking, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 47 43 Mattingly:</b> Say again, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 47 46 Hartsfield: </b> Where - where are you looking, now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 47 51 Mattingly:</b> That's a little bright crater with a ray-excluded zone that's just about south of M�dler. And I'm looking at M�dler now, and that stuff that makes the bright ray material going out the - to the east seems to come up to the rim. You can see it - It's brighter in that area along going down the - inside of the rim. Then there's a bright streak that runs across the central area, right across and up the other side. And then it sort of stops when it gets to the other rim. But there's a faint evidence of a - of another continuation of that streak.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 48 37 Hartsfield: </b> And that's in M�dler?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 48 42 Mattingly:</b> That's in M�dler, yes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 50 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay. In this higher Sun, it sure appears that the - the bright things that run down into - come out of the Descartes bright spot and run north, seem to be centered around - that's Dollond - I guess that's Dollond B or A - whatever that thing is. I tried to trace the boundaries and all this material that's in what we call the furrowed Descartes that runs up and it becomes part of Smoky Mountain. That material looks just exactly like most of that stuff on the back side, except it may be a little bit darker, and I think that's the Sun angle. That whole area has that same characteristic to me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 52 00 Hartsfield: </b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 52 12 Hartsfield: </b> You remember that northwest-southeast trending we saw in the vicinity of North Ray that looked like it was some offsets in those grabens? Can you see any of that in there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 52 27 Mattingly:</b> Just a second. I'm not sure about that. But it does appear to me as if the - the floor that the LM has landed on is indeed a different unit that sticks in, and it's more part of this Cayley material that's farther out to the - to the west. And it does go back just about the way we had drawn the boundaries. Say again your question? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 52 53 Hartsfield: </b> I just remember on a plotter, we looked at what appeared to be some graben that came across Smoky Mountain and down to the southeast of it and going back up the northwest. And they were all offset like they may have been some faulting in that area. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 53 12 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, I'm not sure what that all is, Hank. That same texture that has many patterns and linear lines and they make a kind of a hash, but that same thing appears all over the - the surface when you look at it in detail. I think I can probably take a picture of most any one of these places down here and analyze it in depth and come up with a very similar picture. And especially the things on the back side look exactly like that Descartes area. It's just that Descartes area is a very small place. And you see so much on the back side that covers that same kind of thing. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 54 00 Hartsfield: </b> John and Charlie reported - I guess it's just south of - between where the LM landed and - and Stone Mountain - what appeared to be subdued crater that was some 300 meters in diameter and maybe 50 meters deep that didn't show on our map. Were you able - Can you detect something like that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 54 25 Mattingly:</b> You know, there's so much noise down there, Hank, I can hardly understand you. Would you say again? Sounds like you're trying to shout over a football game.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 54 34 Hartsfield: </b> Roger. I'll try again, I guess. John and Charlie reported a very large crater, maybe some 300 meters in diameter, that was between the LM site and Stone Mountain. They were on their way back from Station 8, and this thing wasn't on their maps, but it was very obvious to them as they were driving. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 02 Mattingly:</b> I'll look and see. I really hadn't taken the time to compare features just one by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 19 Hartsfield: </b> Ken, could you give us a barber pole on Image Motion?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay, barber pole on the IMC.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 30 Hartsfield: </b> That's one I - slipped by...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 31 Mattingly:</b> There it is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 32 Hartsfield: </b> ...me when I got to talking.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 37 Mattingly:</b> I'm sorry. Say again?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 39 Hartsfield: </b> I let that one slip by me when I got to talking to you about the landing site.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 55 46 Mattingly:</b> Uh-oh. I think you'd go a long ways before you get very far behind.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 57 14 Hartsfield: </b> Casper, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 57 20 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 57 21 Hartsfield: </b> Roger. So far, we haven't seen anything - a smear [?] or anything requesting that urine dump by itself. So that thing is still in question. Your next urine dump would be scheduled for 20 hours from now. But it's also scheduled in conjunction with a water dump, et cetera. So I don't know where that thing stands. We're gonna check into it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 57 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It'll probably take me another 20 hours to make it worthwhile.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 57 49 Hartsfield: </b> Roger (laughter).</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 58 28 Mattingly:</b> Golly.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>149 59 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. I got a better visual on that little thing we called a cone, and I guess it looks like it is a crater in the top of it. And from where I am, it looks like the southern end of it, which is away from me, probably has just about reached down level with the mare floor. The rest of it is just a smooth cone that sticks up. It does have some small craters on it. The rim looks relatively sharp, and there's a couple of fractures go through it. Its texture and albedo do not look significantly different than the mare around it. There is a little expression of perhaps a subtle depression around the eastern side of it that looks like it might be a little flow characteristic there. I'm going to shift my gaze down to these other two features, and I guess - my guess is I really had those things reversed. They in fact were shallow craters. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 00 36 Hartsfield: </b> Hey, that does sound more like a little vein or a cone to me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 00 43 Mattingly:</b> Well, it just looks so much like all the rest of the things around here, Hank. The texture of the surface looks like it is all the same. The flanks of it are fairly steep though. And it's got one of the sharper rims for a raised rim crater of any that I've seen.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 25 minutes. The Lunar Module cabin pressure is back now to about its normal level of around 5 pounds per square inch. During the next hour and half Duke and Young will be getting things clean up, stowed in the cabin, getting out of their suits and that will be followed by a debriefing on the EVA. We'll then allow them about 30 to 45 minutes to eat. They'll recharge the potable life support systems in preparation for the 3rd EVA tomorrow. And get ready for an 8 hour rest period which is scheduled to begin at about 154 hours 30 minutes. During the 2nd EVA while Young and Duke were on the lunar surface, Ken Mattingly in the Command Module Casper was making good progress carrying out all his flight plan activities, photography and operating the experiments in the scientific instrument module bay of the service module. Flight Director Donald Puddy who has been following the activities of the CSM reports that everything is looking good with the spacecraft and the experiments. With one relatively one minor exception the laser altimeter is returning about 50 percent useable data. About 1 out of every 2 altimeter readings that we're getting back is not usable. But with that exception, all the SIM bay experiments appear to be functioning properly. And Mattingly is reported to be in good spirits. Very chipper with the words that Don Puddy used in describing him. And things going very well aboard Casper. At the present time the CSM is in its 39th revolution of the Moon. And we'll be losing radio contact about 15 more minutes as Ken Mattingly goes around the corner behind the Moon. When we next see him about 45 minutes thereafter he'll be in his 40th revolution.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 01 42 Mattingly:</b> And as we come over here - we're coming up on the Fra Mauro, Bonpland, and Parry combination, and I think that's - that's Parry that has - looks like two - almost right-angle rilles running through it. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 02 18 Mattingly:</b> I'm looking at Rima Parry. I don't remember the number. It's the western one that runs out of Fra Mauro. And it seems like it is more than just my imagination that says that the floor of that stuff is indeed smoother than the - has fewer large craters than you see in the surrounding areas, although it's pretty close to being equal in small craters.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 04 01 Hartsfield: </b> Casper, you're coming up on T-stop.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 04 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay, it's Off for 30 seconds.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>150 06 33 Hartsfield: </b> And did I hear you say Image Motion, Off?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 06 38 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 06 41 Hartsfield: </b> Okay, I guess...</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>150 06 56 Hartsfield: </b> Okay, I guess that about cleans that up...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 06 58 Mattingly:</b> And it's Closed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 07 28 Hartsfield: </b> Okay, Casper. I have a - a - a block data pad for you and some Flight Plan changes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 07 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Why don't you start with the Flight Plan changes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 07 42 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. At 151 hours, and - we want to - let's see, 151...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 07 54 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Hank. Hey, Hank. Have you got two loops punched up? Have you got two loops punched up? The noise is getting louder and louder. It sounds like I got - I'm trying to listen to you over a football game. And I can hardly hear you over the din of everything else. I don't know whether you need to hold the mike closer to your mouth, or whether you got another loop punched up and I'm getting cross-feed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 08 20 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. Let's try again, Ken. How do you read now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 08 26 Mattingly:</b> That sounds a little better.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 08 28 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. I've told them to hold it down a little, too. At 151 hours, the SIM code should be "Plus 1110, 01222."</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>150 09 53 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. You want to look at that right now? I got one small change.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 10 02 Mattingly:</b> Well, I almost got it. The old - Oh, wait a minute. You - What page did you give me?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>150 10 21 Mattingly:</b> Ah so. It's the same volume I'm in. We passed the other volume and I went back for that. Okay. All right, 311. You're ahead of me. Okay, I got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 10 37 Hartsfield: </b> Okay, this is the only bistatic we gonna do.

We're in a different attitude.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 11 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I start where it says, "Configure comm for S-band." And I stop where - including, I assume, the high gain settings.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>150 22 13 Hartsfield: </b> Roger. Because you're going to configure it here at LOS. And the word is on the - the high gain angles, believe your meter. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 22 24 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll use the meters.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 22 28 Hartsfield: </b> And some more on this configure. We're coming up here on LOS. Apparently, it's important that the DSE be configured on a - a time. It depends on when they start to rewind. So for this rev, they want you to configure the DSE at 150:45.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 22 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay. 150:45 as opposed to 43. All righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 23 40 Hartsfield: </b> And, Ken, I got one more thing for you, a TEI pad, a block data.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 23 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Stand by while I get my other book.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 24 24 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm ready to copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 24 25 Hartsfield: </b> Okay, Ken. And to let you know what's going on here, we were going to give you a TEI-54 pad, and they're jockeying around - and - because of the plane change. And the plane change is gonna come about 169 hours. So they're gonna give you a TEI-48 pad now, and give you a TEI-55 pad at about 164 hours. So this'll be TEI-48, SPS/G&amp;N; 38620; plus 0.59, plus 1.25; 168 - </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 25 16 Mattingly:</b> Hank, I - I can't hear you again. How about asking - asking the comm guy downstairs if he can patch it differently or something.

      <p class="tech"><b>150 25 47 Hartsfield: </b> Ken, how do you read now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 25 53 Mattingly:</b> Well, that little burst was good, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 25 55 Hartsfield: </b> Okay, let's try it again. There's been a lot of noise in the room...</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>150 26 17 Hartsfield: </b> Okays Ken. We'll try it again...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 26 18 Mattingly:</b> Hanks it sounds just like the other loops are - </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 26 26 Hartsfield: </b> Can you read me all right now, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 26 35 Mattingly:</b> No, I can't, Hank. It's - it's - Unkey your mike a second. Let me tell you what it sounds like. It - it sounds like that we've got the other loop - the other air-to-ground or the Flight Director's loop or something like that that's got a Vox key that comes on, and I don't hear it when you make a short statement. But when you're on for - and hold it down for any length of time, then all this other talking comes on, and it sounds like I can probably hear Tony and I'm not sure who all else. Nothing is very clear. It is exceptionally noisy, and it just sounds like - sounds like trying to hold a conversation in a football game - is what it sounds like. And it's been - it's been annoying, but now it's getting to the place where I can't even read you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 27 25 Hartsfield: </b> Okays it - it must be coming from somewhere else, Ken. We've got everybody in the room real quiet now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 27 34 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I - I don't think it's possible (laughter) for all that noise to be coming through from your open mike. That's the reason I wanted to see if Comm Tech could chase it out or something.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 27 48 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. We're about 2 minutes from LOS. I don't guess we're going to be able to get this pad to you, and we're not going to see you for another rev, about 3 hours.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 28 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, I'm not gonna - I'm not gonna burn TEI-48 in the meantime, anyhow. But I can't - I'm not gonna copy you properly if I can't hear you. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 28 12 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. We'll work on this thing and see if we can't have it better when we get comm here in a rev and a half.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 28 21 Mattingly:</b> All right. Thank you very much, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 28 23 Hartsfield: </b> Do you - do you still have the noise while we're talking now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 28 29 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. It doesn't come on immediately as soon as you start to talk. It - it builds up slowly, like you start to talk and then it takes about 1001, 1002, and then it comes on like a big rush. And it just swells up and after a couple of seconds, you're completely drowned out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 28 51 Hartsfield: </b> Okay. It must be in the lines. They're checking now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 28 57 Mattingly:</b> All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>150 29 10 Mattingly:</b> And I promise we won't go anywhere in the meantime. </p>

You heard Ken Mattingly describe a communications problem, apparently on the uplink. We were getting good solid noise free communications from the Command Module but he described a situation that sounded as if there were at first background noise coming in from the room here but on evaluating it, it became obvious that this was not noise pickup from the Capcom's mike but was rather something that was getting into the lines. We have the network communications officer checking into the situation to see if we can have it resolved prior to the next acquisition of Casper.

      <p class="tech"><b>153 16 01 Roosa: </b> Okay. That takes care of that question.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 16 33 Roosa: </b> And, Ken, awhile ago you were reporting loud background noise. We'd like to ask you how the comm is now.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 17 05 Roosa: </b> And, Ken, any time you're ready, I've got some Flights Plan updates. We lied to you while ago when I said we were through for the day. And I've got a TEI-48 pad.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 17 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Why don't you give me the Flight Plan first.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 17 36 Mattingly:</b> All righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 17 37 Roosa: </b> Okay; and the reason why we're doing this is the cabin is coming up a little bit and we're going to open the waste stowage vent valve for approximately an hour. So at 154:30, we're adding "Waste Stowage Vent valve, open."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 18 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess I'm just not breathing hard enough, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 18 07 Roosa: </b> Oh, man, just great metabolism there. And over at 155:30, we can add "Waste Stowage Vent valve, Closed."</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 18 31 Roosa: </b> Okays, that will be one step off your pre-sleep checklist there, see. And after the pre-sleep checklist, we'd like to add "Accept VHF." And what we're gonna do here is get you configured for the VHF bistatic test during your sleep period, so disregard the VHF part of your pre-sleep. And at 155 ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 18 56 Mattingly:</b> You want to give me a complete...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 18 58 Roosa: </b> Yeah, we can do that. The time on that is 155:36 and you've got about six or seven lines; you might want to come out to the left there. </p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 19 16 Roosa: </b> Okay.

And then add Configure for VHF bistatic test, VHF AM T/R, three, to Receive (verify). VHF AM A, Off (verify). VHF AM B, Duplex (verify)." And "VHF Range to Range. And VHF Antenna, Right." And also right, all at the same time, Ken, right here around 155:35, we'd like to - Didn't leave you much room to write - we'd like to configure for a 2&frac12 degree deadband test. So at 155:35, we'd like "CMC, Free; P20, Noun 79, plus 00250," and then we'll go back to "Auto." Well, are you still with me, Ken, or did I leave you back on the waste stowage vent valve.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 21 43 Mattingly:</b> Let's see. I guess the last thing I heard was "Are you there." (Laughter)</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 21 54 Mattingly:</b> Right (laughter). And at about 155:30, we go to Free, take P20 and narrow the deadband to 2&frac12 degrees, then go back to Auto.

      <p class="tech"><b>153 22 32 Roosa: </b> Okay, and you, you're not going to do anything in the pre-sleep checklist with the VHF, because we've just given you all these others, and you deleted those two steps that were in there. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 22 40 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 23 06 Roosa: </b> Okay, we'd like to add "Terminate VHF bistatic test. VHF AM B, Off," and "VHF Ranging, Off."</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 23 41 Roosa: </b> Okay, and that's all the Flight Plan updates for tonight as of this moment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 23 51 Mattingly:</b> You've got to be kidding.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 23 54 Roosa: </b> Unh-unh. I've been known to lie, though.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 24 00 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) You sure have. Hey, you mentioned something yesterday about the general scheme of things to come.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 24 08 Roosa: </b> That's right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 24 10 Mattingly:</b> Is that still sort of on tap?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 24 14 Roosa: </b> Yeah, that's it pretty much. I thought somewhere along this pass we'd give you a little more detail, Specifically, on what we'd be doing tomorrow, and maybe give you times of PC1 and lift-off and so forth.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 24 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I got to thinking about it some last night, and the one thing I thought about is - I understand the desire to keep the day down to some reasonable number. If we still have to put our suits on to jettison the LM the next day, that's gonna chew up quite a few hours. And if that doesn't make any difference, why that's okay, if there's nothing else for us to do during those hours. But it seems like that's - to take those suits off and then put them back on and take them off again, with three guys in here it becomes a real big operation. I guess that sort of, would seem to me, might be an option that maybe John would have an opinion on when he gets back tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 25 37 Roosa: </b> Okay. We copy that, Ken. just stand by a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 25 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm not proposing you change it. I'm just suggesting you consider the big flap that goes on when three guys have to suit up in here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 25 55 Roosa: </b> Yeah, I guess. We're certainly aware of that, Ken, and the name of the game on this one is going to be dock with the LM and transfer across with just a minimum transfer, bring the rock boxes and your suits and the box, and that's about it. And then the next day, complete the LM transfer and so forth. The name of the game is to get to bed. And that's why the decision is made that way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 26 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay. All right. That's just fine then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 26 38 Roosa: </b> Yeah, they've pretty well set a limit here that we're aiming at, Ken, and that's an 18-hour day, considering the EVAs and your long day. So that's about the only way it would work.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 26 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 27 16 Roosa: </b> And along that way tomorrow - we'll of course have the update for you later, but we are going to have to schedule a urine dump with the mass spec. So we'll get that.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>153 28 32 Roosa: </b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 28 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay. All set, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 28 41 Roosa: </b> Okay. That'll be TEI-48, SPS/G&amp;N; 38620; plus 0.59, plus 1.25; 168:51:56.94; plus 3052.2, plus 0704.2, minus 0137.4; 182, 117, 014. The rest of the pad NA. Comments: the GDC align same as for circ; ullage, two jets, 17 seconds; longitude at T minus 172.00. Additional comments. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 30 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 30 10 Roosa: </b> Pad based on loading site REFSMMAT, assumed no plane change.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 30 18 Mattingly:</b> All righty, that's TEI-48, SPS/G&amp;N; 38620; plus 0.59, plus 1.25; 168:51:56.94; plus 3052.2, plus 0704.2, minus 0137.4; 182, 117, 014; GDC alignment goes with the circ pad, two jets, 17 seconds. Lambda ignition, minus 172.00. Pad is based on the descent REFSMMAT, and no plane change.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 31 00 Roosa: </b> Okay, that sounds like a good readback. We got that beauty in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 31 25 Roosa: </b> And, Ken, we'd like Pan Camera Power, Off, now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 31 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Pan Camera Power's coming Off. And it's Off now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 31 36 Roosa: </b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 31 56 Mattingly:</b> I got a chance to go back and look at the telescope on one of the last two revs, and found out the problem was that even after I had gone back and taped the eyepieces back on, they still had the tape on them, but the darned things had slipped out of focus with the telescope. And I guess it was far enough out of focus that it - the stars just weren't bright enough to show up. Because while I was sitting there looking in it I could focus it and then the stars would appear and disappear if I defocused it. So I refocused the eyepiece and the telescope works like you'd expect a telescope to work.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 32 37 Roosa: </b> That little bit of troubleshooting sounds like another first for 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 32 51 Mattingly:</b> Well, I never would have thought about that thing coming off if I hadn't found the eyepiece floating by me one day.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 32 59 Roosa: </b> Oh, now why did you blow your image.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 33 25 Mattingly:</b> What are the surface guys doing now - are they cleaning up after the EVA?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 33 32 Roosa: </b> Roger. They're going through their cleanup, and they've had their debriefing, and I guess they're looking for them to try and be asleep in a couple of hours, or something like that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 33 47 Mattingly:</b> Good show. How long was the EVA today? Seven and a half?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 33 55 Roosa: </b> It was close to that, Ken, 07:23.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 34 03 Mattingly:</b> Oh, that's pretty good. Guess the little Rover did a good job.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 34 10 Roosa: </b> Yeah, it, I didn't -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 34 11 Mattingly:</b> Hank just told me they found their way up to Cinco.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 34 14 Roosa: </b> Yeah. I didn't get a chance to watch too much of that, but I did see one, when they were up on the southern point, they put the camera out on South Ray and it was just magnificent.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 34 33 Mattingly:</b> Oh. Save those tapes, I'd like to see that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 35 34 Mattingly:</b> What kind of funny did you notice on the bistatic? Was it just not getting any VHF signal?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 35 44 Roosa: </b> Well, we didn't have it initially, and then some of the words I heard was that we were getting a signal but it was not reflecting properly. And then we picked it up somewhere passing over the landing site and got some data. So I guess I'll have to get a better recap of - of that pass, but I guess - I guess the signal was there but just - just not hitting the right reflecting point. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 36 20 Mattingly:</b> Well, I'm just impressed that you can bounce a signal off the Moon that's as weak as this one and catch it back at Earth anyhow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 36 29 Roosa: </b> Yeah, and it's really not much of a switch, Ken, because we're going to run it through the night here anyway.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 36 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Hey, when I turn the waste vent on for an hour here, would it - would it make any difference to the mass spec people or anyone like that if I plugged in the black bag for a few minutes?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 37 07 Roosa: </b> Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 39 40 Roosa: </b> Okay, Ken, we have a Go from all hands to vent the bag.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 39 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We do appreciate that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 39 52 Roosa: </b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 40 23 Mattingly:</b> What's your prognosis on the Pan Camera? Is it getting us any good data, or is it gonna be kind of sloppy?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 40 40 Roosa: </b> Okay, Ken, we're - as I mentioned yesterday, it looks like we're overexposing about one f-stop, and there's a lot of, you know - we'll take that out in the processing, and everybody feels like the data is real good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 40 59 Mattingly:</b> Outstanding.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 43 51 Roosa: </b> And, Ken, as you whip by the site over there, if we could get you to put the Gamma Ray Shield on Center.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 44 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Do you want it now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 44 05 Roosa: </b> That's affirm.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 44 06 Mattingly:</b> Or did you want me to wait? Okay, here it comes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 44 11 Roosa: </b> Sorry about that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 44 14 Mattingly:</b> It's on now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 44 15 Roosa: </b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 45 34 Mattingly:</b> I was looking at the little dark halo craters around M�dler, and the one that's directly to the - yeah - east of M�dler has white streaks in it. I guess that's fair if - If light craters can bare dark streaks, I guess dark craters ought to be able to have light streaks in them. I don't know what that means to anybody.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 46 01 Roosa: </b> Copy. That seems fair.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 49 26 Mattingly:</b> Here's a little beauty that's just - just to the south of the landing site. It's off a big tall dome, and it's got all this - a great white rayed crater in the top of it. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 49 47 Mattingly:</b> I'm looking at North Ray now, and it seems to me that that stuff that runs up on the North Ray comes right around the corner. It comes from out in the area back behind what we used to call the - </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 51 18 Mattingly:</b> Just as I was coming up on the landing site that time, I saw this - little, very soft dome sitting up, and it's got this bright white ray crater right in the top of it. It's just like a - the crater itself looks like South Ray, and the - except it's built up on top of this nice little dome. And I don't know if that's coincidental, or what, but it sure is an interesting thing. The crater is about a third the size of the dome itself. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 52 00 Roosa: </b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 52 22 Roosa: </b> And, Ken, have you been mumbling any geologic terms to yourself the last couple of passes?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 52 32 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. I - during that bistatic, I just kept quiet inside, too.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 52 40 Roosa: </b> Okay. How were things around on the other side?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 52 42 Mattingly:</b> That was a good chance for me to - Yeah, that was a good chance for me to - to get caught up on all the housekeeping and loose ends, and kind of pick up some stuff here and there. That was a - a well needed break. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 53 02 Roosa: </b> I certainly agree.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 54 21 Mattingly:</b> Hey, you know, looking down at this - this material that's to the north of Albatregius - Albategnius, that is - excuse me. That material, if you didn't have all these craters around it, that terrain scene could have been placed on the back side almost anywhere. Got exactly the same characteristics as the scene - everything about it's the same as a big share of what we call Cayley and other stuff. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 54 59 Roosa: </b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 55 03 Mattingly:</b> And the Cayley floor fill I see in Ptolemaeus. And all of these things look exactly like what you see in Mendeleev. I've been looking for something I could say was different. I don't see a thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 55 20 Roosa: </b> Okay. That sounds like a good observation.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 55 49 Mattingly:</b> Look at Alphonsus. I'm looking at the eastern or the dark gray craters, the one that's almost due east of the central peak, the largest ring deposit there. And to the unaided eye, it stands out quite dramatically. When I put the binoculars on it, the difference is extremely subtle. You really have to look for it, and then it just turns out to be a slightly different color, but I can't say anything at all about any difference in textures or any other thing that's different except that there's a slightly different color to it. But it's more obvious to the unaided eye than it is to the eye with magnification.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 56 42 Roosa: </b> Okay, Ken. I guess what you're trying to say is when you get too close to the forest you can't see the trees, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>153 56 57 Mattingly:</b> That must be.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 01 17 Mattingly:</b> Looks like most of these medium-size craters out here in Cognitum are - they have raised rims, but they're very smooth raised rims, and they kind of - they have a convex instead of a concave side to them. It's - very much like the little suspected cone we saw next to Lassell C. It's just that he's by himself out there, and as you get into Cognitum you see quite a few that look just like that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 01 48 Roosa: </b> By Jove. We got that, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 02 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Maybe we could have drawn a terminator that was a little more over towards the area where we've shown our target, but there may be quite a drop-off in elevation here. It would only take - quite a bit, to the Sun angle wouldn't have to be an awful lot, on a geologic scale I guess. But the actual terminator was running down just to the west of Le Alda [or M�dler?] so I ran a strip down that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 03 32 Roosa: </b> Okay. We got that. You want to give us the frame number while you got it handy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 03 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Good show. How about 84? [It is not clear which film magazine Ken is referring to here.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 03 45 Roosa: </b> Okay; 84.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 08 54 Roosa: </b> And, Casper; Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 08 59 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 09 02 Roosa: </b> Okay, Ken, as far as tomorrow, you've got a full schedule of the SIM Bay and visuals and landmark tracking and so forth, I'm sure you don't want the details now. Would you be interested in the times of PC-1, lift-off and - </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 09 23 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. Let me get my - let me get my little scratch pad out here and let you give a kind of a summary - of major events anyhow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 09 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 09 52 Roosa: </b> Well, I don't want to - the first part of the day I really don't want to try to get into any details, Ken. It's - it's your standard P20 with a lot of Mapping Camera/Pan Cameras, and all the sensors we got - we got going. You're going to burn plane change 1 at 169 plus 40. That's - that's approximate times. And LM lift-off is approximately 175 plus 50. And I guess [garble] one in the middle there, too. Your - your landmark tracking will come at about 173:20, something in - in that order. And after docking - we're showing you...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 10 44 Mattingly:</b> Hey, that's landmark on the LM?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 10 46 Roosa: </b> That's the landing site landmark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 10 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 10 56 Roosa: </b> And we'd like to have Auto on the High Gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 11 00 Mattingly:</b> Right, you've got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 11 01 Roosa: </b> Okay. And then as I said before after - after docking, at - at this time, we're showing you an hour and 30 minutes for the transfer. And then you'll come inside, have an eat period, and hopefully start the rest period. And your rest period will start at about...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 11 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 11 23 Roosa: </b> ...100 - and start at about 181:30, in that area, will be the rest period.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 11 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And the day starts about 164, was it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 11 35 Roosa: </b> That's affirmative. Around 164.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 11 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's not so bad.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 12 00 Roosa: </b> No. The way you've been swinging along up there doing all that good work, you'll just romp through that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 12 17 Mattingly:</b> Well, I'll tell you, it was - it was kind of nice to just sit back and have that bistatic pass to catch up on all the things you've been putting off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 12 29 Roosa: </b> Yes. I know what you mean.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 12 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and since you reminded me of film, let me give you the - what I got on this DAC magazine too while I take it down. That'll save asking about it later. I have a - a feeling we may be quite a ways behind on our film status. Magazine II has - that'd be 20 - that's looks to me like 42 percent.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 13 10 Roosa: </b> Okay. I copy. II, Item Item, and 42.0 percent.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 13 18 Mattingly:</b> [garble] yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 13 22 Roosa: </b> And I made it your last.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 13 24 Mattingly:</b> That's quite a bit off from the prediction. I wonder if I - I turned it on at the right time, and I turned it off at the right time. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 13 49 Roosa: </b> Oh, I don't know, Ken. That's - that's within 18 percent.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 13 54 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 15 04 Roosa: </b> And, Ken, the word here is that they're not concerned about that percentage, just as long as you photograph the old mass spec.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 15 17 Mattingly:</b> Well, we photographed something that was pointed in that direction.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 15 21 Roosa: </b> The - the bracket didn't break off, did it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 15 23 Mattingly:</b> We took lots of photographs of it, whatever it was. (Laughter) No, I got worried, I knocked it once, and...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 15 33 Roosa: </b> Well, if you dropped it, I'd of worried about the heat shield.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 15 36 Mattingly:</b> It is unbelievable. (Laughter) Well, I started to say I was worried about the spacecraft.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 15 57 Mattingly:</b> Probably get the pictures back and find that it has a natural frequency that's the same as the camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 16 08 Roosa: </b> That's why they made it so big.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 16 12 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) That thing wouldn't even vibrate on a Saturn V.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 16 46 Mattingly:</b> I think the part I liked most about this experiment was Chris Printer's [?] little window shade.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 16 59 Mattingly:</b> It worked just fine, and it couldn't be simpler. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 17 56 Roosa:</b> And, Ken, on your next time around, we're going to want to be talking a little bit about your rendezvous procedure, for tomorrow, and I guess we'll - as we mentioned before, we're recommending using SCS, and we've got some procedures marked up and we can give you as much detail as you want on them as for the switches, so you might want be thinking about that. And any questions about it.
      <p class="tech"><b>154 17 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I think what you told me yesterday sounds like a good plan. I - I don't think that's very difficult to remember. It goes - it's straightforward enough. It goes right along with operating without an IMU except you have the luxury of having all that nice manoeuvre for you.
      <p class="tech"><b>154 18 55 Roosa:</b> Yeah, Ken, it - you know - we talked about a couple of little pitfalls there, you know, of going to CMC control with the SCS - I mean with the Optics switch in Manual and that type thing, and we would like to go through your procedures and stick in a couple of steps that would result, you know, in that wrong procedure. Now, as far as the details on where you put your SCS switches and so forth, I've got a starting plan worked out. I don't know how much detail you want on that - on that sort of thing or just turn you loose and try to do it in SCS.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 19 40 Mattingly:</b> Oh, I'll take all the thoughts that you got, Stu.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 19 43 Roosa: </b> Okay. We'll - we'll probably give you those on your - we will give you those on your next time around so you can cogitate on them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 19 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 20 07 Mattingly:</b> I'd hardly be the Government's hero if I over-torqued my Dukesons [?] on the rendezvous.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 20 17 Roosa: </b> Well, that's - that's the one thing you've always got to watch out for. That and Check 6.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 20 38 Roosa: </b> And, Ken, a reminder on your Waste Stowage Vent valve.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 20 45 Mattingly:</b> Gee, thank you. Is it that time? It sure is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 22 03 Roosa: </b> Ken, have you got any bright planets in your view in that double umbra? Isn't that something - really a beautiful sight, isn't it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>154 22 14 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Hey, you know, I haven't - hadn't gotten around to looking for planets. That's what I was doing the other night when - when things went to worms, and I decided they're probably trying to tell me something. It really is pretty out there, the way you can see all those stars. They - they really stand out. Looks like a planetarium, there's so many.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>154 26 06 Roosa: </b> And, Casper, we're about 2 minutes to LOS, and we'll see you on the other side.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>155 16 32 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) That's right. When you've got nothing, a little goes a long ways.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 16 41 Roosa: </b> Okay. We're about to wind it down, Ken. Only two things I have for you is to go over the rendezvous procedures and I'll let you get on through your pre-sleep checklist and - and wipe it out for the day.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 17 05 Mattingly:</b> Sounds like a good plan. Why don't we go through your - your little plan first?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 17 14 Roosa: </b> Okay. If you're ready, go over to 171:40 and you'll have your pro - procedures there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 17 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay, 100 and let's - 140 - let's see, before I get over there, you want me to - Oh, you'll remind me to come back to the shift the deadband. Okay. Okay, I'm at 171:40.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 17 49 Roosa: </b> Okay. And in that space in between that update and the LM lift-off is a nice place to write. Let's put in there first, "Optics Mode, CMC, verify." Underneath that, let's write a note. "Spacecraft Control must be in SCS prior to Optics Mode, Manual." I'm just reminding you of the note that - that we passed on the other night, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 18 32 Mattingly:</b> That's just fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 18 33 Roosa: </b> Okay. And then come on down after LM lift-off, and where you have P34, delete the "CMC Mode, Hold." And delete the next line, "Set Noun 79," et cetera. Okay, and we'd like to add in here, and it will be four lines, so you might start out kind of small, "Spacecraft Control, SCS; BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 19 32 Roosa: </b> All righty. And then, next line, "Attitude Deadband, Max; Rate, Low; and Limit Cycle, On." That's all on that page.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 19 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let me read that back to you, then. Between the update and lift-off, I've got "Optics Mode to SMC, verify." And the note that "Spacecraft Control must be in SCS prior to Optics Mode going to Manual. Following lift-off, next to the Verb 88, "Spacecraft Control, SCS; BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/ Rate 2; Deadband, Max; Limit Cycle, On; and Rate, Low."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 20 22 Roosa: </b> Okay, that's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 20 40 Roosa: </b> Okay. Go to the next page, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 20 45 Mattingly:</b> All set.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 20 49 Roosa: </b> Okay. Down here at 172:10, delete "CMC Mode Auto."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 21 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 21 02 Roosa: </b> Okay, now, Ken. This is just a couple of words on dealer's choice. Now as you recall from running this in your attitude, right here at about 172:13, your trunion is down through about 22 degrees. And, of course, there you were going Auto. Now they tell me the way you had been flying the SCS rendezvous, that you'd just stay in an Att Hold and let the trunion. If you want to here, you could put the Pitch BMAG to Rate 2 and just bang it once. But I - I'm not gonna give you any - any changes of Flight Plan on that. That's just your option on how you want to keep the trunion angle.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 21 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll write a note here to watch for that, at that point.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 21 47 Roosa: </b> Yeah, your trunion will be - if you're right on nominal - will be 22 degrees right around - oh, somewhere in the order of 172:12 there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 22 08 Roosa: </b> Okay, and then down at the bottom there, prior to - in between the "MSFN disables" and the "P34 final comp," I want you to write in, "Optics Mode, CMC." And this is just a reminder.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 22 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay, between "MSFN disables" and "final comp," we'll write in, "Optics Mode to CMC." I've added the note at the top - at 172:10 - to watch for trunion increasing greater than 22 and BMAG, at least the Pitch one, can go to Rate and give it a blip.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 22 58 Roosa: </b> Okay, that's just - that's just one way of doing it, and it - it works real good and it does not take a large rate in there, just - just about 1 or 2 at the most of what would be a minimum impulse fire.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 23 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay, the only reason I had been using Att Hold before was because we were simulating loss of - of the IMU; and, in that case, I wanted to use the attitude gyros because they had less drift. And it made the marking simpler; but, in this case, I might as well let it - give it a burp and let it track along.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 23 37 Roosa: </b> Okay, that's the way I ran them and the - the line of sight rates are - are pretty low, and it's just sort of one of these no-sweat things. Just about one fast blip and then it - it just hangs right there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 23 55 Mattingly:</b> Very good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 23 56 Roosa: </b> Okay, and you've got your Optics Mode, CMC, down here toward the bottom. We'll turn the page.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 24 05 Mattingly:</b> All right, I'm with you. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 24 10 Roosa: </b> Okay, now, Ken, here's - It - This gets kind of messy through here so you might try to write small. And the only thing we're trying to do is, of course, get into P40 and take the auto maneuver, set up for the SCS burn, get back into track attitude, and then back to SCS. And the way we'll do that is we'll take the first line, "Cycle CMC Mode, Free, Auto," and delete it. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 24 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 24 48 Roosa: </b> Okay. And then, after P40, write "Spacecraft Control, CMC." And next line, "BMAG Mode, parenthesis 3, Rate 2." And I want to make a note there, Ken. I mean this is not for you to write down, unless you want to, but you'll be tracking along here, and you might be a little out of the preferred track attitude. And if you go into Spacecraft Control to CMC before you get to the burn program, the CMC will try to take you back to the preferred attitude, and you're just wasting an RCS maneuver. So wait until after you're in the burn program to go to CMC, and that's - that's true also of P41 for the mid-courses.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 25 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's a good note.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 25 48 Roosa: </b> Okay, and down here where it says "SPS checklist," we're deleting that only because your SPS cue card is - is marked up so bad. And so, the - the reason why - Let's - let's at least say you don't use the cue card as written, which you wouldn't, but we just want to make that point. And in the space in there between "Compare solution in TPI," I've got three lines for you. The first one is, "Spacecraft Control, SCS, after auto manoeuvre." The next line is, and here again this is sort of superfluous, but it's "BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2." And then, just to sum it all up, could we add a note, "Use SCS burn procedures, if required.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 27 07 Roosa: </b> And here again, I'll - this is not for you to write down null - unless you want to, Ken. It's a personal reminder that we talked about before, that, if you Enter on that 204 display before going to SCS, you have activated the - the relay. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 27 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I think I will just put another little note out here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 27 32 Roosa: </b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="ed"><a href="Audio/a16_155_27_46.mp3">Audio File: a16_155_27_46.mp3</a></p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 27 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. If I am in SCS control, though, I can - I can afford to do an Enter on 204?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 27 52 Roosa: </b> That's affirmative. If you're in SCS control, you have no power to that relay. It comes through the Spacecraft Control switch, and it... </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That was my impression.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 03 Roosa: </b> ...and it must be in CMC, so you cannot get the activation of the relay as long as you're in SCS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 15 Roosa: </b> All righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 16 Mattingly:</b> I can still have good navigation through the CMC. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 23 Roosa: </b> That's - that's affirmative. You mean - you mean - you mean the navigation programs?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 36 Mattingly:</b> Onboard state vector, in the event that you did a burn?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 40 Roosa: </b> Oh. What you want to do is - is go on into P40 and stay in P40, and then trim - trim your residuals under - out on the G&amp;N.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 28 56 Mattingly:</b> Roger. That's what I was - that's what I wanted to get at.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 29 00 Roosa: </b> Yeah. And then here's...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 29 01 Mattingly:</b> The only thing I have to do is make the actual burn itself under SCS control.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 29 06 Roosa: </b> What we want you to do is be in SCS control when you respond to that 204 display and make the burn in SCS. And now, here again, I'm going to bring up another little pitfall. You want - down after TPI, you want to wait until the flashing 16 85 comes up before you go back to CMC. Now, you know, TPI is a short burn and you could very well burn in SCS on time and have a 99 flashing up there. Go on, get through that, and get into your flashing 16 85 before you return the - the Spacecraft Control to CMC. At least, by that, is what I'm trying to say, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 29 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 29 57 Roosa: </b> Okay. And that summarizes my next line, it just was "Flashing 16 85," then "Spacecraft Control to CMC" and it was just trying to get across what I just told you in words; and, if you made the burn, why, null your residuals.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 30 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And the - if it's all nominal, there really shouldn't be any manoeuvre there at all for - to attitude for the first midcourse.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 30 44 Roosa: </b> That - that's affirmative. It's - it's generally not. And what - the way the procedures show it, if you want to be technically correct is, prior to P35, reminding you of your BMAGs again - BMAG Mode, 3, to Rate 2. Then go ahead into P35 and - generally, I don't come up with a - with a greater-than-10-degree maneuver, but sometimes it - it dresses up the - the preferred track, there. So...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 31 23 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 31 24 Roosa: </b> Okay. Then after P35, we have "BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2 after manoeuvre."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 31 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 31 50 Roosa: </b> Okay. "Attitude Deadband, Max" is next line. And the next line after that is "Spacecraft Control to SCS." And if you want to write you down a little note beside that "Before Optics Manual."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 32 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 32 35 Roosa: </b> And stand by one - That's okay, Ken. Okay, let's come on down here to P35, and delete "Cycle CMC Mode, Free to Auto."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 32 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 32 59 Roosa: </b> Okay. And let's - Just before that P35 final comp, just because it's an easy place to write it, let's put it down "Optics Mode, CMC."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 33 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Got that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 33 24 Roosa: </b> Okay, then after P41, we'll put "Spacecraft Control, CMC." And now here, Ken, since it's - We never take the manoeuvre, but just to cover all cases on the - on the P41, after "Spacecraft Control, CMC," we can put down "BMAG MODE, 3, Rate 2," since we are running a little out of configuration.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 34 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 34 16 Roosa: </b> Okay. Then, Ken, after - after the Midcourse 1 through P76, P35, and we're just about through with these. We'll have "BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2 after manoeuvre." And the next line is "Spacecraft Control, SCS, before Optics, Manual." And that takes care of that page.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 35 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 35 06 Roosa: </b> All right. If you want to turn the page, we're just about home. Right before the P35 final comp, we'll put "Optics Mode, CMC." And after the P35 final comp, we'll delete the line, "Cycle CMC Mode, Free, Auto." And then after P41, "Spacecraft Control, CMC." And our last entry then, "BMAG Mode, 3, Rate 2." And that was a lot of talking, Ken, but that will keep the BMAGs where they're supposed to be and the relay where it's supposed to be.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 36 20 Mattingly:</b> And it was all worth it. Okay, suppose - suppose I read that all back to you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 36 28 Roosa: </b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 36 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we already covered the...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 36 40 Roosa: </b> Ken, about...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 36 41 Mattingly:</b> And I'll go to Attitude - Yes, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 36 43 Roosa: </b> Okay. Could we interrupt here before your readback, and we've got your jet-on monitor loads but - Stand by one. Yeah, what we'd like for you to do is go to the 2&frac12 degree deadband - there's that change that we had, and then they can be uplinking while you're reading back.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 37 12 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll do that. Just a second here.<br> </p>
      <p class="ed"><a href="Audio/a16_155_37_36.mp3">Audio File: a16_155_37_36.mp3</a></p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 37 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we're in the 2&frac12 degree deadband and you've got Accept.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 37 40 Roosa: </b> Okay, jolly good, and I'm ready for the readback.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 37 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay, let me mark off what I did here. Okay, before lift-off, we'll end up with - making sure that the CMC has control of the optics; we'll fly with the CMC to the initial attitude, then we'll go to SCS Control; BMAGS, 3, Att 1/Rate 2; Max, Deadband; Limit Cycle, On; and Rate, Low. Then we'll do our initial tracking there. And we'll stay with that and 172:10 when the normal auto manoeuvres would be enabled, I - I'll probably take the Pitch BMAG to Rates and start a small rate in there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 38 45 Roosa: </b> Yeah, that'll be just one small blip.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 38 51 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 39 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and just before the final comp on P34, we put the Optics Mode to CMC. Let the P34 finish and once I'm in P40, I give the Spacecraft Control to CMC; BMAGs, 3, to Rate 2; and accept the manoeuvre. When I'm in Attitude, I can go back and do SCS control; BMAGs, 3, Att 1/Rate 2; and, should a burn be required, I'll make an SCS auto burn. I'll null the G&amp;N residuals, still remaining in SCS control. I'll proceed past the Noun 85 before returning control to G&amp;N. And it'll be BMAGs, three, to RATE 2 when I get - I think the safest place is when I get in - all the way into P35. When I get it - there, I'll return Spacecraft Control to CMC and take the manoeuvre. Go back to SCS control; BMAGs, Att 1/Rate 2, all 3. Deadband, Max; then I'll take Spacecraft Control, SCS; and then Optics to Manual. Prior to the final comp, we go Optics Mode to CMC. Again, at P41, we'll hold Spacecraft Control to CMC, and I'll be bypassing the manoeuvre. And I - But if we - if we take the manoeuvre, it's BMAGs, 3 to Rate 2. Again, we'll proceed all the way through it; and, when I get into P35, I'll take the BMAGs back to Att 1/Rate 2; and give Spacecraft Control to SCS. Then, Optics to Manual. Same procedure for Midcourse 2, except that at the completion of Midcourse 2, why, I'll just stay in SCS - I mean, CMC.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 41 23 Roosa: </b> Okay, Ken. Couple of comments there, now. I guess how you trim the residuals is sort of dealer's choice. Once you're in that flashing 16 85 display, why, you can go to CMC freely. So you can play that any way you want.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 41 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, but I might just as well stay in SCS. That's a simpler - and one less number that I'm likely to confuse.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 41 55 Roosa: </b> Okay, now let me - and your - your readback was - was okay. There is something now that I'll say - after the P35 where you have BMAG Mode, 3, Att 1/Rate 2; okay, if the - the CMC will start you on a good track rate; I just didn't want to get the procedures too clowned up; but, you know if you put your Pitch BMAG to Rate 2 there, before you go to SCS, you'll keep in your CMC track. Now you'll be below the rate at which you're maneuvreing, but you - between TPI and Midcourse 1, you'll exceed your - your attitude deadband. So, since you did say you were going to go - to go on the track method, people talked me out of when they said you always did the other one, but I think you should put a note in there, BMAG Roll and Yaw, Att 1/Rate 2, and Pitch BMAG to - I mean Roll and Yaw, Att 1/Rate 2 and leave your Pitch in Rate 2. Did all that talking make sense? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 43 12 Mattingly:</b>Okay. That sounds like a good plan. Yes, sir; I understand you.
      <p class="tech"><b>155 43 17 Roosa:</b>Okay. And that would also be true after the other P35.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 43 28 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 43 42 Roosa: </b> And just so we make sure that all procedures showing the same - I'm - I'm changing mine to show that, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 43 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I have mine changed, too.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 44 12 Roosa: </b> Okay. And I think that's it. I thought before the rendezvous, we'd - we'd give you a swinging Delta tail off just for your weight even though you've got a chart. Just so you wouldn't have to do any figuring out. Of course, 11 is always a good number, but, just to be professional, we'll give you a good one - and since you are making an SCS burn.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 44 42 Mattingly:</b> Thank you. I was going to ask you for that. It's really not quite the same as if you had SCS only because you got the information there what's the right thing; but it sure helped to - be a lot cheaper about your RCS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 44 57 Roosa: </b> Roger. We might as well be professional about this whole show, since you're doing such a good job up there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 45 12 Mattingly:</b> Hey, there's one other thing I was going to ask you. Yeah. About the Mapping Camera. Are we going to leave it out or we going to try and retract it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 45 22 Roosa: </b> Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 45 40 Roosa: </b> Ken, the SIM Bay is configured for sleep. As of right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 45 48 Mattingly:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, I - I'm - I'm still thinking about rendezvous.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 45 56 Roosa: </b> Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 46 15 Roosa: </b> Okay, Ken, we're going to retract the camera for rendezvous, extend it again, and then we'll retract it for TEI.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 46 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess since we're a little down on the RCS that might be a prudent plan. Looks like we're holding our own, if it hadn't been for that practice in formation flying.</p>
      <p class="ed"><a href="Audio/a16_155_46_55.mp3">Audio File: a16_155_46_55.mp3</a></p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 46 55 Roosa: </b> Ken, as far as the Flight Plan now - the - the new revised version, we're 15 pounds ahead of the - of the Flight Plan. And we're fat on the - on the rescue redline.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 47 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That sounds a little bit like changing the specs.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 47 22 Roosa: </b> (Laughter) Well, you got to - you got to be fast on your feet. And we're 168 (pounds) above the rescue redline.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 47 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I will continue to be miserly.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 47 36 Roosa: </b> By all means, and we are minus 139 on the other Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 47 47 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 47 52 Roosa: </b> Okay. And I guess that takes care of our - of our rendezvous procedures. And sounds like you got them all copied in good order and I feel certain that'll go real easy for you. That's a - that's a smooth procedure even though it takes a lot of talking. And I guess I might remind you about your Waste Storage Vent valve at this time - if you haven't already got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 48 20 Mattingly:</b> I've already turned it Off, Stuart.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>155 48 22 Roosa: </b> Okay. I thought maybe if I talked to you long enough you might - you might miss that; but I didn't catch you.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, 157:12 minutes [157:00] into the mission of Apollo 16. All three crewmen aboard both Casper and Orion [are] tucked in for the night, on what should be about 8 hours sleep period on both spacecraft, for both sets of crews. Ken Mattingly signed off during the 42nd lunar rev and he and Casper are some ten minutes away from Acquisition of Signal coming around on lunar orbit number 43. [The] Gold Team of Flight Controllers came on at midnight Central Time here at [the] Control Center, and are fine tuning the flight plan items; sorting out systems status and so on for the Lunar Module, for the EVA 3 to take place today at 157:14 [157:02] this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="ed">[Lunar Rev 43 starts at 157:03.]</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, [at] 158 hours and 12 minutes [158:00] Ground Elapsed Time. Command Service Module Casper [is] more than midway across the front - face of the Moon in revolution number 43, 23 minutes away from Loss of Signal. Meanwhile, Young and Duke are still asleep at Descartes Landing Site. The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package that has been erected at Descartes Landing Site by Young and Duke continues to operate normally at this time. 149 commands have been uplinked to the station scientific station. The input power from the thermoelectric generator is steady at 70.4 Watts. The Passive Seismic Experiment and the Lunar Surface Magnetometer Experiment are both downlinking scientific data, and all of their subsystems are performing satisfactorily. All of the thermal characteristics of the ALSEP equipment are nominal and are following the predicted temperature values. The central station of the ALSEP is showing thermal plate temperatures rising at the expected rate of 4 degrees Fahrenheit per hour. At 158:15 [158:03] Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 159 hours 12 minutes [159:00] Ground Elapsed Time. About 4 hours remaining in the sleep period for Duke and Young aboard ORION, in as much as they'll probably sleep about 30 minutes past the normal wake up time - the pre planned wakeup time. Casper meanwhile, the Command Service Module is in a 56.2 by 63.5 nautical mile lunar orbit coming up on the front side pass for Rev 44 in about 9 minutes. Gold Team, flight control team here in Mission Control [are] watching a playback of the video tape [of] EVA number 2. At any rate those members of the team who were not involved in planning the day�s activities. That's one way to stay awake. At 159 14 [159:02] this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="ed">[Lunar Rev 44 starts at 159 01.] </p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 160 hours 12 minutes [160:00] Ground Elapsed Time into the Mission of Apollo 16. Command Service Module, Casper, [is] nearing the end of the 44th revolution on side pass. Two and a half hours showing in the sleep period clock for Duke and Young aboard Orion. However, likely [that it] will run closer to 3 hours before the crews is waked [sic] up. Twenty-one minutes to Command Service Module LOS [on] Rev 44. [A] Rather quiet night here in Mission Control. Some of the console positions doing a little homework study for the day's activities, straightening out the accumulation of paperwork, still running the video tape playback of EVA 2, and at 160:14 [160:02] , this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="ed">[Lunar Rev 45 starts at 161 00.]</p> <a name="162_00"></a>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 162 hours 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. About 37 minutes showing on the wakeup clock until the crew of Orion is called for the start of their final days activity at Descartes landing site. Briefly summarized the EVA 3 activities will begin with some 45 minutes after depressurization being spent in the immediate area of the Lunar Module. Getting the LRV loaded with all the gear for the geological sampling. Getting everything prepared for the trek out to North Ray Crater. The arrival at North Ray Crater at what's called Stations 11 and 12 will be at 1 hour and 25 minutes after start of EVA. Total distance out to this particular point 4.9 kilometers. At 2 hours 30 minutes into EVA 3 they will return back some &frac12 kilometer, that is south from North Ray Crater to Station 13, arriving there some 4 minutes later. They will spend 20 minutes at Station 13 collecting documented samples and rake soil samples. Young and Duke will leave Station 13 at 4 hours and 5 minutes into EVA, return to what is called the 10 prime area, that is at Station 10 from EVA 2, going back again for a second look, therefore, it is called 10 prime. They will arrive at this location at 3 hours 31 minutes into EVA. Then they will return to the immediate area of the Lunar Module Orion at 4 hours and 5 minutes into the EVA and spend the remaining 55 minutes of the 5 hour EVA 3 in closeout. Parking - parking of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, stowing all the film gear for transfer into the Orion, all the sample bags, doing all the general housekeeping, grounds-keeping that has to be done prior to closing out the final EVA. The total distance estimated for the EVA 3, that is LRV mileage or kilometrage, will be 9.85 kilometers. Command module Casper [is] nearing the end of its 45 - 45th lunar orbit some 17 minutes away from Loss of Signal. At 162 16 [162:04], this is Apollo Control.</p>
