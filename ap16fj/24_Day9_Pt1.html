				<p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> Apollo Control Houston. 189 hours, 29 minutes [189:17] Ground Elapsed Time. We're standing by now for a wakeup call to the crew of Apollo 16.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 18 14 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 18 51 Mattingly:</b> Hello there.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 18 52 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 18 59 Mattingly:</b> Already?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 19 03 Hartsfield:</b> Were you still snoozing?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 19 08 Mattingly:</b> You betcha.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 19 16 Hartsfield:</b> How's your writing arm this morning?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 19 23 Mattingly:</b> Now, now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 19 33 Young:</b> Wait until he gets the sleep out of his eyes.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 19 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The first thing I want to do, Hank, is to check on the lithium canister. I got - I had some trouble getting that one out of - out of B last night; and let me go down and check that other one before I do anything else and make sure I don't get it stuck. These things are swelling a little bit now, and they've been a little - a little difficult to get to.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 20 01 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
				<p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> That's Ken Mattingly aboard Apollo 16 talking to Capcom Hank Hartsfield here in Mission Control.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 20 40 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. Charlie's going off biomed here for a while.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 20 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 21 17 Young:</b> Ken really had a hard time getting that LiOH canister out last night. He had to wiggle it back and forth about 20 times and go - and come forward and then he'd push it back, come forward, and push it back. Finally got it worked out of there. But what he was worried about and what - what worried me is, is there a possibility of busting that nylon strap on there off? In which case you'd probably never get it out.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 21 50 Hartsfield:</b> I don't know, John. I'll question them on that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 21 56 Young:</b> Okay. I think I remember breaking off one sometime a long time ago, and I just wondered if they'd beefed that thing up any.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 22 25 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Is the A side free?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 22 35 Mattingly:</b> I just checked them, Hank. They're - they're both okay, now. I had a little trouble getting the one out - let's see, which one was it last night? It was the - it was the B, and I had just a little trouble getting the one out yesterday morning, or whenever it was we made the other change of A. But it was just a little sticky; it wasn't like this. I think we may have had a little extra humidity because the windows are starting to fog up more often now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 23 06 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 23 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I killed the jet monitor, and I - I am ready to copy.</p><a name="189_23"></a>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 23 52 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. The first change occurs at 189:46 in the Flight Plan.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 24 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 24 09 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 189:46 [189:35], add "Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On," and you might make a note there to perform this before opening the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter cover. What we're going to do here is to turn the camera on before we open the door and use the Gamma-Ray Boom as a reference. They want to try to get an idea of what's happening on this extend/retract on the Mapping Camera; and, later on, we'll do the same thing. We'll turn the camera on and retract it all the way with it running and close the door before we turn it off.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 24 54 Mattingly:</b> Aren't you guys clever? Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 24 59 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 189:51 [189:40], delete "Image Motion, On; and delete Mapping Camera, On, T-start." Change the "Image Motion, Incr ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 25 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'd better get my maneuver going here before we do anything, else.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 25 21 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Press on with that, and let me know when you're ready to go again.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 25 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Would you check my Logic Power, on, on 181, please?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 25 43 Hartsfield:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 25 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I didn't think I got to them last night to turn them off.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 00 Duke:</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 02 Mattingly:</b> There's two guarded switches down there.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 05 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, are you on Vox this morning?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 06 Mattingly:</b> On the bottom row. Yeah.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 11 Duke:</b> Yes, sir. Thank you.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. While I'm getting this roll going, why don't you give me some more of that stuff? The last thing I copied was the deletion at 189:50 [189:38] of the Image Motion and the Mapping Camera, On.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 41 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. And the "Image Motion, Increase", change the "Barber pole" to "Barber pole plus one."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's BP plus one.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 26 53 Hartsfield:</b> And at 189:57 [189:45], "Charge Battery A."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Charge Battery A at 189: 57 [189:45].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 13 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. On the next page, at 190:15 [190:03], P52 ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 19 Mattingly:</b> Before I leave that, Hank, do you have a camera stop time?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 31 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by one.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 47 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, would you give us Accept, please?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 52 Mattingly:</b> You have it.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 55 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We're going to send you a new state vector; and FAO advises that stop time will be read up with the updates.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 28 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 28 17 Hartsfield:</b> I think - you - you got your roll attitude now?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 28 23 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. Let me get that straightened out first.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 29 32 Mattingly:</b> That's good.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 29 42 Mattingly:</b> Hank, there's no way we're going to make it to this attitude on time.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 29 48 Hartsfield:</b> it's not critical, Ken.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 29 50 Mattingly:</b> I guess that's agreeable with everybody. Okay. But I assume that - we might just as well hold off on this camera extension and all that until daylight. It looks like it's going to be dark or do you want to do that right now while we're ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 30 37 Hartsfield:</b> We want to - we want to do it now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 30 09 Mattingly:</b> Do that, and get this attitude, and take whatever lighting happens to be out there? Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 30 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay, let me - it'll work. No, it's still daylight. Make sure. it should be. Yeah. Okay. Get [vox] this dirty?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 30 51 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, you got it all dirty.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 31 01 Mattingly:</b> IMC is On; it's barber pole and - gray. The Mapping Camera is coming On -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 31 13 Mattingly:</b> Mark. The Laser Altimeter door is coming open -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 21 21 Mattingly:</b> Mark it. Barber pole, gray. Mapping Camera is going to Extend -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 31 40 Mattingly:</b> Mark. It's barber pole and running. While I'm here, I'll get the Gamma Ray Shield, Off, and the Laser Altimeter, On.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 32 09 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Image Motion is set, and ready to copy some - some more.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 32 16 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, at 190:15 [190:03]. Next page. P52, option 3 -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 32 25 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 32 27 Hartsfield:</b> ... followed by GDC align.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 32 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 32 40 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The next thing occurs at 191 hours. I guess you can get it right at the top of that page, "CMP, open LM hatch."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 32 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 33 00 Hartsfield:</b> At 191:05 [190:53], may have to use an arrow to get it in there, "Image Motion, Increase, Barber Pole, On."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 33 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay. IMC to barber pole at 191:05.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 33 22 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And for planning, about 191:06 [190:54], we plan to start reading up the LM changes if we can get through these. At 191:16 [191:04], from that MSFN up-link black, delete the LOPC target-load information there in the desired orient.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 33 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's deleted.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 33 52 Hartsfield:</b> At 191:16 [191:04], you'll have to use an arrow again ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 33 55 Mattingly:</b> For planning purposes, what book should the LM guys have available to write in?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 00 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The LM Contingency Checklist and the LM Timeline.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We'll have those out.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 12 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. 191:16 [191:04], we want the "Image Motion to ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 17 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 18 Hartsfield:</b> ... barber pole plus four."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay, BP plus four at 191:16 [191:04].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 28 Hartsfield:</b> And delete the update block at 191:18 [191:06].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 38 Hartsfield:</b> High Gain to Auto.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 50 Mattingly:</b> You've got it.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 34 53 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, and I'll - stand corrected on that update block. We'll give you a TEI pad there.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 35 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 35 06 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 191:33 [191:21], delete everything down to orbital science photos.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 35 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, that one I can do.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 35 26 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. And at 191:50 [191:38], here's where we're going to close that mapping camera up; I guess the best thing to do is just scratch through all that stuff there and write out to the side the order we want to get it in, which is as follows: "Laser Altimeter, Off; Mapping Camera, Retract; Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Closed - that's after it's retracted, of course - "Mapping Camera, Off." And I think you're at attitude now, Ken, if you want to start your P20. It's not at attitude, stand corrected.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 36 17 Mattingly:</b> Thank you, sir.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 36 20 Hartsfield:</b> Yeah, it must have bumped a stick there.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 36 26 Mattingly:</b> [Vox] Thank you. I'm glad somebody is awake this morning.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 36 46 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. After the Mapping Camera Off, wait 22 seconds, Mapping Camera, Standby; IMC Off" They want to do a Verb 49 to the LM comm, deep space measurement attitude to arrive at 192:10 [191:58]. The attitude is 322, 115, 305. High-Gain angles for AOS acq: Pitch, minus 35; Yaw 235. And along about 213:00, beg - Stand corrected - 191:55 [191:43], want to start transferring equipment from the LM.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 38 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now, give me that time that you've got to be in attitude again, I didn't get that one.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 38 17 Hartsfield:</b> One - 192:10 [191:58].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 38 29 Mattingly:</b> 192:10. Okay. And you didn't say anything about the X-Ray. Do you want it to go to Standby?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 38 43 Hartsfield:</b> We want to leave the X-Ray, On.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 38 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay. So all the rest of that block up there, I delete, right?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 38 52 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 38 55 Mattingly:</b> And leave the alpha-particle cover open and all that. Okay. I'll just delete all those guys, and let me read you what I have. That's the "Laser Altimeter - Starting at 191:50 [191:38] we'll go "Laser Altimeter, Off; Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter when it's in, the "Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover" is to "Close," the Mapping Camera" then comes "Off" and we go through a little ditty of "33 seconds, Standby; IMC, Off." While we're doing this, we can do a Verb 49 to the attitude 322, 115, 305; AOS High Gain angles will be Pitch, minus 35; Yaw, 235. I need to be in attitude by 192:10 [191:58]. Starting about 191:55 [191:43], you want to start transfer of LM equipment.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 39 50 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. Now, if you'll make a little note there, go to 214 hours, Page 323.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 40 07 Mattingly:</b> Go to - Say again?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 40 10 Hartsfield:</b> 214 hours, that's on three hundred and - Page 323.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 40 21 Mattingly:</b> Ah-hah.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 40 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 40 36 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I'm going to give you both times. If you like, you can write in the - your clock times over these. 214 hours becomes 192:10 [191:58] -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 40 46 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Hank - Hank, I'm getting - I'm getting confused. Would you give an overall picture, so that I can have some - some perspective of what we're doing. It - it'd sure made it a lot easier. I can copy this line by line, but I'll never - never keep it all straight here if -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 41 02 Hartsfield:</b> Okay We're gonna do the items in the Flight Plan up to 192:00 [191:48], and then we're gonna go over to 214 hours in the Flight Plan and pick up these items in there - until we get over to about 216:15. And then we're gonna jump back to 176:55, and pick up the LM jett procedure. And when we get through with that, we're gonna jump back to...</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>189 41 43 Mattingly:</b> ... Wait a minute - wait. Let me absorb what you're saying. Okay, Hank. When you say you're gonna pick up, these things over here at Rev 72, I guess you're looking at all these visual targets and photo targets.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 42 08 Hartsfield:</b> Actually, we're scrubbing most that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 10 Mattingly:</b> And of those - Oh, okay. All right, I was gonna say because we're in - we're on a groundtrack that isn't very compatible with some of those things. Okay, so then you're gonna do that and then you're gonna go back and do the LM jettison, and then come back up to the subsat?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And we're trying to work at a ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 31 Mattingly:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 33 Hartsfield:</b> ...clock update in here somewhere to get all this to look right.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 37 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Okay ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 40 Young:</b> That'll be the trick of the year.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 42 Mattingly:</b> Can you do that with a clock sync? You're even better than I thought you were.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 46 Hartsfield:</b> Nobody down here ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 47 Mattingly:</b> All right, let me ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 48 Hartsfield:</b> ... even knows what time it is now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 42 50 Mattingly:</b> ... change the - the - Don't tell us things like that. Let me - all right, let me - let's - so we can make sure we're all talking in the same hours, I would like to do like we did the other day and - and correct the - the - times in the Flight Plan that are printed now to be the times that we'll really do it. And then you talk to me in times that we'll really do it and forget what it says in the Flight Plan.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 22 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I'll do that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 24 Mattingly:</b> That worked out real good with the rendezvous. Okay, so now the pages I need to fix the times on are going to be - starting at Page 323.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 34 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative, and 214:00 becomes ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 37 Mattingly:</b> And 214 hours will be ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 39 Hartsfield:</b> 192:10 [191:58].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 43 Mattingly:</b> 19 - uh-oh. 192:10?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 47 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. You have to subtract 21 hours and 50 minutes from these times.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 43 53 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Sim Sup [Simulator Supervisor - ie this is like a simulation] is having a field day. Okay. This will take me a few minutes, but I'll - I'll get there.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 44 09 Hartsfield:</b> I'm considering resigning after this shift.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 44 15 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Okay. Just a second, Hank, let me - I'll - I'll get this page done, and then we can work on it, and I'll be right with you.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 44 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. let's see.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 44 56 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, can we get a Shield, On, Gamma Ray?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 01 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. Try 9-A.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 08 Duke:</b> It's on, Ken.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 09 Mattingly:</b> Thank you. It's on, Hank.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 25 Hartsfield:</b> You're at attitude now, Ken.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 31 Mattingly:</b> Thank you.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 50 Mattingly:</b> Hang on a second.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 45 52 Duke:</b> Just a minute, Ken.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 55 Mattingly:</b> How about L-3</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 45 56 Duke:</b> L-3</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 46 00 Hartsfield:</b> Say again, Ken.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 46 06 Mattingly:</b> I'm sorry. We got - we got a lot of things going on at one time here. Okay. I've got Page 323 times corrected now, if you want to - if you want to correct those - those events before I work on the next page?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 46 26 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 192:10 [191:58], delete the galactic photo sequence.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 46 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 46 42 Hartsfield:</b> In fact, delete everything in that page, and then, at 192:23, LM activation begins. Actually, everything in the left hand column, I should have said, should be deleted.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. LM activation goes where all that other stuff is.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 14 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 23 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead, Hank.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 25 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The next column, all the P20 stuff; and at "Acquire MSFN," the High Gain</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now, what about this Skylab contamination at the bottom of the page?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 37 Hartsfield:</b> Delete.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 47 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Start over again now in the next column.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 27 51 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Delete the P20. The MSFN angles are minus 35, yaw, 238.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 48 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 48 09 Hartsfield:</b> Delete the orbital science prep - the configure camera, et cetera, and the orbital science. At 192:55 [191:43] there, we're going to up-link to the LM - just for your information - a state vector liftoff time P23 - P30 load and P99.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 48 40 Mattingly:</b> I hope that's not a lift-off time.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 48 44 Hartsfield:</b> Negative.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 49 00 Hartsfield:</b> The computer is yours.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 49 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 49 07 Hartsfield:</b> At 193:04 [192:52], we're gonna give you the LM jettison pad.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 49 24 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And where will that go? We're gonna go back to the other - the other part of the book?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 49 32 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. You'll copy that at - on Page 283. That's at 176:15 in the original Flight Plan.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 49 22 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter).</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 50 02 Mattingly:</b> If you pull it out, I think, you'll probably find more behind it there. Okay, Hank.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 50 14 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. On the next page, we need to change all those times again. 215 becomes 193:10 [192:58].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 50 42 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. Let me see what time that was.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 50 44 Duke:</b> It's just 10 minutes.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 50 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we're - oh - let me - which battery?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 51 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We're charging battery A.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 51 05 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 51 09 Mattingly:</b> There.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 51 50 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead, Hank.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 51 52 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At - at 193:10 [192:58], Verb 49 manouver to LM jett pad attitude.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 52 24 Hartsfield:</b> Delete the shape target load there in the MSFN up-link</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 52 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 52 42 Hartsfield:</b> Delete the target - the orbital science stuff there - delete the rest of the things in that column and at 193:23, begin suit donning.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 53 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay, And we're all waiting with bated breath to find out what time you <u>end</u> suit donning.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 53 30 Mattingly:</b> 206:25 [206:13].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 53 35 Hartsfield:</b> I guess just when the end is end. I - Let's - let's look here at the next column; 193:40. Delete ... </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 53 41 Crew: </b> (Laughter) [Garble] discouraging.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 53 42 Hartsfield:</b> Delete down through "Mapping Camera Laser Altimeter Cover, Close."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 54 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Are you - are you sure we wouldn't do better starting with a clean page like we did the other day once.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 54 11 Hartsfield:</b> I've been thinking the same thing.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 54 13 Mattingly:</b> I didn't mean to be facetious about that, Hank - because it seems like I'm doing more deleting than I'm writing, and it's getting so that - it's getting so confused, I may miss writing down - You know, when it comes time to execute, I may miss something.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 54 39 Hartsfield:</b> Well, if we had it to do over, I think this is what we ought to do. This thing was just handed to me a few minutes ago, and we're trying to straighten it out. You want to continue with this, or do you want to try to salvage...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 54 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, let's - yes, sir. Let's press on. Let's press on to this sequence until we get to LM jett, and see how it works.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 55 00 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At - at 193:46 [193:34], and I guess you're just going to have to write this in the left-hand column and point over there because that's what I had to do. We want "Mass Spec, Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiment to Standby." </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 55 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. Hank, let me - let me regroup now. I got everything deleted out of all that stuff that's on there down through "Mapping Camera Cover, Close." That leaves the alpha cover to be closed. Is that correct?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 55 41 Hartsfield:</b> That's correct.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 55 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now read me the write-in.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 56 02 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. It's "Mass Spec, Ion Source, Off."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 56 10 Mattingly:</b> At what time?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 56 11 Hartsfield:</b> 193:46 [193:34]. "Experiment to Standby." And then there's a little caution, wait 5 minutes before retracting Mass Spec boom. "Gamma Ray, Retract; X-Ray to Standby; and then at 193:51 [193:39], which is your five minutes, Mass Spec, Retract."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 57 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. So I've deleted all that stuff that's there, except for the Alpha cover Close. At 193:46 [193:34], we'll take the Mass Spec Ion Source, Off, and Experiment to Standby. Start our five-minute time. The Gamma Ray boom gets retracted, the X-Ray goes to Standby, and after 5 minutes, I retract the mass spec boom, and the alpha-particle cover will come closed.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 57 27 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And then you'll do the - you'll do the purge line Heaters, On, configure for the dump, and the rest of the things there.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 57 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 57 40 Hartsfield:</b> And on the next page, at 194:10 [193:58] - </p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 57 40 Young (onboard):</b> Charlie, I - I have no remembrance ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 57 40 Hartsfield:</b> And on the next page, at 194:10 [193:58] - </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 57 45 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Hank - Okay. This - This PGA donning, with things going on during it, bothers me a little bit. We - this PGA donning in our present configuration is - is a three-man effort, even if one man's job is to get in the corner and stay there - stay out of the way; and I'd like for us to do the minimum activity while we're putting those suits on.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 58 26 Mattingly:</b> If we can do it in the LM, I guess that will relieve a lot of the load here.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 58 33 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I guess we're just gonna have to do the best we can, Ken, and we'll try to help as much as we can from down here.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 58 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It's not so much a problem entirely, it's just keeping track of things, and you just - once a guy starts putting that suit on, he commands the rest of the volume in the spacecraft. It's a - that A7LB is a real - real interesting operation. </p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 58 17 Young (onboard):</b> Unless we could go over in the LM and do it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 58 19 Duke (onboard):</b> We can do it in the LM. That might be best [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 58 24 Young (onboard):</b> Ask them if we can do it ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 58 25 Mattingly:</b> If we can use the LM or it, that will help out a great deal. [According to the CM transcript "If we can do it in the LM, I guess that'll relieve a lot of the load here".]</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 58 32 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We'll plan to do that.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 59 17 Young (onboard):</b> Now, we gonna have the LM - do we have the LM closed out?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 19 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 194:10 [193:58], delete the P52 and ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 59 22 Duke (onboard):</b> It'll...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 23 Hartsfield:</b> ... the "P20; CMC Mode, Auto; GDC align."</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>189 59 25 Duke (onboard):</b> It'll be - Oh, excuse me. It'll be closed out, and all you have to do is close the hatch.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 30 Hartsfield:</b> Do the purges and dumps, delete the P30 remark there...</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>189 59 33 Young (onboard):</b> Want some scrambled eggs, hot?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 40 Hartsfield:</b> ... and, at 194:23 [193:11], we're going to close the hatches.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 43 Mattingly:</b> Wait a minute. Did you say delete the dumps?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 46 Hartsfield:</b> Negative. Do the dumps.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>189 59 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Do the dumps and the purge, delete the P52, and the alignment and the P30 stuff.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 00 01 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And, at 194 ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 00 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay, now. Let me write the times on this page.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 00 10 Young (onboard):</b> Shh! Look at that!</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 00 31 Duke (onboard):</b> That's [garble].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 00 31 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 194:23 [194:11], we've closed the hatches, and you do the "Purge Line Heaters, Off," and terminate the waste water dump; and, at this point ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 00 47 Duke (onboard):</b> Terminate waste water dump, I think is what -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 00 49 Hartsfield: </b> ... we're going to jump in the Flight Plan. I think that's as far as we ought to go on this rev. We're about two minutes from LOS ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 00 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You're starting to break up.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 00 55 Hartsfield: </b> ... but, at this point, you're going to jump back to 176: 55.</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>190 01 06 Mattingly:</b> If you'll tell me time bias to put on that page, I'll have that ready.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 01 17 Hartsfield:</b> We'll catch that the next rev, Ken.</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>190 01 31 Hartsfield:</b> We weren't planning on doing that section. We were just going to do all those steps. There's about 45 minutes of stuff in there getting ready for the jett before we do it.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 04 Young (onboard):</b> You want me to do it? [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 07 Duke (onboard):</b> Are you supposed to?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 10 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You said that before, but it's ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 14 Young (onboard):</b> Right now?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 15 Mattingly (onboard):</b> ... it's going to ridiculous now.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 16 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 17 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 23 Young (onboard):</b> If they weren't stowed, I couldn't even do what I'm doing. Where do these things here live?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 28 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay; well, since - I think the next thing to do is to put them right back on, so why don't you just hand them to me?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 33 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I sure don't want to get a lot of crud in there.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 38 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, now I need no special techniques to do this.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 41 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You don't even need the telescope.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 45 Duke (onboard):</b> John, when you get around to it ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 46 Young (onboard):</b> He's not even using - I better not - not even use it. When I get around to what, Charlie?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 52 Duke (onboard):</b> When you get around to it, I'll eat your grits. If you don't want them.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 56 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 05 57 Duke (onboard):</b> Or Ken's.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 00 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Or both.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 05 Young (onboard):</b> You all set, Ken?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 07 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay; you've got to turn the optics power on.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 10 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, [garble] something like [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 14 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, now take the Optics out of Zero and back to Zero.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 19 Young (onboard):</b> What's that switch there do? </p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 21 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That - that's your manual switch. And if you ain't in SCS, don't touch it, which you are in SCS now.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 30 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 32 Duke (onboard):</b> SCS ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 3B Young (onboard):</b> [garble] P52?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 35 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yep. </p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 38 Duke (onboard):</b> Does it keep the orb rate going?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 39 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, but I've got a rate that - it's not gonna change much.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 46 Young (onboard):</b> My gosh.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 50 Duke (onboard):</b> Man, it's delicious.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 06 52 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, Star 21.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 07 12 Young (onboard):</b> Right in there. That's a super platform, I'll tell you.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 07 20 Duke (onboard):</b> We had our's powered down completely for 2 days. When we brought it back up, the torquing angles were something like - well, in coarse align, it doesn't - we put it - we parked it in gimbal lock. We didn't have any gyro drift updates or any PIPA bias. That procedure really worked, John.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 07 43 Young (onboard):</b> Sure did.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 07 44 Duke (onboard):</b> Parking that beauty over there. And my [garble] was right on the time.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 07 52 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh, darn. What star - that was -</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 07 54 Duke (onboard):</b> Thirty.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 07 55 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Thirty. Okay. And the other star was 25?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 01 Duke (onboard):</b> Twenty-one, you ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 02 Young (onboard):</b> Twenty-one.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 03 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's what I thought, but I just saw a - oh, that was the code. Oh, oh [garble] that 25 I saw [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 13 Young (onboard):</b> Be easier - [garble] tweak optics? Well, I'll set it back because I can't do it [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 31 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 37 Young (onboard):</b> That [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 41 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's one of the biggest gyro [garble] I've had.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 43 Young (onboard):</b> Well, don't forget [garble] new man on today.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 51 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay. Okay; why don't you torque it, and tell me when you do?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 58 Young (onboard):</b> Tell you?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 08 59 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 02 Young (onboard):</b> That'll be 190:20:55 [190:09:05].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 06 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 09 Young (onboard):</b> Mark. Oh, I should have Pro[ceed]ed. That'll be 190:21.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 13 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter)</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 23 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 24 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay; put it to ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 26 Young (onboard):</b> Trunnion is back to normal. I'm going to CMC and Zero. I've had ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 30 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You got the trunnion back to - close to zero.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 32 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> All right.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 34 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble] zero.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 35 Mattingly (onboard):</b> And the CM - the mode switch is in CMC.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 38 Young (onboard):</b> Mode switch is going to CMC.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 41 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 45 Young (onboard):</b> That shaft couldn't [garble] trunnion, though.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 49 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Hasn't gotten any worse.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 53 Young (onboard):</b> Now, I - I Pro out of here, right? Or Enter out of here. Pro?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 09 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Enter.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 00 Young (onboard):</b> What do you want?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 01 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Twenty.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 06 Young (onboard):</b> Okay; you're back and running.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 10 Duke (onboard):</b> John, why don't you come let me mix? I've eaten my two things.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 15 Young (onboard):</b> Let me mix a few more, Charlie.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 17 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay, I've [garble] ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 18 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, we've got a lithium change. Oh, forget it. We don't do it. We can - we can do it right after we eat, if you help me remember it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 35 Duke (onboard):</b> Wednesday, I think I might shave.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That won't - it won't hack it, Charlie.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 40 Duke (onboard):</b> It won't work? The thing [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 43 Mattingly (onboard):</b> It will on a beard like that.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 44 Duke (onboard):</b> Oh. What do you mean?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 48 Mattingly (onboard):</b> It just sits there and whirs.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 50 Duke (onboard):</b> Oh. It doesn't cut at all?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 53 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I couldn't tell I made a dent.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 55 Duke (onboard):</b> On your beard like that?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 56 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 10 58 Young (onboard):</b> Charlie, you look like that, too. I hate to tell you.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 01 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, I wish you wouldn't cast any stones there, old buddy. (Laughter)</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 04 Duke (onboard):</b> Well, I know it. I know it. I know it. I feel like it. That thing won't cut, huh?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 11 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I think if we cleaned it out and all, it probably would made a big difference, but -</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 14 Duke (onboard):</b> I - that'll be my project for the - for after the EVA.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 20 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter) We'll be copying Flight Plan updates right through EI.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 30 Young (onboard):</b> That water doesn't have any bubbles in it!</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, if you go slow, it doesn't. Okay, did you put the optics back up?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 38 Young (onboard):</b> No. Excuse me.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 50 Young (onboard):</b> 184.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 11 52 Mattingly (onboard):</b> There you go. Charlie, let's see - how about setting Pitch 10 and Yaw zero on the High Gain, and Man - yeah. And Manual and Wide.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 12 51 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay; here's the covers.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 12 55 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble] any target we pick out?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 02 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, we had a burn yesterday.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 04 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 26 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Now, I wonder if I can get down there and get to my bag.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 31 Young (onboard):</b> Your urine bag?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 32 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 33 Young (onboard):</b> You want me to pass it up to you?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 34 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No. Yeah. I hate for the cook to do that. (Laughter )</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 40 Duke (onboard):</b> Here's your urine bag.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 44 Young (onboard):</b> I just emptied it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 45 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh, you're a nice guy. Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 13 49 Young (onboard):</b> I had to have a urine before I started making the tow - the chow. I have - Oh, you dumb - it feels like it put hot water in the orange juice, but it didn't.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 14 00 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, the first shot'll be hot.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 14 02 Young (onboard):</b> The whole thing's getting hot.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 14 03 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No. It - Yeah. Man, one of the feats of my existence the other day was, in 42 minutes, I strapped on a bag, went out of both ends, and ate lunch.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 14 24 Duke (onboard):</b> Fantastic, that's a record!</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 14 28 Mattingly (onboard):</b> By doing it all at one time. (Laughter).</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 14 31 Young (onboard):</b> Doing it all at the same time?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 14 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter) I had this bag on the front end, a plastic bag on my rear, and a juice bag in my mouth (laughter). That's the only chance I had all day. With one back-side pass. I used to want to be the first man to Mars. This has convinced me that, if we got to go on Apollo, I ain't interested (laughter). I tell you, it's really surprising how one man in this vehicle, once you get - if you get squared away, there's enough room - and you can do more with one man in here than you can with three, operating all the equipment and everything. And I wouldn't have guessed that.</p>
				<p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 190 hours, 15 minutes [190:03] Ground Elapsed Time.

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 15 27 Young (onboard):</b> It's like a three-man Gemini now.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 15 29 Duke (onboard):</b> Actually, I can't get out of the way.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 15 31 Young (onboard):</b> It's like a three-man Gemini. There was no room in there.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 15 38 Duke (onboard):</b> I don't see how y'all did it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 15 40 Young (onboard):</b> Not very well [garble]. More hot cocoa or cold cocoa?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 15 52 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Hot, please.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 15 53 Young (onboard):</b> Okay. This is with K.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 17 Young (onboard):</b> You want to cut your open - orange juice open? [Garble] more cold water in there.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I wonder who's responsible for all this?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 47 Duke (onboard):</b> Dr [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 48 Young (onboard):</b> Probably no one.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 49 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 52 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, but this - this regrouping is just - you know.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 55 Young (onboard):</b> Atrocious.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 16 56 Mattingly (onboard):</b> If we hadn't talked about this beforehand, you know, I wouldn't feel quite so irritated. But we talked about this very specific problem, and I talked to all the flight directors about it. It's - if you've got to regroup with the kind of Flight Plan we've got, just emasculate pieces. Don't try to reschedule. And they all agreed, that's right; if you have to reschedule and rewrite, we'll get even less done. And that's all I've done for three days. And my efficiency has got to be low. That's something. Gee, Charlie, I don't know. I'll be darned.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 17 42 Young (onboard):</b> What is it?</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 18 02 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Probably the -</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 18 21 Young (onboard):</b> That's right.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 18 22 Mattingly (onboard):</b> They'll tell me not to forget to turn the - I guess I am ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 18 27 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble] you'd think they'd accept the Flight Plan [garble]. And I checked the Master Arm, Off, [garble] checked the Master Arm, Off, verify. (Laughter).</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 18 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Somebody has really gone Able Sugar over there.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 18 48 Young (onboard):</b> Really - There was two of them like that - there was two of them in there that said verify. You want me to cut this open, Ken?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 18 55 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yes, please, sir. Yes, I've made several notes in my Flight Plan to quit wasting time reading up trivial things.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 08 Young (onboard):</b> That's what - the outfit's so big now that that's their goal in life. And that's no bull. I can see it. Chris [probably Chris Kraft] doesn't know all this bull is going on or he wouldn't allow it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 20 Duke (onboard):</b> What outfit [garble]?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 24 Young (onboard):</b> FAO, MCC - FAO, probably. They got ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 28 Duke (onboard):</b> That's our guys.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 29 Young (onboard):</b> That's right! But they've got these TRW weenies working for them and they're - you know, what they're gonna do is correct typographical errors on the Flight Plan next.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter) Well. When all the trivial things have been done, they did get us down to the ground.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 53 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 19 54 Duke (onboard):</b> What? Pages and pages of corrections? [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 05 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh, not sometimes. Just the last three days (laughter).</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 12 Young (onboard):</b> I don't see how you stood it - I really don't.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 15 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I don't either, as a matter of fact.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 17 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble] bad, but with three guys, it's gonna be unbearable.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 19 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I ain't the most ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 20 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 21 Mattingly (onboard):</b> ... stable guy in the world for that kind of stuff, anyhow. And I'm quite impressed that I ain't popped off at them. But it ain't an accident.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 20 29 Young (onboard):</b> It takes [garble] easy going to do it. I'll tell you that, because I got mad at them yesterday. Didn't do any good.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 21 10 Young (onboard):</b> What? They eat with one hand and urinate with the other? Is that right?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 21 18 Duke (onboard):</b> They wipe with one hand.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 21 22 Young (onboard):</b> They won't use any paper, huh?</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 25 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Hey, you should look at that - that corona at sunrise. That's really pretty.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 25 13 Young (onboard):</b> Charlie, what else do you want? You don't want any bacon squares, huh, Charlie?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 25 15 Duke (onboard):</b> No. Just some - Just like some juices.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 25 32 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 25 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Now where did I put my Flight - Yes, sir, we are in attitude and...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 25 42 Young (onboard):</b> Who you talking to?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 25 45 Young (onboard):</b> Oh, it'll be - the horizon right now is right down here. If you'll turn the - turn the floodlights down, you'll probably see it right now.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 07 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 11 Mattingly (onboard):</b> [Garble] find it, I'll show you [garble]. Well - Yeah, it may be because the old terminator's moving around pretty rapidly. When it comes up, you can see it - you can see it nicely with the cabin lights up and everything. It's - it's really pretty.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 32 Young (onboard):</b> Ken, you're kicking this stuff off the food bay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 35 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 36 Young (onboard):</b> No problem.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 37 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I'm sorry.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 45 Young (onboard):</b> You can put your foots on there now.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 49 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, I don't put my feet on the dinner table.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 52 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 26 53 Young (onboard):</b> I think you put your left hand on it the other day; you might as well put your feet on it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 27 01 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Now, now. I know what I'll do. I'll fold my tent. Suit donning. Ah! An exercise in futility. The - the thing is that what we have to do now is, after suit donning, we still - when we go to doff the suits now we still got to go back and stow stuff in the places that was gonna originally have been stowed.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 27 35 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 27 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> In fact, I tell you what, when you guys go into the LM to don the suits, I can go stow that stuff before I put my suit on.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 27 50 Young (onboard):</b> That's a good idea.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 27 52 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Hey, that'll - that'll get it done a lot faster.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 27 59 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 28 02 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay. You know we can always handle stuff like that. That's no big deal.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 28 10 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 28 12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, I tell you, I - I'm - I'm really confused, because I am thoroughly convinced that what John's been saying about everything goes up to the tunnel is true. And in SIM bay attitude with only the minus-X jets firing, that makes sense. And it's true I'll wake up in the morning, and the - the Tool E is always hanging that way, the jett bag's up there, all my trash is going up there. It's a - it's a self-cleaning cockpit.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 28 41 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 28 43 Mattingly (onboard):</b> But when you go to couples, they still hang up there. And I ain't figured that out.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 28 51 Young (onboard):</b> Well, I'll tell you why. Undocked, it's colder up there. They settle out when the cold hits there. Pressure changes.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 29 03 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 29 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> We're gonna do it earlier than that, old buddy. There is - there is only one - one way to survive with MSFN. And that's to get ahead and don't tell them. Now we're coming up on time to open the hatch now. Sit there in your suit. Huh? What do you mean? </p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 29 30 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 29 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay. That's - that's all you do. All you're doing is seeing that they've got in the command that runs the tape. Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 29 40 Young (onboard):</b> Juice for you, Charlie. What else do you need?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 29 44 Duke (onboard):</b> I might have been [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 29 50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter) Well, I'm ready to say, at this point, I don't care. All they can do is tell me to come home, which they have already done. And they ain't gonna take my next flight away from me, so - </p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 30 14 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Really does upset me. All the time you put into trying to make it a good one, and then someone that hasn't given it any real thought or effort comes up and wipes it all out with a stroke of his hand.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 30 30 Duke (onboard):</b> What's his name? [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 30 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well - not - that's - Okay, but that's different. That 's unavoidable, you know, and we regrouped from that nicely. We got everything done that we would have done - at least on my end, I got everything done that I would have done had we not slipped that three revs. So that was no - you know, that - that part worked out okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 31 03 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 31 11 Mattingly (onboard):</b> But - then - then to cause this - you know, that we regrouped from without a great deal of trouble, and everybody knew we had to regroup. But this, I just don't - I just don't understand it. We're gonna end up doing things halfway.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 31 42 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble] yesterday [garble] It wasn't working right [garble] they said, "Okay. You got an hour and a half." [Garble] Okay. You got that one? Come around and get this [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Just sitting there in a limit cycle.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 15 Duke (onboard):</b> [garble] and I don't think [garble] we [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 18 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I know.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 19 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 20 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No. That's right. It's better to take a plan you understand and is thought out that is less than optimum and execute it the way you planned it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 29 Duke (onboard):</b> All we had to do was take our checklist and subtract 10 minutes from this, subtract 10 minutes from that [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 40 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 41 Young (onboard):</b> They didn't do that.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 43 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I thought that's why we picked these kind of people throughout the program - was people that understood how to operate as opposed to how to have meetings. But it's been a - this has looked more like a - an operational data priority than a -</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 32 58 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble] they're not. I don't ever expect those guys to understand the ...</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 33 34 Young (onboard):</b> No, you - that's what you ate this morning. I just fixed it for you.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 33 37 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh. Well, you've got to eat one.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 33 40 Young (onboard):</b> Oh, well, I ain't got around to that.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 33 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, you can't - you can't button up your toys. You've got to go ...</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 33 46 Young (onboard):</b> You want to - you want these in here?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 33 48 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 34 02 Young (onboard):</b> If I eat it, I'm going to have to defecate.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 34 22 Young (onboard):</b> Here you go, Charlie. How many you want? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. The pills are floating!</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 34 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh. I'll do that. Hey, Charlie? Oh, the IR was hiding it. That's why you couldn't see it. Here.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 34 57 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble] see it.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 34 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> See a corner of it. Look straight out the [garble] It's almost sunrise. Aw, you missed it. Get your head out of there before it comes up. Okay.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 35 27 Young (onboard):</b> Come here, you little pills.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 35 46 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You know, one of the things I found worked real well was, instead of using the - the big trash bag - (laughter) - That one just got shot down - was to keep one little temporary trash bag out that was easy to get in and out of. And put stuff in it, and then every - couple times a day, dump that into the big trash bag. </p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 36 07 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, That's what I got between my legs, I think.</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 36 14 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Looks like we overdid it. I should've kept - I thought about keeping one of those jett bags [garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 36 19 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 36 22 Young (onboard):</b> I can't! There's no way.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>190 36 34 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Pull up the ladder. I tell you what. If you - are you using that table?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 36 39 Young (onboard):</b> No, not right this second. Gonna change that LiOH canister?</p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>190 36 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. The other terminator is prettier, because it's- got more - relief to it.</p>

The Flight Control team in Mission Control has elected not to do a GET clock update from 191 hours to 212 hours 48 minutes at this time. Not doing this update at this time, we assure continuity and data being processed in the Mission Control Center from the last clock update through TEI. The computers in Mission Control sit and work from a common time. This common time [is] midnight the night before launch. This update, if we chose to do it at this time, could conceivably have the effect of making the computers think that we launched Apollo 16 before that time if all elements of the MCC were thoroughly attuned to the update. We were not sure that we had enough time to do that, so, our flight control team elected to be conservative and leave the option open for a clock update later. We're at 190 hours 59 minutes [190:47] and standing by now for acquisition with Apollo 16.</p><a name="190_49_51"></a>

There's a 10-minute pad in there. And, at 192:10 [191:58], we work through those changes down to the point where I read you "Start hatch closing" at 194:23 [194:11]. And, at 194:27 [194:15], we want to jump back to the "LM jett procedures," and there is only one change in that. So, I think that's the best place to go, which was at 176:50, originally.</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>190 55 38 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And, that's at 176:50 in the original Flight Plan, and 176:50 becomes 194:27 [194:15].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 55 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay; now stand by.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 56 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay; 176:50 becomes what, Hank?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 56 18 Hartsfield:</b> 194:27 [194:15].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 56 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay; that means that all these things now are gonna be off by this screwy number. Is that correct?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 56 41 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Until we get - That makes LM jett come out on time by going to this screwy number here, 194:27 [194:15]. And, we pick up there, and we don't ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 56 51 Mattingly:</b> And, that's the equivalent to 176:50?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 56 55 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 57 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I have crossed out 176:50, and I've called it 194:27 [194:15].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 57 06 Hartsfield:</b> That is correct. Now we do not ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 57 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 57 11 Hartsfield:</b> We delete the "VHF AM" and the "Configure the camera" business, and we pick up with the hatch closing. We already start with that. Now, you can start those things early. There is a - a little more time in here than was originally in the Flight Plan. And you don't have to do the ... </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 57 28 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. We're going to need a little more with those suit donnings.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 57 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; and the Direct O<sub>2</sub> Valve closed, you can delete that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 57 46 Hartsfield:</b> Now, other than changing your time columns like, turning the page there, the 177 there becomes 194:37 [194:25]. Everything is good through the sep maneuver. The only change is that at 194:49 [194:37], the Noun 81, make ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 58 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay; wait a minute. Let me get the time column changed.</p>
				<p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> Apollo Control Houston [at] 191 hours, 10 minutes [190:58] Ground Elapsed Time, our Flight Director in the control center today is Phil Shaffer, relieving Gene Kranz on this shift.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 58 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I got the time changed on the page. Now you can read me some times.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 59 01 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; 194:49, "The Noun 81 becomes minus 2.0 and 00." The CSM sep[aration] is at 2-foot-per-second retrograde. This is so we can get the CSM out in front of the LM for TEI. </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 59 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Is the LM not going to impact before we do TEI?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 59 38 Hartsfield:</b> I think the planning is now for about 3 hours after TEI. What they need to do is wait for the 210 antenna to come up so they can get data ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 59 47 Mattingly:</b> We're not even going to get pictures of it, huh?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>190 59 51 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative; no pictures. Okay; at 195:18 [195:06] ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 00 01 Mattingly:</b> All right.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 00 04 Hartsfield:</b> ... after "Roll (4), off," - that's the completion of the little block following the sep, you can insert a remark "Doff PGA's," and at this time, we jump back over to what was ... </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 00 20 Mattingly:</b> Wait a minute. I haven't found "Roll (4), off" yet.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 00 22 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, that's in the block after P00, after CSM sep 195:17 [195:05].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 00 31 Mattingly:</b> 195:17 [195:05] - I have as the first number on the top of the page.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 00 39 Hartsfield:</b> That should be 195:07 [194:55].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 00 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I mislabeled it. Thank you. Let me redo them.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 01 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay; now, at 195:17 [195:05], say again?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 01 13 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; 195:18 [195:06], after the completion of that little block, - that ends with "Roll (4), off," enter a little comment, "Doff PGAs," and go to Page 327. That was originally 217 hours in the Flight Plan.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 01 42 Mattingly:</b> If I ever find my way through here.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 01 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I've got Page 327</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 02 01 Hartsfield:</b> Are you there, now?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 02 07 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. Now, we want to do all these steps the that are down here at 195:20 or so, don't we? It says doff PGAs there, but we really want to do all these things do so in that group, right?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 02 28 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 03 04 Mattingly:</b> I tried to dry them out.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 03 10 Mattingly:</b> There's a towel that's right over your left shoulder, if you need it. If your wrap round there.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 03 43 Mattingly:</b> Oh, isn't space flight glamorous.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 04 03 Mattingly:</b> Tuck them into there...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 04 10 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, I guess I meant for you to do everything there except doffing the biomed harness, and the - of course, delete the uplinks and the other stuff..</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 04 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Then, we go to Page 327.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 04 30 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 04 31 Mattingly:</b> Is that right?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 04 32 Hartsfield:</b> And 217 hours becomes 195:10 [194:58], and that's the time bias from then on, if you want to start updating your times. And, where we come back in there is at the place - place where were supposed to uplink the vector. Where we start there is 195:18 [195:06].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 04 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now 217 is what?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 05 01 Hartsfield:</b> 217 becomes 195:10 [194:58]. </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 05 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And then we follow the rest of the flight plan All the way out?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 05 20 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We start at 195:18 [195:06], actually. We don't do those up-links. And, we pick up there at 195:18 and then from then on, we just follow sequentially - with all those little ... </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 05 36 Mattingly:</b> Why is it that there is no up-link in that? </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 05 45 Hartsfield:</b> Well, I've been advised that there's another Flight Plan change coming that's going to move the subsat blocks back a little bit, and to get in some mapping camera stuff. Okay; I got it straight now. We will not track the subsat.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 06 05 Mattingly:</b> You will not track the subsatellite. Not even a little bit. Is that correct?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 06 13 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. They're going to run the cameras to try to use the film.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 06 35 Mattingly:</b> All right, Hank. How about doing one thing for us, then? If this is going to be the basic time line, and we're going to use these pages, is it reasonable to get you to give us a clock sync somewhere - so we - I'm afraid if I keep scratch - scratching out times and all in here, I'm going to miss something important.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 06 57 Hartsfield:</b> Well, Ken, to fill you in on a little bit here, we originally planned a clock sync and that's why some of the confusion this morning. Then we found out that it wouldn't work, because it put the lift-off time prior to time of midnight and wasn't sure it would work, and we couldn't find out in time enough before we had to start giving you this up through the LM jett, so we're going to work on that possibility.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 07 24 Mattingly:</b> Well, okay. But for the time being, let's - let's just take one plan and run with it, and that is to update the times on every page.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 07 32 Hartsfield:</b> That's what we're doing.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 07 34 Mattingly:</b> Once we have - Yeah, okay. Okay. All right ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 07 28 Hartsfield:</b> You have your Nouns 93, Ken?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 07 49 Mattingly:</b> ... you want to talk to the LM guys while I do some page updatings? Huh?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 07 52 Hartsfield:</b> Do you have your Noun 93s from the P52?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 07 50 Mattingly:</b> What do you need, Hank? Oh, you want our - Well, let me find it. I don't know what page that's on now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 08 21 Mattingly:</b> You out them up there, how's the Delta-P?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 08 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 08 52 Mattingly:</b> Here we go, Hank. There was minus 0.1, plus 0.002, plus 0.095. That was torqued at 190:21:00 [190:09:10].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 09 05 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy. And, we need barber pole, plus 4.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 09 20 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. Yes.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 09 26 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, the last thing, if you can give us A/C Roll, and we're - then we'll be ready for the LM updates.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 09 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. A/C Roll.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 10 17 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Fredo's going to read up the LM changes if you give us the word whenever you're ready to copy.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 10 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay, stand by. You ready to copy the - the - Yeah -</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 13 35 Mattingly:</b> Hank, I'm a little confused, it looks like in places we've got a 12-minute difference, and in other places we've got a 10-minute difference from the times that are marked on here. Is that correct? Did I interpret that properly?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 13 49 Hartsfield:</b> Yeah, that's affirmative. We go back to the - to the LM jett procedures. There's just - you know, we fitted in to fit with the actual jett time, so that time difference is correct.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 14 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Does that mean things like AOS and all that will move the same amount, or is that different?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 14 14 Hartsfield:</b> We plan to give you updates on those as we go along.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 14 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p><a name="191_14_54"></a>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 14 54 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 15 00 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead. Go ahead, Fredo.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 15 03 Haise:</b> Okay; we got quite a batch to give you here out of the Contingency Book in the time line. And I guess you'll have to drag out a different color writing utensil than you used yesterday, because you're going to be writing over some things you already did on the Time Line Book.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 15 24 Mattingly:</b> Well, right now, Fredo, we'll - we'll have to stand by for a minute.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 15 29 Haise:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 15 50 Mattingly:</b> We've got all colors, especially black, Fredo. </p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 16 00 Haise:</b> That's nice.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 16 20 Duke:</b> Okay, Fred.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 16 24 Haise:</b> Okay. Is this Charlie?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 16 39 Duke:</b> How's that, Fred? How are you reading now?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 16 42 Haise:</b> Okay; loud and clear, Charlie. And, where you need to be is on page 2-1, phase 1, of the Module Activation.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 16 55 Duke:</b> That's where I am.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 16 58 Haise:</b> Okay. Right at the top there, when you IVT to the LM, there's a note that says "Use the CSM comm umbilical." As bad as that LM's comm has been, we're not really going to be in good shape there until almost before LOS, when we get to steerable attitude. Okay; and otherwise there ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 17 20 Duke:</b> Okay; what do you mean?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 17 22 Haise:</b> Okay; in Step 1, you can scratch the second line, and write in "Carry CSM O<sub>2</sub> hose across."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 17 39 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 17 40 Haise:</b> Okay at the end of Step 2 - And incidentally, we need the hose because we're not going to bring on the suit fans - At the end of Step 2 there, put a note in that says to give us the CB configuration on 11 and 16. And I guess all we really need is the ones closed, because there shouldn't be too many that are closed.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 18 13 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 17 40 Haise:</b> Okay; Item 3, first line, make that "Ascent H<sub>2</sub>O," and the second line, make it the ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 18 26 Duke:</b> Okay. That's reasonable.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 18 28 Haise:</b> Yes. And likewise, second line is number 1 Ascent O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 18 36 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 18 37 Haise:</b> Okay; you can scratch the "Cabin Repress to Auto," the next line, and substitute "Press Regs A and B to Egress," and that is indicated as being a verify.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 18 55 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 18 57 Haise:</b> We'd like to retain the next line there, that "Cabin Repress breakers," so you've got the caution and warnings.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 19 07 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 19 09 Haise:</b> Okay. Another little block you might write out to the left there, label it "Transfer Items." And, maybe you've already done some of these, but this will take care of some of the ones we missed having you do yesterday. And they're the PTK(?), the Flight Kit, the purse with the unused food, and the used fecal-urine bags, and lastly the DSEA.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 19 57 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 19 59 Haise:</b> Okay; beside the subheading near "Power transfer" write in 192:15.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 20 10 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 20 12 Haise:</b> Okay, now that whole block that says "If no CSM power", we're going to use to effect the transfer except we're kind of changing it around, so you can just scratch that "If no CSM power." Go down ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 20 28 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 20 30 Haise:</b> ... go down to the fourth line and change the "Ascent ECA Control, Close" to "Ascent ECA, Close."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 20 45 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 20 h6 Haise:</b> After that, add a step that is "Cross Tie Bus and Balance Loads, Open."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 03 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 04 Haise:</b> Now, that's gonna temporarily wipe out the LMP bus, but don't worry about it. The next step is "Bat 5 Normal Feed, On," so we'll get it back there. Okay ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 14 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 16 Haise:</b> ... after the "Bat 5 step," add in, and you'll have to write it out to the left there, I guess, "CSM LM Power, Off," followed by "Bat 6 Normal Feed, On, talkback gray."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 39 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 41 Haise:</b> Okay. Out beside "CB (11) and (16) EPS," scratch the first line there. That's "Descent ECA Control, two, Close."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 52 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 21 55 Haise:</b> Okay, and then starting two lines down: where it's "Bat 1 Low Voltage, On," et cetera, just scratch the whole rest of those lines in that box.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 07 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 10 Haise:</b> Okay, below that, Step 1, "Transfer to LM power," you can scratch all of those lines, all five.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 19 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 21 Haise:</b> Step 2, "Flood Light to All," but then scratch the next three lines.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 31 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 34 Haise:</b> Okay. Page 2-2, under step 1 you can scratch everything in parentheses.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 44 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 46 Haise:</b> Under Step 2, Line 2, scratch "Descent ECA Control, Close.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 57 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 22 58 Haise:</b> Then all four items that are under "CB(16)Stab/Control," from there on, these four lines, scratch.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 23 10 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 23 13 Haise:</b> Okay. Now, the next Step 3 items, plus the block there about "When bus volts less than 27, high voltage taps," scratch all that clear on down on down to "ECS activation."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 23 27 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 23 29 Haise:</b> "ECS activation," Step 1, third line, CB (11) you can scratch - Stand by one.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 00 Haise:</b> Okay, Charlie. That's correct. "CB (11) ECS Suit Fan 1, close," scratch that line.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 08 Duke:</b> I got it scratched.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 10 Haise:</b> Okay; and the circuit breaker below that, "Glycol Pump, two, Close," change the two to a one.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 20 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 22 Haise:</b> Okay; then the next two lines at the bottom there, "Press Reg A and B," "Suit Gas Diverters," scratch those.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 32 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 33 Haise:</b> Add a line below that, "Glycol to Pump 1."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 41 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 24 43 Haise:</b> Okay, ready for 2-3, and Step 2, you can scratch the first line about "If LM is to be active", et cetera. And, just the Prime Evap "Flow 1, Open." That's Step 2, now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 04 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 06 Haise:</b> Okay. "Configure Audio" block here, delete Steps 1 and 2.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 15 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 18 Haise:</b> Okay; Step 3, the second line, "Commander Audio, Close," scratch that one.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 30 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 32 Haise:</b> In its place, write in "Secondary Power, Amp, Close."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 40 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 43 Haise:</b> Next line, "Signal Sensor, Close," scratch that one.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 48 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 50 Haise:</b> Okay; let's go to Step 4. On the S-Band at ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 54 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 25 56 Haise:</b> ... across there, it should read "PM Secondary" and change "Primary to Secondary."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 09 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 11 Haise:</b> Okay; the second line there, rather than "Off/RESET," make it "Range."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 19 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 20 Haise:</b> And, rather than "Lo," make it "Hi."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 27 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 29 Haise:</b> And, since you're not gonna be plugged in, you can scratch that "Hot mike to MSFN."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 36 Duke:</b> How about that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 41 Haise:</b> Yeah, we'll really miss that. Okay, Charlie. The next line "S-Band Antenna," we want "Forward." So, you can scratch the "or AFT."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 26 56 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 27 01 Haise:</b> Next block, "Caution and warning turn on." Under the "Warning" light, the "RCS A Reg" - Then put a parenthesis here; it's possible, you can scratch "RCS B Reg."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 27 21 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 27 23 Haise:</b> Under "Caution" lights, you can scratch "Pre Amp."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 27 28 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 27 31 Haise:</b> Okay; and under the "Glycol" note, you can add two more caution lights, "RCS and ECS."</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>191 40 32 Mattingly:</b> All right, Henry. I'll be there in just a minute. I just finished your SIM Bay stuff. And, Henry, could you have an EECOM check and see if our sensor and accumulator looks like it's been working properly in the last hour?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 47 04 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; will do. Okay, EECOM says that they can see it's receiving the stroke signal, but they have no way of telling if it really does stroke.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 47 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Seems like it has gotten a little stuffy and the humidity has built up a little bit, and I was just wondering is there some way I could verify that it is working without having to watch this high O<sub>2</sub> Flow on - watch the O<sub>2</sub> Flow sensor. Can they - they have the Flow sensor; can they tell if it - if it's been getting its flow pulse?</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>191 51 23 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, that's what, we've been running on - I don't ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 51 48 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, the LiOH canister you had trouble with, has it already been put in the LM for good?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 51 57 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. I've got it stowed on board.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 51 59 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, real good. We'd like to bring that thing home.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 52 00 Mattingly:</b> It was the one I took out last night; Okay; I had a little trouble with the one yesterday morning, but not so much, and it's already in the LM. Last night I was getting concerned that we picked up some humidity and it was swelling.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 52 17 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 52 29 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Ken, what we'd like to do, is get Canister 13 to the LM in place of the one we're bringing home.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 52 43 Mattingly:</b> Say again, Henry.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 52 45 Hartsfield:</b> I said did you make a substitute for the one that you're going to keep there or ...</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 52 55 Mattingly:</b> I'm sorry, I still haven't understood you. Say again, one more time, please.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 53 01 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; we're going to keep the canister that's bad. We're going to bring it home so we can look at it, so did you substitute another one to be jettisoned with the LM?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 53 13 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. I packed all that stuff yesterday sometime, and it's over in the LM in a jett bag, and if we have extra canisters, I'd just as soon leave it that way if we could.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 53 24 Hartsfield:</b> We concur.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 53 28 Mattingly:</b> We're having enough trouble staying up the time line, without digging through a jett bag looking for a canister.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 53 31 Hartsfield:</b> We don't want to do that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 53 37 Mattingly:</b> Easy on that baby [garble]. Okay, Hank. You got the one that stuck last night. It's down in - in A -A-3, I believe it is the first one. And let's leave it at that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>191 53 53 Hartsfield:</b> We concur.</p>

				<p class="obcm"><b>192 00 00 Mattingly (onboard):</b> And we're coming through here. We're about on the time line, but the trouble is, they didn't allow enough time. If we don't get ahead somewhere, we'll never make it.

				<p class="obcm"><b>192 00 17 Duke (onboard):</b> That's right.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 00 18 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I can't follow that. I keep trying. So we're right down here, now. Jettison comes up - Let's see, have you got it? Got this 30 minutes, here's 30, there's an hour. But most of this is gonna get taken up with suit donning. And I've got to reconfigure the cockpit here. And then we close the hatches and do the jettison over here. And then I know good and well they're gonna have - they're gonna have us do all kinds of stuff in here. It won't be nice and clean like this. They're gonna be rolling left, reading updates, and all that bull. During the eat period, you're gonna take your suit off. I'm almost at the point of just saying, forget it, I'll keep my suit on for EVA.

				<p class="obcm"><b>192 17 34 Mattingly (onboard):</b> We were doing it with an 06 20 of a mark and an Enter right then and there that'd correct it. Huh? Oh, wait a minute. Let me go to SCS, I can get you a smaller dead band with that.

				<p class="obcm"><b>192 19 55 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 20 11 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay. It'll be plus 45, 361, 304 - What's the Command Module?
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 20 46 Duke (onboard):</b> That's 304. This is 304, minus 323. Be a minus number [garble] in the 300s. 300 plus 4 is 304.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 21 30 Young (onboard):</b> Add 360 to that one [garble]. Yeah. Make it - yeah, why not? Okay.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 21 46 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 21 47 Young (onboard):</b> Now subtract ...
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 21 48 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 21 49 Young (onboard):</b> ... 33, 3, 1, 4, 3 - 341.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 21 58 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah. I do, too. Okay, now this one is plus 160 and [garble] is straight forward to [garble] 6. Okay, that looks okay. Well, John, don't get to [garble].
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 22 45 Young (onboard):</b> Huh?

				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 23 13 Duke (onboard):</b> I don't know what you're gonna do with that. Can't roll it, stick it on itself. You could put a piece of tape on the back of it, John. Here, let me do that.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 23 20 Young (onboard):</b> Oh, yeah. I'll - I'll -
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 23 22 Duke (onboard):</b> You do this, and I'll (laughter) [garble].

				<p class="obcm"><b>192 33 22 Duke (onboard):</b> Is it bad?
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 33 33 Duke (onboard):</b> That was really a dumb decision. And it was all because the docs got them panicked.
				<p>
				<p class="obcm"><b>192 33 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> It goes further than that, Charlie.

				<p class="tech"><b>193 24 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You mentioned something about we're gonna get a whole lot of Mapping and Pan Camera stuff in there in those revs between there and TEI.

				<p class="tech"><b>193 33 13 Duke:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 33 15 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. On Panel 11, and I think you're already there - you checked, you got Pump 1, Pump 2, and the Auto Transfer breakers closed.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 33 30 Duke:</b> That's affirm. It's set up.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 33 33 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Switch to Pump 2.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 33 45 Duke:</b> Okay. Pump 2.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 33 46 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Open the Auto Transfer circuit breaker and then switch back to Pump 1.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 34 01 Duke:</b> You're back to Pump 1.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 34 03 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. And, lastly, Charlie, close the Auto Transfer breaker, and we're back in business.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 34 11 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 35 39 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we're ready for Mass Spec, Retract.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 36 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The mass spec is coming now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 36 18 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 37 20 Hartsfield:</b> Orion, Houston. Did you load your DAP before you started the P30?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 37 51 Hartsfield:</b> We need Auto on the High Gain, Casper.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 38 55 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, our plan for the - for the camera work is, at about 196:45 [196:33], somewhere in there, it's sunrise. We plan to run the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter throughout the - the daylight part of that Rev, up to about 197:50 [197:38]. And we'll bring the Pan Camera on at about - oh, a third of the way through that daylight portion, about 197:15 [197:03], and run it until darkness. And we'll do a Solar Corona just prior to that, and maybe some handheld photography, which we'll read up to you after you doff your suits on the next rev.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 40 30 Mattingly:</b> Houston, Orion.</p>

				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 15 Mattingly:</b> Good.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 16 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 21 Mattingly:</b> Hello, Henry. Glad to have you back.</p><a name="193_43_23"></a>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 23 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We had a little trouble with the network there. It appears that the Mass Spec boom is jammed, and we'd like for you to give it a 15-second Deploy and then back to Retract.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. 15-second Deploy and back to Retract. Stand by.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 43 Mattingly:</b> Deploy.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 50 Mattingly:</b> How far did it look like it went before it jammed?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 43 55 Hartsfield:</b> About a third of the way in.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 44 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay. There's 15 seconds, and I'm going to Retract.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 44 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. Charlie has a visual on it, and it stopped again.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 44 34 Hartsfield:</b> Our data confirms that, Ken.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 44 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 44 57 Mattingly:</b> I've got the switch in the Off position now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 45 03 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Ken, would you give us one more of those 15-second Deploy and back to Retract?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 45 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay. How about if I just take it all the way out?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 45 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Why don't you go ahead and try it? We have data shows it's stalling both ways.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 45 42 Mattingly:</b> It's going out now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 46 32 Hartsfield:</b> Orion, we'd like you to verify Forward Omni before you secure the LM.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 46 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. It - it didn't go all the way out and Charlie can visually verify that it is not all the way out.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 46 56 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Would you try another Retract?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 47 02 Mattingly:</b> It's going to Retract now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 48 43 Mattingly:</b> Houston, can we start the new maneuver to the jett attitude? Over.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 48 49 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by 16.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 49 25 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Give us the SIM bay roll-jet configuration and start your Verb 49. I think that's what you've got in there now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 49 38 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. It is.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 49 44 Hartsfield:</b> And you are No Go for coupled jets. I think we're going to have to jettison that boom. We're look at that now.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 49 56 Mattingly:</b> OOkay. Is that a requirement for - the LM jettison, you mean?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 50 10 Hartsfield:</b> We'll get you an answer to that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 50 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We're gonna keep the boom for LM jett, but keep the SIM bay jet configuration, so we don't go coupled.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 50 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. If we stay in the SIM bay jet configuration, what's this gonna do to our translation capability for the maneuver? We gonna have to line it all up in one axis?</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 51 32 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Ken. Minus X is what we want to do on that sep maneuver, anyhow.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 51 39 Mattingly:</b> Roger. But that's probably not going to line up with the - with the attitude I'm unlocking in, is it? Normally that turns out to be a three-axis burn.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 51 54 Hartsfield:</b> Maneuver to get it all in minus-X, and then do it.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 52 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. So you want me to maneuver to the minus-X attitude first.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 52 12 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We want to get the sep maneuver all in X, and I've got FDO trying to get you an attitude for that.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 52 20 Mattingly:</b> Well, I can probably figure that out from Noun 41, I mean, P41.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 54 30 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, FDO says the maneuver attitude to get that minus-X thruster is pitch, 327; yaw, 0; and roll, whatever you have.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 54 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That'll be whatever roll we have, pitch of 327, and a yaw of 0.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 54 58 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And we'd like to remind you we will need Omni Delta for AOS next time and to change the "verify" to a "configure the DSE after LOS to Low Bit Rate; Record; Forward."</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 55 15 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 55 59 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. You're looking good at LOS, and AOS will be at 194:57 [194:45].</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 56 10 Mattingly:</b> Roger. And we're feeling good, too.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 57 11 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, to reiterate: as far as that boom is concerned, it's the roll jets we're concerned with. They're the only ones we have to keep single jet on.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 57 26 Young:</b> Ken is off comm; he's suiting up.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 57 28 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 57 38 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, John, would you - would you tell Ken that on that boom out, our only concern is going coupled on the roll. So when he gets ready to do this burn, if he just wants to use X and Z and just leave his Y-translation - you know, make a 90-degree roll and burn a Z. Now, Ken can handle it any way he wants, but just let him know our only concern is coupled jets in roll.</p>
				<p class="tech"><b>193 58 09 Young:</b> Okay. Understand.</p><a name="193_58"></a>
				<p class="ed">[Loss of Signal at about 193:58.]</p>
				<p class="ed">[No recording for this backside pass.]</p>
				<p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 194 hours, 12 minutes [194:00] Ground Elapsed Time. We've had a Loss Of Signal with Apollo 16. As the spacecraft passes over the backside of the Moon on its 61st revolution the recalcitrant boom referred to as the Mass Spectrometer boom. This item [is] approximately 25 feet in length from its stowed position. It is formed by tempered steel tape. It is electrically connected to the SIM bay via [a] cable at deployment. If the boom cannot be retracted due to malfunction the boom activating mechanism, boom and experiment can be jettisoned. Its location in the Service Module is in close proximity to the point of subsatellite deployment so we would not want the boom extended at the time of subsatellite deployment. Also because of the limited mechanical strains of the boom, the boom must be retracted before any Service Propulsion System firings. I repeat, if the boom cannot be retracted due to malfunction the boom activating mechanism, boom and experiment can be jettisoned. We're at 194 hours, 14 minutes [194:02] Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
				<p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 194 hours, 19 minutes [194:07] Ground Elapsed Time. A new data [sic] from our experiments controller indicates that we will be able to launch the subsatellite with [the] boom extended, it does not represent a constraint. The only constraint we're presently faced is the burning of the Service Propulsion System engine so our cutoff time for retraction or jettison will be the Trans-Earth Injection burn when the Service Propulsion System engine would be used. We're at 194 hours, 20 minutes [194:08] Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p><a name="194_35"></a>
