        <p class="oblm"><b>176 18 08 Duke (LM onboard):</b> About 2 feet a second. And you're about 3 - about 2.5 feet a second from the ground. And the Z comparison is 9 feet a second, so AGS and PGNS are both good.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 18 20 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay. Well, we're righter than they are, I'm sure of that.</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>176 20 58 Duke (LM onboard):</b> No, they're all right. It's just - see, they want me to keep my solution independent here. See how it does. 35, 104; it's pretty close. Is that okay with you? Or you want me to load Noun 86?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 21 11 Young (LM onboard):</b> No, that's all right.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 21 12 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Huh?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 21 13 Young (LM onboard):</b> That's okay, we can burn anyway. Who want - who wanted you to do that? Are you doing this for Jerry Thomas?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 21 20 Duke (LM onboard):</b> No. It's just in the procedures. It's been that way. They said that - that if the solutions agree close enough to pass the test, to keep them independent.

        <p class="oblm"><b>176 42 35 Duke (LM onboard):</b> 30 degrees.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 42 37 Young (LM onboard):</b> That's what I figured. So a 30-degree transfer angle - at 15 minutes, we should have 2 milliradians ...</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 42 56 Duke (LM):</b> Man, you're in the Sun, Ken, and you're the brightest thing I've ever seen in my life!</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 04 Young (LM onboard):</b> This thing is right on. We've got a 1-milliradian bias, and it says it's 2-1/2 milliradians, and it should be 2 milliradians.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 13 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Instant sunrise!</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 19 Young (LM onboard):</b> Absolutely spectacular!</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 22 Duke (LM):</b> Okay; my tracking light's off, Ken.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 30 Mattingly:</b> You make a pretty good-size star.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 36 Duke (LM):</b> You're bri ...</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 37 Mattingly:</b> By golly, in the sextant, I can even tell what you are.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 44 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay. We're at 60 degrees, huh, Charlie?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 43 48 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 01 Young (LM onboard):</b> I hope we get there before this lunar dust eats us alive.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 09 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Me, too.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 30 Young (LM onboard):</b> What a heck of a thing to have happen to you at lift-off.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 32 Duke (LM onboard):</b> What? Yeah, I know it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 34 Young (LM onboard):</b> I mean, I couldn't see out of it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 35 Duke (LM onboard):</b> I was worried.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 37 Young (LM onboard):</b> Well, there's noth - no need to worry. I was going - I was going to [garble] [garble].</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 44 40 Duke (LM onboard):</b> 277, 62 degrees, and we've got 60,000 feet.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 05 Duke (LM):</b> Just about right on the line, John. Okay. You - we got you 59,000 feet, Ken; 72 feet a second.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 13 Young (LM onboard):</b> Look at this thing. It hasn't fired a thruster in three minutes, Charlie.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 16 Duke (LM onboard):</b> I know it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 18 Young (LM onboard):</b> Fantastic. If you'll hold still, it won't fire any, once it figures out where the cg is. What a machine.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 34 Young (LM onboard):</b> [Garble][garble].</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 35 Mattingly:</b> You've still got some particles dangling along with you.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 40 Young (LM):</b> Man, I wouldn't be surprised! Wait until you open the hatch.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 44 Duke (LM):</b> (Laughter)</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 52 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, this is sort of a travelling dog and pony show. </p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 45 59 Duke (LM):</b> You ought to have seen old A. J. Foyt and Barney Oldfield all rolled into one on that Rover, Ken. I mean he really put it through its paces.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 09 Young (LM):</b> You ought to see that flat - lands out there.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 13 Duke (LM):</b> Whoever called that the Cayley Plains was an idiot.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 17 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, man. There isn't a flat spot in the whole place!</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 19 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter)</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 22 Duke (LM):</b> There were - there were some deep sinkholes out there, Ken, that must have been 70, 80 meters deep, and they weren't even on the maps.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 28 Mattingly:</b> I believe that. Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 31 Young (LM):</b> You saw them?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 32 Mattingly:</b> No, but I just - that sounds like what you'd - about - how close we could come on a [garble].</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 44 Duke (LM):</b> And old deadeye, here, picked the only flat spot within 2 kilometers to land on.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 50 Young (LM):</b> That was luck, I think, more than anything else.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 54 Duke (LM):</b> Fifty meters in any direction, John, and we'd have had a 10-degree tilt.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 46 59 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, we would have.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 00 Duke (LM):</b> No, well, maybe 5, but -</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 04 Young (LM onboard):</b> Heck, 50 meters backwards and we'd have been a lot worse than that.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 09 Duke (LM):</b> We'd have been in deep trouble. Ken, 10 - 10 feet behind the aft footpad was about a 12-foot-deep crater about 20 feet across.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 22 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Could you see it on the approach?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 27 Young (LM):</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 28 Mattingly:</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 29 Duke (LM):</b> He says he did.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 31 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, I did. I inched over it. I saw the dang - I saw the - I saw - I saw the ground all the way to touchdown, Ken. These guys have been saying they can't see the ground. I saw it.</p> <a name="176_47"></a>
        <p class="ed">176 47 Start Lunar Rev 53</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 43 Duke (LM):</b> I - Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 44 Young (LM):</b> I didn't have any trouble nulling the velocity.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 46 Duke (LM):</b> I was amazed, John, that - really that - that we -</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 4751 Young (LM onboard):</b> Did you see it?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 47 52 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, I did. But there wasn't - that there was not as much dust because of the soft regolith there. It was really spongy.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 00 Young (LM):</b> [Garble] [garble].</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 01 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay, 46,000 at 72 - 46.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 18 Young (LM):</b> Hey, listen, they reported some data that Izzy got; said the - said that the Cayley Plains was salithic [?] but not as much as the eastern highlands that you guys got. And they said that your gear was working good except for the laser altimeter, which was doing something. </p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 35 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. That's when we'd been rewriting the Flight Plan.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 40 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, I know it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 42 Duke (LM):</b> I can imagine.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 43 Young (LM):</b> You should have seen what the heck's been going on - Well, I'm sure you know.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 48 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, we got 43,000 feet, Ken.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 48 56 Duke (LM):</b> You are really bright, babe.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 08 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] against the lunar surface.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 13 Duke (LM onboard):</b> What?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 14 Mattingly:</b> You really look pretty against the lunar surface.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 16 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Oh.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49.18 Mattingly:</b> You got the little split imagery in through there.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 21 Young (LM onboard):</b> You do? The red against the - the star against a red background?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 22 Mattingly:</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 23 Young (LM onboard):</b> When I first saw that on Apollo 10, I thought I was in 2001. I couldn't figure out what was happening, because the - the guys I was tracking were up above me at the time, for some reason.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 49 39 Mattingly:</b> Now we've moved [garble] Now I'm seeing the - the Moon through the [garble] behind you, I think. It's not red anymore, anyhow [garble] looks like cartoon characters someone would draw.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 03 Young (LM onboard):</b> I really think we ought to let that all get out of here before we try to take our helmets and gloves off, if we can - if we can possibly help it. Golly, what an approach angle; 68 degrees at -</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 16 Duke (LM onboard):</b> We're right - almost right on the line.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 18 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 30 Young (LM):</b> Listen, I don't care if they're bringing us home, because we got a [garble] or what - you know, if that's what the reason is. If it's for some other reason, then I'm mad.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 36 Mattingly:</b> I think it's for some other reason.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 38 Duke (LM):</b> Such as that gimbal motor.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 41 Mattingly:</b> I'm sure of it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 42 Young (LM):</b> It's probably - it's probably starting to grind on the manager.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 44 Mattingly:</b> Yep [garble] go home [garble] could say that.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 50 59 Young (LM):</b> It ain't - you didn't make the dang gimbal motor. You did the right thing. Boy, and - if - if it had been me up there, I probably would have aborted the whole bloody thing. I don't care what they'd have said.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 10 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, two minutes to go, Ken.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Man, this tracking's so much fun, let's do it all over again.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 14 Young (LM):</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 15 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] pretty.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 16 Young (LM):</b> First time you ever got a set that worked, huh?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 17 Mattingly:</b> Yeah (laughter).</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 18 Young (LM):</b> (Laughter)</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 19 Mattingly:</b> I haven't had a red light now in so long, I don't know what it means.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 20 Young (LM):</b> Yeah. You know, these optics are beautiful. This AOT in here is just like - just fantastic.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 36 Mattingly:</b> Good. I'd never believe that this [garble] could be so nice.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 38 Young (LM):</b> Yeah. What time's AOS? I never asked.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 45 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) I never did, either.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 47 Duke (LM):</b> We get rendezvoused before we get AOS.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 48 Young (LM):</b> Do we?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 49 Duke (LM):</b> Yeah. We're not docked, but we're rendezvoused.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 50 Young (LM):</b> Hopefully.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 51 Mattingly:</b> [Garble], or did they scrub that?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 54 Young (LM):</b> They didn't say scrub it. I'm going to take them until they say scrub it. Nobody told me.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 51 58 Duke (LM):</b> We got the film.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 00 Mattingly:</b> All righty.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 02 Duke (LM):</b> I saved you some on this roll. It's ...</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay, how about taking a good look at that dude right up - right up there on top of that [garble].</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 10 Young (LM):</b> Okay. And I'll tell you what we'll do, Ken. We'll - When we come to dock, we'll go to the docking attitude. Once we get lined up, go to the docking attitude, and I'll try to maneuver in to where it's - All you got to do is translate forward. Would that be all right? Save you some RCS?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 26 Mattingly:</b> Well, at this point, the RCS isn't that [garble].</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 30 Young (LM):</b> Okay - okay, well, however ...</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 34 Mattingly:</b> [Garble]</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 35 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, but, you know, RCS is midcourse fuel.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 39 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 42 Young (LM):</b> And this thing has got a barrelful of it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 44 Duke (LM):</b> Okay; 20 seconds, Ken.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 52 59 Duke (LM):</b> You bas - you crummy thing.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 00 Young (LM onboard):</b> What did it do?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 05 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Pro. I thought I had a stuck key, but it came out.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 12 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay, did you get that Pro, Ken?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 16 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 32 Young (LM onboard):</b> Well, I don't know. The last one was so good, I might as well do this one, too.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 34 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 35 Mattingly:</b> I've got plus 0.5, minus 0.5 and plus 2.2.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 37 Young (LM onboard):</b> Oh, yeah?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 39 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay, we'll burn this.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 44 Duke (LM onboard):</b> We're going to burn plus 0.5, plus 0.2, plus 0.7.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 53 48 Mattingly:</b> All righty.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 11 Duke (LM onboard):</b> 90 degrees at 26.5. We're coming right in there, John. Perfect. You want a lunar rock as a souvenir? They'd never miss it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 17 Young (LM onboard):</b> I'll give it to Ken. No, I don't - I don't know what to do with it at this point. Oh, first igneous rock I've seen.
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 24 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Man, we've got some nice crystalline rocks.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 26 Young (LM onboard):</b> Hope so. Here we go, Charlie.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 27 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 32 Young (LM onboard):</b> And he said 29 foot a second on the braking, which sounds about right. What'd it say?</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 36 Duke (LM onboard):</b> PGNS said 27.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 39 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay, we'll take it.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 40 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Ground said 29.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>176 54 49 Mattingly:</b> Well, in case you don't have enough [garble], I'll give you [garble].</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>177 19 52 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Oh. Well, I got a peek at the SIM bay as we came up under it; clean.</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>177 20 20 Duke (LM):</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 20 21 Mattingly:</b> The one on my - the most- plus-Y one is the Mass Spec - It's got a white cover and it - it's kind of a rectangular shape cover. The one on the left or - it's really in about the center of the SIM bay - at the aft end and it has a silver cover and that's the Gamma Ray. Would you take a look and see if either of the covers are not quite closed because we have indications in the spacecraft that they're not closed and indications on the ground that they are.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 21 31 Mattingly:</b> Got about 20 degrees of pitch and about 30 degrees of roll.

        <p class="tech"><b>177 21 45 Mattingly:</b> Now then, I wait for you to take a look. And then, after you do that, why, I will do a 360-degree rotation about my X-axis while you take pictures of the thermal coating.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>177 21 57 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, I can see around the - the thrusters now that it's blistered and peeled. They want Om - they want ...</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>177 22 25 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, Ken, at the aft end, down next to the engine bell, there's a black cover that appears to be partially opened.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 22 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay, because the inconel shield on the Mass Spec is - black. Okay, do you see the Gamma Ray door?</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>177 24 45 Young (LM onboard):</b> Here's a door that's not closed there back there in the back end.</p>
        <p class="oblm"><b>177 2h h8 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, that's what I said. Yeah, that's the one - Okay, you - The - the mass - the Gamma Ray door is partially open, Ken.</p>

        <p class="oblm"><b>177 26 44 Duke (LM onboard):</b> No, that's fine, John. I don't believe I could get it all in the field of view if you were any closer.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 46 09 Duke:</b> Yeah, I got it. I know which one.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 46 12 Irwin:</b> Okay, if you've got that, I'm doing a Step 5 - it's delete first two lines. Over.</p>

And then go to 3-10 for the CBs on Contingency Checklist.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 48 11 Irwin:</b> Okay. Then on page 14, step 11, delete "PPKs, three, on the left-hand midsection and the aft SRCs." That's in parentheses. The next item is the flag kit. Next item is flight data file. Then add Timeline Book and LM Contingency Checklist. Over. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 48 56 Duke:</b> Okay. Scratch PPKs, the flag kit, the flight data file, and add the Timeline Book and the Contingency Checklist.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 52 02 Duke:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 52 04 Irwin:</b> Okay, on the right-hand side of that page, we want to delete, essentially, three blocks there; the "MSFN up-link/update," all the steps under that - the five steps; then the next, "target PGNS"; and then "Configure AGS." All that portion is to be deleted.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 52 23 Duke:</b> Yeah. I got you. Go ahead. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 52 29 Irwin:</b> Okay, under "Configure AGS," all those AGS - the four AGS entries there are - are deleted. We pick up there with Step 2.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 52 40 Irwin:</b> Okay, then the - the following are changes in the LM Contingency Checklist on page 3-9. Step 4, add "Verify" - Do you want me to wait until you get to the Contingency Checklist, Charlie?</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 53 12 Irwin:</b> Starting at Page 3-9.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 54 38 Young:</b> Hey; Jim, I - I - I guess I think that to verify the Master Arm, Off, is kind of a silly change to make Charlie copy, if you got 25 pages of that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 54 50 Irwin:</b> No, listen, John; we've just about one more page, and we'll be finished.</p>

Then Step 5, delete three lines and add "Connect LM/CM umbilicals." Over.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 56 32 12 Duke:</b> Okay, what was that last one?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 56 35 Irwin:</b> The last one was Step 5 to delete three lines and and "Connect LM/CM umbilicals." Over.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>177 59 10 Duke:</b> Okay, what's the plan, Jim? Just to power this moose down, and then come back in tomorrow and fire it up again for jettison?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 59 22 Irwin:</b> That's affirmative, Charlie, and will you get the AGS Mode Control, Off?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 59 34 Duke:</b> It's Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>177 59 35 Irwin:</b> And, Orion, if you'd like, I'll go through the - the basic plan here, post-docking, so it's - be clear in your minds. The first step, of course, is to doff suits in the LM, and, of course, we're going to postpone some of the LM transfer until after you wake up. We're powering down the LM, and we are going to - we're drying out the water boiler. And we'll be ready to close out the LM at - at 179:20. That's AOS plus 10 minutes on this next pass. And then Step 5 is - we'll - y'all will get in the LM tomorrow and complete the transfer and LM jettison, and you will need the LM Timeline Book and the LM Contingency Checklist at docking to accomplish the deactivation.

        <p class="obcm"><b>180 27 03 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay. John, what I was gonna suggest is, we just crumple this thing up athwartship here. Is that all right? Instead of putting it in the bag? Because we just got to get it out tomorrow morning, sometime.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 97 33 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> What? About 45.</p>

        <p class="obcm"><b>180 27 41 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> No, 180 something. 180 - 180:40.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 28 04 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> I doubt it. Not when you consider the fact that we got to get - how many hours it's gonna take to get suited up and jettison the LM tomorrow. It's gonna take all day to do that. Well, what do you got to do now?</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 28 23 Young (CM onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 28 24 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Yeah. Let's close up, get some chow, and - Yeah. Yeah, but - let's get that tomorrow.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 28 48 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> You - Well - Don't hang the DeBakey [?] [probably dohicky] against the switch panel. Oh, that's what it was. That thing.

        <p class="obcm"><b>180 29 39 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> I'd suggest, if anybody's got to defecate, that you go over to the LM to do it.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 30 26 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> They get tired. But they're fresh. (Laughter)</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 30 52 Young (CM onboard):</b> [Garble]</p>

        <p class="obcm"><b>180 3105 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Charlie, if you got to defecate or something, I'd suggest you use the LM. Yeah.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 31 14 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Well, that's a change. Last time, they let them oversleep.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 31 32 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Well, that - that's the name of the game right now. I don't understand it, but that's the way it is. I - I guess I'll just learn to accept that.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 31 50 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Looks like those straps on your - on your right shoulder there are catching, Charlie.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 32 32 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Are you gonna scare me again?</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 32 45 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Yeah. You get - you get colder. Yeah. Okay. Now, babe - for the time being, why don't you lay in my couch here for a minute.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 33 16 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay, John, just - don't - (laughter)</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 33 23 Young (CM onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 33 25 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> (Laughter) I never would have guessed.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 33 37 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Huh? Well, I thought we had - thought we had just made our first lunar abort. Yeah. Ever since then, I've had this terrible feeling that maybe they should have aborted us. (Laughter)</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 35 14 Young (CM onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 35 28 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> I got the distinct impression they weren't very happy with our questioning. Well, I thought the thing to do was do nothing. You know? Because then if they decide to go, we're probably still not that - we're within phasing capability. If they decided not to go, then we could afford to use the gas. The thing I couldn't see was why we were still questioning and pressing on, and wasting all that gas to accomplish nothing. Now that one really puz - that - On the first rev, that was okay. That would have cost me maybe 50 pounds. Oh, yeah. Well, we almost were. And that's the reason I asked you, "Should I tag up?" And you said, "No." Well, I didn't either. And- no, I - I was just saying, you know, I ...</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 36 23 Young (CM onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 36 28 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> You got to phase it.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 36 42 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Yeah, but I just didn't like the idea of doing it the expensive way. Brute force is never the way to do anything in a marshmallow. Are you looking for a place to stow that, Charlie? Oh, okay. Yeah. I was gonna say - Hey, there's a - plenty of room down here.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 37 35 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> (Laughter) No. I tell you what, for a temporary thing for tonight - down in the bottom of John's TSB over there, I put in those - those two - plastic over - urine overwrap bags; let's use them tonight, and I'll start on the other g - other jettison bag after we get rid of the LM.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 37 54 Duke (CM onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 38 10 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Well, how big a bag do you need for that?</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 38 12 Duke (CM onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>180 38 20 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> The DEDA? Did you say the DEDA? Oh. I was gonna say - I wouldn't mind having your platform, but I really don't care about having your - (laughter) Go ahead. Well, here's one we can certainly afford to throw away. That's the most worthless piece of junk. Yeah, it does spin, but that's all it does.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>181 09 28 Mattingly:</b> Hey, man. We really appreciate the stuff they've been doing for us, I'll tell you. We're gonna have to get a thing going at the - at the place down there when we get back.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 09 40 England:</b> Roger. Everybody - everybody agreed with that in a here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 09 53 England:</b> He calls it a happening.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 10 15 England:</b> Okay. And, John, could you go Accept, please?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 11 58 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 11 59 England:</b> Go, Charlie</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 12 04 Duke:</b> Hey, Tony, now about a few words on what the general plan is for tomorrow?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 12 10 England:</b> Okay; stand by one, and I'll get them ready.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 13 08 England:</b> Okay, Apollo 16. For tomorrow, we'll give you a Flight Plan update in the morning, but just a resum� here. We'll have you wake up at 189:30. That'll give you a good night's sleep, there. And we'll transfer back over the LM and get the rest of the gear back over and activate the LM. Come back to the Command Module and don the suits, and jettison the LM, and jettison the satellite. And towards the end of the day, we'll do a TEI. We've got a plan for using the Mapping Camera and Altimeter most of the - I think it's most of the day. And we have some Pan Camera passes also. We'll get the details on that up tomorrow.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 14 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we're not going home with any blank film, are we, Tony?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 14 26 England:</b> Okay, Ken. All the Pan [Camera film] will be used up, but it looks like we'll have several hundred feet of the Mapping Camera [film].</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 14 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 15 10 Young:</b> Well, one thing about it, Tony with one suit on and one suit off a day, if - you don't have to worry about your exercise periods.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 15 20 England:</b> You're not going to wear out the ropes tomorrow, huh?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 15 32 Young:</b> Doing the suit donning and doffing is the equivalent of wearing out a set of ropes.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 15 37 England:</b> I believe it. You guys will be all set for a Houdini act.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 15 45 Duke:</b> Hey, Tony, did - Tony, did you say we get up at 8 - 189:30?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 15 54 England:</b> That's affirmative, it's 181:27.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 16 01 Duke:</b> That's amazing. That's what I was just looking at.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 16 08 England:</b> Don't you think you can sleep that long? Golly, I'd think you'd sleep 12 hours.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 16 21 England:</b> And y'all have an estimate on when you'd be ready to go to bed?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 Id 35 Duke:</b> Probably - I - we just started eating.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 16 39 England:</b> Okay. And you can go back to Block, and your EMP is running.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 17 07 England:</b> And our plan here is - once you get to bed, we'll do all we can to not disturb you until it's necessary to meet the schedule for tomorrow.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 17 25 Young:</b> Which is 189:30, right?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 17 30 England:</b> We may have to ...</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 17 31 Young:</b> If we stay up all night, tomorrow morning we're gonna be awake at 189:30.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 17 36 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 17 43 England:</b> There's some slop in that, John. We may be able to even slide that some.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 17 56 Young:</b> I'd just as soon get up a couple of hours earlier and use the Mapping Camera film.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 18 09 England:</b> You're really socking it to us here</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 19 23 England:</b> I wonder if you could give us an estimate on how much time you're going to need in the LM tomorrow before you get to the LM activation.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 19 42 Young:</b> Around 30 minutes would probably do it, Tony.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 19 46 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 20 24 Young:</b> [Garble] tomorrow, this [garble].</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 21 30 England:</b> Incidentally, John, you got three dots from the Cape.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 21 39 Young:</b> Now you're talking.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 22 24 Crew:</b> (Laughter)</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 22 32 England:</b> Apollo 16, somebody may be on VOX, there. Every once in a while, we have you keying down here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 23 58 Duke:</b> Thank you, Tony. We appreciate it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 24 23 England:</b> And, Apollo 16, we were a little late on acquisition, there. We'd like you to verify that your High Gains's set up on zero Pitch and Yaw 170.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 24 39 Mattingly:</b> That's where she is. We saw you with a low signal strength, and -</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 24 50 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 24 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay, but we're - we're in Auto instead of React [sic].</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 24 58 England:</b> Okay. Understand.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 25 01 Mattingly:</b> Which accounts for it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 32 07 England:</b> Okay, Apollo 16, if you have a chance, there, we'd like an E-Mod.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 32 19 Mattingly:</b> On the way.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 32 21 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 35 14 England:</b> And, Apollo 16, we've got all we need for the night. Why don't you press on through there and then, your pre-sleep, just record the read-outs. Don't bother sending them down, and we won't bother you anymore. Just hit the sack. See you in the morning.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>181 35 4l Mattingly:</b> Roger. As the Sun sinks slowly in the west, we bid a fond farewell to all MCC.</p>

Orbit is now measuring 54.8 by 66.1 nautical miles. Another hour and five minutes remaining on this front-side pass before the spacecraft goes around the corner to begin revolution 57. Revolution count starts at 180 degrees longitude, which is directly opposite the Earth's side of the Moon. Orbital weight at the present time is 43,856 pounds, a little more than 21 tons. Six hours and 16 minutes remaining in the sleep period until the crew is awakened for a rather busy day. Meanwhile, here at the Control Center, the Gold Team, those who aren't busy with planning for the subsequent days' activities, are watching a rerun of the EVA-3 video tape. At 183:14, this is Apollo Control.</p>

        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 186 hours, 12 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; some four minutes away from Loss Of Signal as the sleeping crew or Apollo 16 nears the end of their 57th lunar orbit. That orbit at the present time measuring 54.5 by 66.2 nautical miles. Cabin pressure during this pass holding 5.3 pounds per square inch at a temperature of 72 degrees. All three crewmen apparently fairly sound asleep at this time. They have some 3 hours, 16 minutes remaining before reveille call. And then a rather busy day continuing to close out the Lunar Module, [and] prepare it for its de-orbit and impact manoeuvre, jettisoning the Ascent Stage, jettisoning of the sub-satellite to be left in lunar orbit and then the Trans Earth Injection burn late in the day, propelling the Command Service Module onto [an] Earthward track. At 186:14 this is Apollo Control.</p>

By medical data on the Command Module pilot Ken Mattingly and Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke being received, mean heart rates running in the 40's for both men. Cabin temperature in the Command Module showing 68 degrees. Cabin pressure, 5.2 pounds per square inch. New Flight Plan update is out up through the end of Trans Earth Injection. Stand by please. Flight Plan update had been published up through beyond Trans Earth Injection. There will be a GET update, that is the Ground Elapsed Time will be forced to agree with [the] pre-flight plan. At 191 hours Ground Elapsed Time will suddenly become 212 hours 48 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, for a change of 21 hours, 48 minutes. In other words, [time] during revolution 76 of the pre-flight plan will agree with the real time Revolution 65. I trust everyone is sufficiently confused!
