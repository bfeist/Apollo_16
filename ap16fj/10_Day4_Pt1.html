We now show Apollo 16 at 19,304 nautical miles [35,751 kilometres] away from the Moon, and now traveling at a speed of 3,643 feet [1,110 metres] per second. Although we've had no conversations with them, our data here in Mission Control indicates the crew is awake - waking up on their own. We will stand by, with the air-to-ground line up, to pick up the conversations between the crew of Apollo 16 and CapCom Hank Hartsfield, should it [sic] occur. We're at 66 hours, 17 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; continuing to monitor the Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>066 17 32 Young:</b> Morning, Houston. How do you read? Over.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>066 17 34 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning, 16. How are you this morning?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>066 17 41 Young:</b> Pretty good there.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>066 27 33 Duke:</b> Okay, Houston. The LM/CM Delta-P is about one [pounds per square inch]. And, the cabin pressure being what it is, I guess that means that we really don't have any leakage up there much.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>066 27 54 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy one psi.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>066 28 07 Duke:</b> Psid, Hank.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>066 28 11 Hartsfield:</b> Stand corrected.</p>

Our displays now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 17,704 nautical miles [32,787 kilometres] from the Moon, and we show a speed of 3,676 feet [1,120 metres] per second]. We've had no further communication with the crew of Apollo 16 since that original greeting from spacecraft Commander John Young. But we will continue to monitor, and this is Apollo Control, Houston. </p>

    <p class="tech"><b>067 15 05 Mattingly:</b> Houston, how would you like to have a status report?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 15 10 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we're waiting. Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 15 16 Mattingly:</b> You're all 85-foot dishes, right? Ears, I mean.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 15 23 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. (Laughter)</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 15 31 Mattingly:</b> All right, Henry. We'll start here on A section. All 22041; Alpha 3, 6 and 1/2, outstanding; Alpha 4, none; Alpha 5, 27 and 5; Alpha 6, 7, 10, and 5. Bravo 1 - Bravo 1, 15039; Bravo 3, 5, good; Bravo 4, none; Bravo 5, 37, 25; Bravo 6, 5, and 5.

    <p class="tech"><b>067 17 41 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, was Charlie 6 just two entries, 5 and 7?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 17 48 Mattingly:</b> That's affirm. Okay, make that 5, 5, and 7.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 17 57 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 18 06 Mattingly:</b> And off the gourmet sheet [garble]</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 18 08 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken. We're coming up on an antenna switch and we'll lose comm for a few minutes.</p>
    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 67 hours, 18 minutes into the mission. What you just heard was Ken Mattingly passing along the crew's biomedical report following a convenience format using letters and numbers for speed in reporting. For example, A is the Commander, B is the Command Module Pilot and C is the Lunar Module Pilot. The six pieces of data reported on were radiation dosimeter readings, food, this is a negative report when the crew member followed the planned menu, amount of sleep, medication, urine, and water consumed. At 67 hours, 19 minutes we show Apollo 16 at 17,033 nautical miles [31,545 kilometres] away from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 3,691 feet [1,125 metres] per second].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 20 10 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston.</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>067 20 52 Young:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 20 55 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We're so far - You're so far out now that when we get close to antenna switching, we lose comm there for about a minute, a minute and a half. We're ready to copy the menu now; food.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 21 14 Young:</b> Okay, our menu reporter is stealing a cup of coffee. He'll be with you in a second.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 21 21 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And the surgeon compliments the reporter on the way he reads the report down. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 21 39 Young:</b> Yeah, when you've got a college education, you learn to read, and boy anything can happen after that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 21 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Henry. The happy gourmet says that for the Commander - Well, we'll start with meal A. And, stand by one.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 23 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay, on the Commander, you can delete the grits. On Meal B, we - we skipped the Skylab meal as Meal B and then ate it as Meal C. And on that, we skipped the peanuts. And for the second meal on the day, John had a grapefruit drink, bread with peanut butter, and - I guess that's it. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 23 54 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 24 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay. On mine, you can start on Meal A. Scratch the peaches, the scrambled eggs, four bacon squares, grits. My Meal B: I had the bread and peanut butter and the grapefruit drink. On the Skylab meal, I had one of the two rye breads and - out of all this chicken spread, no one ate a third of it, that's - we probably ate a tenth of it apiece. And for Charlie, he's been good. He eats everything. None of us ate the peanuts on the Skylab meal. And for the second meal of the day, Charlie had an orange-pineapple drink with potassium, and peanut butter. And you'll be happy to know that we shared our peaches with Casper. He ate just about as much of them as we did.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 25 18 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. That sounds kind of like it didn't work out too well.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 25 26 Young:</b> There's a lot of peach still on Casper's face, I'll tell you that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 25 34 Duke:</b> Hank, when you open that can, you get them all at once.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 25 42 Hartsfield:</b> Charlie, you're going to have to work on those guys about the grits.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 25 48 Duke:</b> Grits are good. I can't get them to eat them, though. They - I sur - ate part of John's.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 26 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. And maybe I missed it here, somewhere, but could you give us some words on what you plan to do about Midcourse 4?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 26 12 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. No Midcourse 4. And, I got a couple items of news here, if you're interested in that. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 26 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Is that general interest news, or like how we handle our relay setting and so forth?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 26 32 Hartsfield:</b> Oh, it's just general interest stuff on - We're coming up on antenna switching.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 26 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we'll catch you after that.</p>
    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston, 67 hours, 27 minutes into the mission. As you heard the crew of Apollo 16 sounds fresh and ready this morning. The principal spokesman for the crew thus far has been Ken Mattingly who provided the status reports. We show Apollo 16 at 16,736 nautical miles [30,995 kilometres] away from the Moon. We now show the velocity of Apollo 16 at 3,699 feet [1,127 metres] per second. At 67 hours, 28 minutes continuing to monitor this is Apollo Control, Houston. </p>

    <p class="tech"><b>067 29 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Henry. How about if we stop PTC right here at this 144-degree pass?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 30 14 Mattingly:</b> Henry, did you copy that?</p> <a name="067_30_17"></a>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 30 17 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copied. And we got some Flight Plan updates for you, and you can stop it now if you like.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 30 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 30 39 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, repeat no MCC-4 is required, and for your information, the data there for the UV photos is good for an hour after the Flight Plan time. So there's no real rush on that one. if you're ready to copy, we'll just charge right into these Flight Plan changes. The first one is at 70 hours and [garble].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 30 59 Young:</b> Okay, go.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 31 00 Hartsfield:</b> 70 hours and 40 minutes. We want to write in there, "Charge Bat A," and that's, for your information, for about three hours and 20 minutes.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 31 22 Young:</b> Okay. At 70:40 we'll charge Battery A, and that's roughly going to be in three and a half hours.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 31 29 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And at 71:20, we want to enter, "Load DAP with the weights and gimbal trim from MSFN, and call EMP 509."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 32 03 Young:</b> Okay. At 71:20, we'll load the DAP with MSFN weight and gimbals and call EMP 509.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 32 11 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. The next thing occurs at 73:55, at the sextant star check. Want to add, in parentheses, "No Verb 41. Manually - manual only with Verb 16 Noun 91."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 32 45 Young:</b> Okay. I've got at 73:55, at the sextant star check, we'll do no Verb 41 and we'll do it manual with 16 91 as our check.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 32 59 Hartsfield:</b> That is affirmative. And EECOM advises you can [garble].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 33 02 Young:</b> While we're on that, Henry - while we're on that one, Henry, I didn't see where we terminated 509. Do we keep it running all this time?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 33 14 Hartsfield:</b> That is affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 33 20 Young:</b> Thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 33 24 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. And EECOM advises you can go ahead and start that battery charge now, if you want to get Charlie started on that. And, next thing occurs at 74:08. And there we do the "Do SPS cue card through gimbal drive." </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 34 01 Young:</b> Okay, that's at 74:08. It's SPS cue card through gimbal drive.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 34 08 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And LOS - MSFN LOS time will be 74:18.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 34 18 Young:</b> Okay, 74:18 is LOS.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 34 26 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, that's the Flight Plan changes. I have some notes now. I don't know where's the best place to copy these. I've got about nine or ten of them here. Well, take it back. I got two notes on the use of EMP 509, and they read as follows. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 34 46 Young:</b> Okay, let me get my scratch pad out and I'll copy those first.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 35 15 Young:</b> Okay, Henry. I'm ready to copy your notes.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 35 20 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Number one: the TVC DAP is unstable with EMP 509.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 35 48 Young:</b> Okay, understand. The TVC DAP is unstable with 509 running.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 35 53 Hartsfield:</b> That is affirmative. And number two is, "At SPS cutoff plus 2.5 seconds, the TVC enable is de-energized." The EMP is off; thus, the platform alignment could be lost.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 36 27 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 36 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, and I have some Flight Plan changes now that are concerned with DOI. The first one occurs at seven [garble].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 36 42 Young:</b> Stand by a second.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 36 43 Hartsfield:</b> All right.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 37 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Henry. I'm ready. These are comments, or these are things to go into the Flight Plan?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 37 38 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. These are Flight Plan changes, Ken. I'm sorry I didn't get this in order a while ago. It was buried in the bottom here.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 37 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 37 50 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, at 77:57, there's a group of CSM systems checks. Move those up to 77:20.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 38 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we take the CSM systems checks and move them from 77:58 over to 77:20.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 38 31 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. Now at 77:50, "Verb 48 21101 01111.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 39 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. At 77:50, that's "Verb 48 into 21101 01111."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 39 09 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative, and immediately following that, "Start EMP 509."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 39 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Henry. I guess I don't quite understand the loading the - the Verb 48 into 21101, and then the next thing we do is to load a three in there. Could you have someone give me some rationale on that?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 39 55 Hartsfield:</b> The difference there, Ken, is you - when you're loading that Verb 48 for the - the EMP 509, you don't Pro on that one and activate that DAP. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 40 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I see what you're saying. All right. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 40 13 Hartsfield:</b> In other words, we have to get the right DAP in there before we do the EMP 509. The next item is the activities that are located between 78:03 and 78:08, we want to move back to just following the P52 at 77:53. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 40 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay. How about giving me the first line and last line on the block you're talking about.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 40 48 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, that's "P30, verify DOI T<sub>IG</sub> and Delta-V<sub>s</sub>" through "Acquire MSFN Omni D." Move all of that back to just following the P52, or "landing site orient" at 77:53. And in that group of activities, we want to delete that Verb 48. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 41 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay, now what I have is - have you got any more changes to this area, and then I'll read you what I have sequentially.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 41 47 Hartsfield:</b> There's nothing more on that particular page, 77 through 78 hours.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 42 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Maybe I missed something here, but I have - I have not seen us - terminate 509. I'm sure we did somewhere before the LOI burn...</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 42 18 Hartsfield:</b> Uh [garble].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 42 19 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] and we'll do it again.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 42 20 Hartsfield:</b> We're going to get to do - in that Ken, we're going to have that on your cue card. I've got cue card change coming up for you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 42 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay. All right, let me give you what I have here and then - At 77:20, I do all the CSM systems checklist items that are listed now at 77:58. At 77:50, we do a Verb 48 21101 01111. We start EMP 509. Then, at about 77:55, we do all the steps which are presently listed at 78:03 down through 78:08.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 43 08 Hartsfield:</b> And that's with the exception of the Verb 48.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 43 13 Mattingly:</b> That's right; with the exception of Verb 48.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 43 19 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, that's all correct. Now, the next item is, at 78:22, we delete the sextant star check and move it back to 78:15. And it carries the same warning as we had before. No Verb 41, manual only with the Verb 16 Noun 91.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 43 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's a sextant star check at 78:15 with no Verb 41, doing it manually and deleting the star check at 78:22.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 44 04 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And the last item for this is, at 78:18 add "do SPS cue card through gimbal drive."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 44 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay; that is at 78:18, it's "Do SPS cue card through gimbal drive."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 44 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And the cue card that you'll use is the same for LOI and DOI. We're going to read you those changes.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 44 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p> <a name="067_45_34"></a>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 45 34 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. I have your SPS burn card changes whenever you're ready to copy.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 45 43 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 45 51 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Just as a note here for yourself. You load the DAP before starting the card, and you do not change Verb 48 after starting EMP 509. Now, we tried to indicate that in the Flight Plan, and I explained that to you while ago. Okay, first step: at the top of the card, the very first item, add "EMP 509 called."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 46 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay, at the very top of the card, it's "EMP 509 is called."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 46 37 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And down at the fifth item, where it says "Load DAP," delete that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 46 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we'll delete "Load DAP."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 46 52 Hartsfield:</b> Where it says "Boresight &amp; sextant star check," delete the "Verb 41 Noun 91 Enter," and make the comment: "No Verb 41, manual only with Verb 16 Noun 91."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 47 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we delete "Verb 41 Noun 91," and we say "No Verb 41, manual Verb 16 Noun 91." </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 47 27 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. At the left of the card opposite "Main bus ties," where it says "54 minutes,'' change that to "40 minutes," and in parentheses "Minus 20 minutes."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 47 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we've changed "54 minutes" to "40 minutes," and "Minus 6" to "Minus 20."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 48 03 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And down a little further where it says "55 and 5," we want to change that to "41 and minus 19."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 48 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We've changed "55" to "41" and "minus 5" to "minus 19."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 48 31 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, on the back side of the card - Let me read you the whole thing we want to get in there, Ken, so you'll know how to squeeze it. Right after it says "Accept parentheses Pro," we want to get in there, "If glitch occurs, use RHC to stop maneuver Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter, Verb 40 Enter, Verb 62 Enter. Manual maneuver to attitude," so you have to kind of squeeze that in there a little bit. I'll read it to you slowly now. "if glitch occurs [garble].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 49 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay, stand by a minute.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 49 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay, go ahead, Hank.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 49 46 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. "If glitch occurs, use RHC to stop maneuver. Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter. Verb 40 Enter. Verb 62 Enter. Manual maneuver to attitude."</p>
    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control, Houston 67 hours 50 minutes into the mission. We're listening to CapCom Hank Hartsfield pass along flight plan updates to the crew of Apollo 16.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 50 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay, now, this says that - this is after the Pro on gimbal test, and we're saying that if we - you get one of these glitches, use the RHC to stop the rates. Would there be any objection to just switching to SCS while we do the rest of this, and that's my question. Now I'll read on. It's "Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter," and I have a question there, is that - I got the impression from what we were saying in our previous discussion that this wasn't restricted just to the middle gimbal; it's a possibility for - for the others. And then a "Verb 40 Enter," which will release the platform. Verb 62 will take us back. It's not - it's not clear to me, once we've put in Noun 20 as zero, that Verb 62 is a useful number. It seems to me that I must have skipped something here. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 51 54 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, I am a little puzzled about the Verb 62 needles. However, on the other item, the reason you only need a Verb 23 is that the - that zeros that CDU, which is the only one that locks you up in coarse align, and the others will reinitialize when we do the Verb 40.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 52 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I guess my question, though, is that, if it can happen in each of them, the only time you do the Verb 23 Noun 20 would be in the event that it did lock into the coarse align.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 52 36 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. GDO was just saying you cover all bets when you do this, and you don't have to stop and think about it.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 52 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay, but if you had moved off in yaw, it seems to me I would be possibly introducing more error -</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 53 33 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, would you - would you - state your concern again so we've got a clear picture of it. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 53 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay - maybe I'm off on a tangent. What it looked to me like is that if you pick up one of these glitches, I'm not sure that the rates are all going to be confined to just - just one axis by the time it stops, and if you then take and load Register 3 and Noun 20 to zeros, you may, in facts be at some other middle gimbal angle than zero. So, once you do that - I guess that - that has no effect if I do a Verb 40, huh? I guess that's the - I missed that point. That merely gets me out of the coarse align, and...</p>
    <p class="ed">The next three entries in the Technical Transcript seem to fit the sequence of the conversation, but the timings given do not fit.]</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 53 26 Hartsfield:</b> That - that's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 53 27 Mattingly:</b> ...Verb 40 will be initialized. Is that correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 53 29 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. The Verb 40 starts the whole thing running again.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 54 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 54 33 Hartsfield:</b> The Verb 23 Noun 20 gets you out of the gimbal lock, if that's to be - if that's the case.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 54 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now I'm with you. Now I guess the only other thing is that, in the event that we have the thing we had - that happened the other night and it did coarse align there, it seems to me that, before I do the Verb 40, I would want to fly back on SCS to zero middle gimbal angle. Is that correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 55 02 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 55 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Okay, I think I understand that. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 55 23 Hartsfield:</b> The concern over using the SCS, Ken, was they were afraid you'd introduce a transient - another transient in there by the switching. However, if - you can't do - can't null it out with the RHC, you might be forced into SCS.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 55 45 Mattingly:</b> Well, we'll sure give it a try. It's just not - Perhaps once I just get the hand controller out of detent, that'll stop it at whatever new attitude it has, and that - that ought to hold it, so that there may be no further transients. I'll try that first.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 56 00 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Are you ready to go on with changes?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 56 05 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 56 07 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, out to the side there - a little arrow, I guess, is the best way to indicate it - in other words, between "Rate, High" and "EMS, Normal," we want to say "Terminate EMP 509."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 56 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay, when I terminate the EMP 509, you want me to write that between Rate, High and EMS to Normal? And it looks like the - I would do the Verb 48 back to my original values, but it looks like I would not be resetting the Average g flag. Or do you want that reset anyhow?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 57 16 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 57 32 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, the message is do a normal terminate as - as on the procedure they read up to you: and that's after you finish the gimbal drive test. That's what it's associated with. And following that - the next item - just prior to 59 minutes - I don't know how you're going to get all of this in there. You may have to write it to the bottom and show an arrow. "At minus 6 minutes, Tape Recorder High BIT Rate, Record, Forward, Command Reset."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 58 09 Mattingly:</b> And you did not want to do that at minus 20? Is that affirmative?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 58 15 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 58 21 Mattingly:</b> You want me to - to delete that from minus 20?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 58 24 Hartsfield:</b> Yes, I omitted that, Ken; I was going back to that. Back over here at minus 20, we want to delete - scratch through "Tape Recorder, High BIT Rate, Forward, Command Reset." And for your info, the reason we've given this 20 minutes is in both LOI and DOI, that gives us about ten minutes to watch what you're doing, watch the gimbal drive check, and if you need any help, we can give it to you from down here.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 58 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That sounds like a good plan.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 59 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You want the tape recorder, On, at minus six minutes.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 59 20 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 59 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>067 59 29 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Following 00:XX ECO, enter - right in there - "Be prepared for SCS takeover."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 00 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I got that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 00 33 Hartsfield:</b> You ready for the next one, Ken?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 00 38 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 00 40 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Right after "TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2, Off," we want to enter a little comment that says, "Prior to trimming Noun 85, Noun 20 should be checked against the IMU."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 01 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay, after "TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2, Off," and we'll put a note here that says, "Prior to trimming Noun 85, check Noun 20 against IMU," and that's because of reading the different angles of the FDAI pickoff.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 01 40 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 01 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 01 51 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Now I have changes for your SPS burn rules card.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 01 59 Mattingly:</b> Stand by. Let me read back what I got on here.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 02 07 Hartsfield:</b> Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 02 09 Mattingly:</b> On the SPS card, starting at the top with a note. Can you read me all right now, Hank?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 02 14 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 02 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay. At the top of the card, I've added a note that says, "No Verb 48 changes after entering 509. The first step on the card is "EMP 509 is called." I have deleted, "Load the DAP." Under the "Boresight sextant star check," I have deleted Verb 41 Noun 91. I have replaced that with a note that says "No Verb 41 and use manual, monitor 1691." I have changed the "Bus Tie, on" time from 54 minutes to 40 minutes, and that changes "minus 6" to "minus 20." I have deleted the tape recorder line at minus 6 minutes. I've changed the time 55 to be 41, minus 5 to be minus 19, and that's all the changes I have on the front side of the burn card. On the back side, next to the "Proceed after the gimbal test option": if the - if we get a glitch, it's "RHC to stop rates, Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter Enter, Verb 40 Enter, and then Verb 62 Enter, manually maneuver to attitude." After "Rate, High," and before 59 minutes, terminate EMP 509. At minus six minutes, "Tape Recorder goes to High BIT Rate, Record, Forward, and Command Reset." At 00:XX, at engine cut-off, it's "Be prepared for SCS takeover." At "TVC Servo Power, 1 and 2, Off," we've added a note, "Prior to trimming Noun 85, check Noun 20 against the IMU." And that's all the comments I have on the burn card.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 04 5B Hartsfield:</b> That's a good readback, Ken, and just to reiterate, that "Terminate EMP 509" is associated with terminating the gimbal test or ending up on that. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 05 07 Mattingly:</b> Roger. Any - I can do that any time after the gimbal test is completed.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 05 12 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 05 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 05 23 Hartsfield:</b> We would prefer that termination right after the gimbal check.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 05 30 Mattingly:</b> Yes sir. I don't want to get caught too late doing that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 05 34 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. This procedure, it'll handle no matter what glitch we get, and I understand that. But how about some discussion of the probability of getting such a glitch. Is there any - anybody thinking about that much, down there?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 06 02 Hartsfield:</b> I guess all of us have been thinking about it, John, but there's just no way we can predict whether it will happen again or not. Our gut feeling on the thing is that probably never see it again. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 06 21 Young:</b> Understand. It's very similar to the kind of thing that we had happen back in the early part of the Apollo Program with the CDUs that would make them count different. Is that not correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 06 39 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 06 46 Young:</b> Okay, thank you.</p> <a name="068_06_50"></a>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 06 50 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. Ready to copy the SPS burn rules update.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 06 55 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, the reason for these changes, Charlie, is after we watch MC-6 and look at the system pressures there, we got some new data; and, for your information, we're kind of predicting that your nominal values are going to be oxidizer 200, fuel 170, and - for your onboard readings. So based on that, we need to change these burn rules. And I believe you've already made one change to it, is that correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 07 27 Duke:</b> Yeah, but we got - I can scratch it in again somewhere else.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 07 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, on the Fuel Oxidizer press, where you put in 124 Oxidizer, you want to change that to 138 Oxidizer, and the Fuel goes from 110 to 112. In other words, instead of 124 Ox, 110 Fuel, we want 138 Ox, 112 Fuel.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 08 07 Duke:</b> Okay, copy. Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 08 09 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, for your Fuel Oxidizer Delta-P, the new rules are: "Oxidizer greater than fuel by 50" to "Oxidizer greater than Fuel by 12."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 08 36 Duke:</b> Now wait a minute, I had "50 Ox less than Fuel" last time.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 08 48 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, but - but what - what you had before, I think was 35 and 5. Is that correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 08 59 Duke:</b> Oh, okay. You're right, 35 and 5. Okay, go ahead again now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 09 03 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The new ones become "50 Oxidizer greater than Fuel" to "12 Oxidizer greater than Fuel." In other words, your 35 and 5 rules go to 50 and 12. Both of them, though "Oxidizer greater than Fuel." What we're changing is the 35 to 50, and we're changing the 5 to 12 and changing the sign over there, "Oxidizer greater" instead of "Oxidizer less."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 09 46 Duke:</b> Okay. What you are telling me, that's the limit; "50 - Oxidizer greater than Fuel" can be as high as 50 or as low as 12.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 09 56 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. 'Oxidizer greater than Fuel" in both cases, in other words, your range is oxidizer 12 to 50 psi greater them the Fuel pressure,</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 10 12 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, and on your tight limit [garble].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 10 14 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 10 15 Hartsfield:</b> [Garble] change the Oxidizer to "168 Oxidizer". What - what you have there is "168 Oxidizer, 153 Fuel." Want to change that to "183 Oxidizer, 153 Fuel"; no change in the Fuel.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 10 51 Duke:</b> Okay, copy tight limits: Oxidizer has to be greater than 183 and the Fuel greater than 153.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 10 59 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 11 26 Duke:</b> Okay, Hank. Let me give you an example here on this Delta-P<sub>s</sub>. Right now, I'm looking at about 170 Fuel and 195 Oxidizer. That says that I can go to - down to 150 - 140 on the Fuel side with a constant Oxidizer pressure before I reach my limit, or have the Fuel pressure increase up to 178 before I reach my limit. Is that correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 12 06 Hartsfield:</b> G&amp;C's checking. Let him look at it, Charlie.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 12 17 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 13 56 Hartsfield:</b> Charlie, that Fuel follows Delta-P of 50, Oxidizer follows Delta-P of 12. That was the answer I got back on that; however, on the example you gave, I thought you were right with it, except on the second part. It looked like to me you need a 12 difference there. I might of misread the thing. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 14 24 Duke:</b> Okay. I was just looking at my gages here, I've got about 190 Oxidizer pressure, and about 165 Fuel pressure. And so that says to me that the Fuel side could go up to 178 and I'd still be within the limit.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 14 48 Hartsfield:</b> That's what the rules say.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 14 54 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>068 15 02 Hartsfield:</b> The Oxidizer could drop to 177.</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>068 39 16 Peterson:</b> Yeah, it's looking real sweet.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 00 29 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 00 31 Peterson:</b> Go ahead, 16.</p> <a name="069_00_35"></a>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 00 35 Duke:</b> Okay, Pete, how about giving us a little recap on Midcourse-2 burn as far as what y'all saw as chamber pressures and interface pressures? And how did the old SPS look, versus the calibrations? </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 00 52 Peterson:</b> Roger. Stand by. We'll get it for you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 18 11 Peterson:</b> 16, Houston. I've got the figures on this burn that you wanted, and I guess I can start out by talking about the meter biases to make sure that we're clear on that. There's a 15-psi bias on the oxygen tank pressure. It's reading high. On top of that, there is a meter bias of eight psi, which is also high, so that our total bias on the oxygen onboard pressure reading is about 23 psi high - oxidizer, I'm sorry. And, on the fuel, it's seven low, total, which is a meter bias.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 19 03 Duke:</b> Okay, we understand.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 19 05 Peterson:</b> Okay. Then, with those numbers in mind, the chamber pressure during that burn was 100 psi, and the numbers that you should have read on board prior to the burn were oxidizer tank pressure 205 and fuel tank pressure 177. And, after the burn, the numbers you should have been reading were 197 oxidizer and 170 fuel. In other words, they both dropped - well, fuel - oxidizer dropped eight and fuel dropped seven psi during the burn. The interface pressures preburn were oxidizer 184 and fuel 187; and, during the burn, they were 168 oxidizer, 172 fuel. And, after the burn, the interfaces were oxidizer 174 and fuel 179. And all those look good to us.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 20 26 Mattingly:</b> Roger. We got you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 20 28 Peterson:</b> Okay, I don't know whether you noticed your pressures during the burn. It was a pretty short burn, but the oxidizer tank should have read about 205 and the fuel tank about 175, during the burn.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 20 43 Young:</b> Charlie was watching them.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 20 45 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 20 48 Duke:</b> Okay, Pete. During the burn, when the engine came on, the pressure started down.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 20 55 Peterson:</b> Roger. That's what - that's what should have happened. It was at 205 and 177 preburn and went to 197 and 170 postburn. That's oxidizer and fuel, respectively. And that's [garble].</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 21 12 Duke:</b> Okay, that's what we saw.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 21 13 Peterson:</b> Roger. And that - and our guys say that's - a - that's a - The figures look real good to them. That's the kind of performance they expected.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 21 28 Duke:</b> Okay, now for LOI. When the engine comes on, the helium valves open, and I can expect the pressures to rise and my gage reading for oxidizer to sit around 200 and, for fuel, to be around - 1 - 175?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 21 46 Peterson:</b> Around 1 - that's 200 on oxidizer and around 170 on fuel, Charlie.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 21 53 Duke:</b> Okay, fine.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 28 10 Mattingly:</b> Houston, Casper.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 28 13 Peterson:</b> Go ahead, Casper.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 28 18 Mattingly:</b> Could you have somebody put a few words together for me on what happens if the IMU gets coarse aligned while Average g is still on? I'm thinking about the - at the end of the burn.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 28 32 Peterson:</b> Okay, you - you're wondering about the situation when - if you get the glitch after the burn but while average g is still running?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 28 43 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. There's no chance of terminating Average g before that happens, and I'd kind of like to have some idea of what I might expect the - the navigation to do.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 28 55 Peterson:</b> Roger. We - we'll get you an answer on that, Ken.</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>069 31 08 Mattingly:</b> It's pretty - it's pretty loose now; it's in my pocket.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 31 11 Peterson:</b> If it's in your pocket, that might account for it.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 31 15 Mattingly:</b> I'm not ignoring your - yeah, I'm not ignoring it; I just haven't had a chance to stop and put them on yet. I'll get to it first chance I get. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>069 31 22 Peterson:</b> Roger. That's fine.</p>

    <p class="ob"><b>069 56 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> But you know what? I believe, just like the - you know, I think that the general attitude that we have seen, a one-in-a-million glitch, is probably quite correct.</p>

At the start of the first lunar revolution, with [the] Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver taking place shortly thereafter. The preliminary data passed up to the crew by the spacecraft communicator a short time ago. As the ignition time for the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn at 74 hours, 28 minutes, 25 seconds. This is subject to some refinement. Probably within a few seconds as we get down to the final maneuver information which will be passed up about, here comes a voice. </p>

    <p class="tech"><b>070 54 53 Peterson:</b> At 38 hours?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>070 54 58 Young:</b> That's affirmative. I woke up after the first night and I find this note in here from Ken. It says: 'John' - says - 'We have had some sort of IMU or CMC hardware problem. Right after you went to sleep at 38 hours, the platform coarse aligned itself; we got it back with an Earth/Sun alignment. Fortunately, MCC had high belt [sic] rate all the time and we'll work it out tomorrow. Sleep tight.' Signed, TK (laughter).

    <p class="tech"><b>070 55 37 Peterson:</b> Yeah, I - I guess we would concur with that funny sense of humor. We had some guys here laugh all night.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>070 55 50 Young:</b> Yeah, I (laughter) I guess I didn't believe the note (laughter).</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>070 58 52 Peterson:</b> Roger, Ken. We're doing that now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>070 59 13 Peterson:</b> 16, it looks like the SIM Bay temps are coming up a little. We may have to change our roll angle. We'll come up with an angle for you in just a minute.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>070 59 24 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>070 59 25 Peterson:</b> And the biomed - med data looks good now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>070 59 31 Mattingly:</b> All right, sir. And just as a curiosity item, you might note that it takes - with two of us working on putting those things on, it took us 15 minutes to put the data on and get hooked up. And I guess by yourself, it takes about 20 because you've got to use a mirror to see some of that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>070 59 49 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 00 16 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. We want you to go to a Roll of 020 with the same Pitch and Yaw angles that you have now. And you should be able to do the P52 in the new attitude, and the High Gain should stay locked up.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 00 34 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 01 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay, [garble].</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>071 06 18 Peterson:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 03 48 Mattingly:</b> Don, how about if we go ahead and do our P52s now?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 08 55 Peterson:</b> Okay. Go ahead, Ken.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 09 00 Mattingly:</b> All righty, thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 11 06 Peterson:</b> Casper, would you verify that you are gonna load the - the DAP and then the EMP 509 before you do the P52?.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 11 16 Mattingly:</b> That's in work right now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 11 19 Peterson:</b> Roger. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 11 29 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I guess you saw us get out of sequence there a little, but we're - we're back on now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 11 34 Peterson:</b> Roger. We understand.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 13 29 Peterson:</b> Casper, hold up on your procedure there a minute.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 13 35 Mattingly:</b> Okay; holding. You're pretty good. You stopped old Casper in midpunch.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 14 32 Peterson:</b> Casper, apparently it's necessary to load the normal DAP before you load the EMP, because once you've loaded the Saturn DAP, the LM weight and that sort of thing will not be accepted by the CMC. So we'd like to have you take the EMP out, load the normal DAP, and then load the EMP back in. We should of told you about that earlier, I guess. It slipped by.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 15 08 Mattingly:</b> Well, that's okay. I stopped and wondered about it, and then I decided I couldn't think of any reason why it wouldn't work the way we did it. Okay, we're back in sync now. Now we can start with 509. Is that affirmative?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 15 20 Peterson:</b> You've loaded the - the normal DAP now?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 15 29 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 15 33 Peterson:</b> Stand by just a minute. We're looking at it.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 15 45 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. It looks real good, and you can go ahead now with the EMP and the P52.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 15 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay, will do. I kind of like this attitude you picked, Don. It's got the old Earth in the telescope.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 16 02 Peterson:</b> Hey, wonderful ...</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 16 03 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] pretty.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 16 06 Peterson:</b> Plot board says you should be just about over Africa...</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 16 08 Mattingly:</b> ...[garble] picked this attitude for aesthetic reasons. Well, it's orange. I guess that - that's sort of saying something.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 16 20 Peterson:</b> Right.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 18 10 Mattingly:</b> Don, would you ask the guidance guys to take a look at [garble] I'm sure it's a typical thing, I just never noticed. I was watching the optics zero the other night, and using 1691 as the way to do that. And here again I - I watched it, and at the completion of the zero, it looks like it went to - the Register 2 display now, and I'm still in zero. I just thought that was kind of curious. Is that a bit size or something?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 18 40 Peterson:</b> Stand by one. We'll look at it.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 18 56 Mattingly:</b> I've taken it out of Zero now. That's why it's counting. Then we'll go ahead with the 52.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 18 58 Peterson:</b> I understand you're taking it out of Zero now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 19 03 Mattingly:</b> It was out of Zero when it started counting. It went from 403 up to what you see now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 19 09 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 19 10 Mattingly:</b> And that's due to trunnion trip.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 19 15 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 22 23 Mattingly:</b> Don, is there any reason to torque these since we're getting ready to go to an option one?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 22 27 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 22 34 Peterson:</b> Go ahead and torque them. And, Ken, could you check your - your mike placement? You're very, very weak.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 22 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. Is that any better?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 23 01 Peterson:</b> Yes, that's some better, Ken. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 23 07 Mattingly:</b> And we'll torque them at 23:10.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 23 10 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 31 30 Mattingly:</b> Don, just out of more academic interest, it turns out that the pea [?] packs and the - and the Noun 91s are exactly the same.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 31 40 Peterson:</b> Roger; understand.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 32 10 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, Don, what I was gonna say is that the - the peapacks [?] on the shaft are within - yeah - the readability of the DSKY. The trunnion then seems to be off by about 2/100, which I think is a pretty fine agreement. And for the interest of some of those people who are talking about these optics and whether they drift or not, if you can watch 1691 right now, you'll find that I'm in - the Mode is Manual and I'm in Direct, and you can watch them drift slowly. And at low rate, I'll go to Resolve, and they drift at approximately the same rate. There seemed to be some question about that earlier. I thought - some of the guys in the back might be interested in that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 33 02 Peterson:</b> Roger. Copy. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 33 32 Peterson:</b> Okay, Casper, for your information, although we had you going ahead and load EMP 509 prior to the P52, it was not absolutely necessary at that point because you did this P52 under SCS control. And anytime you're under SCS control, that TVC relay is not enabled. So you really don't have the problem. There's no way that glitch can get to you. But we wanted - we had to have the EMP 509 loaded eventually, so we figured we'd go ahead and let you get it in now.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 34 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I understand that, and thank you very much.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 34 14 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 34 15 Mattingly:</b> And with all this stuff over the next few days, it wouldn't hurt to keep a list of those things down there and connect - and kind of stay with me on those things to be sure I don't get one of them out of sync.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 34 28 Peterson:</b> Roger. We'll follow you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 46 22 Peterson:</b> Casper, Houston. When you get a few minutes to talk, we've got a little philosophy - philosophy on the use of the EMP 509 in lunar orbit.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 46 48 Duke:</b> Okay, can you stand by just a minute, please?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 46 50 Peterson:</b> Roger. Will do.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 46 52 Duke:</b> Pete, we moved the eat period up a little bit. We're getting all the food ready here.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 46 58 Peterson:</b> Roger. This can stand by for quite a while.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 47 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll come back to you in about ten minutes with all that.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 47 09 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. Good enough; thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 54 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. I'm - I got some free hands now, and got my little note pad out, and I'm ready to listen and copy and discuss anything you got on this stuff.</p> <a name="071_54_31"></a>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 54 31 Peterson:</b> Okay. I guess, Ken, the first thing we'll talk about is the use of the EMP in lunar orbit, that is when you're - when you're alone in the spacecraft. We - we do not plan to run EMP 509 continuously, primarily because if you do, you don't have gimbal lock through gimbal lock protection. What we will do is we will run it during programs that involve TVC enable relay cycling, except for P52. Now, that means that we will run it for SPS burns, and you already have the procedures for LOI and DOI, and for other burns. The procedures will stay the same except that we may change the time sequences for doing some of the items. We will also run the EMP 509 for P24 and for rendezvous, and we're having MIT verify that compatibility at the present time. We'll come back to you on those with more details later. And during P52 with the P20 option 5, our current procedures call for going CMC, Free. Instead of doing that, what we'll do is we'll go to this Spacecraft Control, SCS; put the Rate switch High; and BMAG Mode, Rate 2. And that way, the rate damping level is below your orb rate, and so your SCS, as far as control is concerned, will be equivalent to CMC, Free. However, by going to SCS control, if you want to check back on that list of set and reset conditions, you'll find that by going to SCS control, we eliminate the possibility of getting this glitch.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 56 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay; would you say again how we're gonna handle P - nominally P20 option 5; we will not use 509. Is that correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 56 55 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. We will not use 509 during P20 option 5.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 57 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And when we come to do a P52, we will still not use the option - the 509 - we're gonna go to SCS control and use Rate High and Max Deadband. Is that correct?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 57 23 Peterson:</b> Okay; Rate High and Max Deadband is okay, but G&amp;C tells me you really - that the Deadband - you don't need to go to Max, it's - it's kind of immaterial which position you put the switch in. You do need the Rate switch in High, and you need BMAG Mode, Rate 2. That way you don't have an attitude control situation. You have a rate control situation, but the level is high enough that it's well above the orb rate, and so the SCS will be equivalent to going CMC, Free.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 58 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I understand that. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 58 03 Peterson:</b> Okeydoke; and...</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 58 04 Mattingly:</b> I'll leave it in Deadband and Rate, High. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 58 06 Peterson:</b> Roger. And we'll get more details to you later on the P24 and the rendezvous.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 58 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Doing good work.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 58 37 Peterson:</b> Ken, there's one other comment here. If you are gonna, at some point in lunar orbit, do quite a bit of Optics switching, like Manual and Automatic and that sort of thing, we would suggest in that case that you load EMP 509 before you start playing with the optics and take it out again when you're finished.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 58 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay; any time we're doing that - I assume that means like in - when we're doing the landmark tracking, both High and Low, and it's my understanding from the comments we got now that the only time 509 can get me in trouble is if I leave it enabled during thrusting.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 59 21 Peterson:</b> That in general is...</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>071 59 22 Mattingly:</b>...and also [garble] the automatic gimbal stop.</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>072 30 34 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 30 37 Peterson:</b> Okay. Map update, Rev 1. LOS: 074:17:41; 180 degrees: 074:31:39. AOS with LOI: 074:50:05; without LOI: 074:42:08.</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>072 31 25 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. Okay. Now, Ken, on this other question. As we understood your question, you're concerned about what happens after - at 2.5 seconds after the burn when you switch back to the RCS DAP and cycle this relay. What happens if you get the glitch, and it looks like there are two cases. Either you get a - a yaw glitch of sufficient magnitude to put you into coarse align, or you get some kind of glitch that could be in roll, pitch, or yaw but does not put you into coarse align. If you go into coarse align, the nav is no good, and the Noun 85s are no good, and in that case, we'd like you to exit Average g as soon as possible by - by exiting the program. If you're not in coarse align, the nav is good, but the Noun 85s are still no good.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 32 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Okay. We've got you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 32 42 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 32 45 Mattingly:</b> Particularly in LOI, since there's no trim; that's only a problem for - for recording purposes anyhow. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 32 53 Peterson:</b> Roger. That's correct.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 32 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you very much.</p> <a name="072_39_32"></a>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 39 32 Peterson:</b> 16, Houston. I've get three items to go in the Flight Plan. At about 79:29 is the first one, and if we can get these in, that will finish up the Flight Plan updates for today.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 39 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Press on.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 39 51 Peterson:</b> Okay. At 79:29 right at the bottom of the page there, we want to add "Load 509," and at 79:3...</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>072 40 12 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. After. It should follow the "Load Noun 89."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 40 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I've added "Load 509" after "Load Noun 89."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 40 29 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. And at 79:38, we want to delete the Verb 48 there, and thats not associated with the 509. That's simply because that's redundant. You're already in that DAP configuration. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 40 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 40 53 Peterson:</b> And at - 79:42 right after the MSFN update block there, add "Terminate EMP 509 after P24 completed."</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 41 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay "Terminate 509 after P24 completed." Now let me - Is that the last one or you got some more?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 41 26 Peterson:</b> That's all of them.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 41 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let me read them back to you where I've got them to make sure I have it all right. At about 79:29-1/2 on the page, I've written "Load 509."

    <p class="tech"><b>072 44 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thanks.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 48 16 Peterson:</b> 16, Houston. We've got a couple more words on the LM paint-peeling problem. Apparently, it has been duplicated now in a vacuum chamber, and it does not appear to be any kind of a problem as far as the mission is concerned.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 48 37 Mattingly:</b> Well, that's fine to hear. Thank you now. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>072 48 40 Peterson:</b> Roger. It's nothing leaking; it's just the paint itself.</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>072 56 34 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>

    <p class="tech"><b>073 02 23 Young:</b> Houston, I just got my head unlocked and wiggled it out of window Number 1, and we have a half-Moon in Earthshine. It is really pretty.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 02 36 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 02 38 Young:</b> Got so many [garble] You can see all the - you know, you can see all the prominent features and little sharp craters like - I think I'm looking at Kepler. It's out there in the middle of the mare. It's just beautiful. And that's all Earthshine.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 02 53 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 02 56 Young:</b> Yes, and it's just about - it's like two-thirds of the window, if I've got my hand no more than 6 inches from it. You know, on the - on the dark side, you can see a big dark disk, and I think the reason I can see it is it's the solar corona that's illuminating around the back side. And I can see a star within - well, maybe it's within a degree of the Moon's disk.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 03 26 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 04 21 Peterson:</b> Could we get the Duke to confirm that that's really the Moon and not the Earth you're looking at?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 04 28 Duke:</b> Hey, babe, this is really the Moon. It's the most awe-inspiring sight I've ever seen in my life. Looks like the door that just hung out there in the middle of blackness. It's really beautiful, Pete.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 04 42 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 04 43 Mattingly:</b> And you can make out all the features on the thing. I can see [garble], and you can see up into the Procellarum - and in the basins in there. You can even see the outer rings of Orientale. And you can't see the basin itself but you can see it's outer rings.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 05 07 Peterson:</b> Sounds beautiful, Ken.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 05 13 Mattingly:</b> And looking at our present orientation, I can tell that our new attitude will be perfect for LOI.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 05 29 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 06 57 Peterson:</b> Ken, just for your information - The reading that you got when you zeroed the optics on the Noun 91s there was considered normal, and it's like a single-bit - or less than a single-bit error. And the other thing I wanted to pass on was that this. EMP 509 has been verified by MIT for use with P24 and during rendezvous.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 07 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>073 0T 50 Mattingly:</b> Don, we're gonna waste the two frames of VHBW. Could you tell me if it's better to - to use SS or TT?</p>
