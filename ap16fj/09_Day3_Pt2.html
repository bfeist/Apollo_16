      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 53 hours, 7 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We're having a change of shift here in the Mission Control Center. Pete Franks' team of flight controllers coming on relieving Jerry Griffin's Gold Team. There will be a change of shift briefing with the flight director, Jerry Griffin and the spacecraft communicator Hank Hartsfield in about 15 minutes in the news center briefing room. The crew at the present time is preparing to transfer into the Lunar Module for the activation and checkout transferring the pressure garments into the LM. And at 53:08 and still up live, this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 09 17 Duke:</b> Okay, Houston. The waste water dump is terminated at about 12 percent.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 09 23 England:</b> Okay, Charlie. We copy that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 09 38 Duke:</b> And, Tony, we're into the - equalizing the pressure CM/LM at this point.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 09 46 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 11 19 England:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 11 25 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 11 28 England:</b> When you're working up there in the hatch area, I've got a test for you on that Docking Latch 10. When it's convenient, you might let me know when you can work on it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 11 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Why don't we wait until the guys get into the LM, and then I'll work on that while they're doing that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 11 43 England:</b> Sounds good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 17 51 England:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. Omni Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 17 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p> <a name="053_28"></a>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 53 hours, 28 minutes. The LM televiewer - one of the Lunar Module flight controllers here in Mission Control - has just reported that from his telemetry data it looks as if the crew has opened the hatch preparing to enter the Lunar Module at this time. They're scheduled to spend about 50 minutes to an hour in the LM on housekeeping activities, in what will be the third entry into the Lunar Module Orion during the course of this mission. A change of shift press briefing is scheduled to begin shortly in the MSC news center briefing room. During the course of that briefing, we will tape record any conversations with the crew for playback immediately following the briefing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 28 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Houston. The Orion is on internal power at 53:28:34.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 28 56 England:</b> Okay. We copy that, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 30 58 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. We're in Orion now. You've got the comm on; you should be getting high bit rate momentarily.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 31 09 England:</b> Okay, and we'd like to go to the High Gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 31 17 Duke:</b> Okay. You mean over on Casper's side? Okay.</p>
      <p class="ob"><b>053 32 14 Duke (onboard):</b> That's signal strength for them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 32 22 Mattingly:</b> Houston. Okay. We just got the signal strength on Orion.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 32 33 England:</b> Okay. We have LM data.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 33 48 Duke:</b> Hey, Tony, ask TELMU about this 192 package lanyard. I looked at it yesterday, and I could see red and green. It's way out and looks okay to me. Is that copacetic?</p> <a name="053_34_03"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 34 03 England:</b> Okay. We'll find out. And, Charlie, we've got some changes to your Lunar Surface Checklist. Whenever it's convenient for you, we'll send them up to you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 35 01 England:</b> Charlie, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 35 03 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 35 06 England:</b> Okay. TELMU says that's okay; no problem.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 35 16 Duke:</b> That's fine, and what did you want to update? What checklist?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 35 19 England:</b> Okay, your Lunar Surface Checklist and your LM Cue Card for EVA prep.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 36 02 Duke:</b> Okay, Tony. I have the Cue Cards. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 36 06 England:</b> Okay. On the Cue Cards, it'll be all of them, EVA-1, -2, and -3; and I have one here for post- EVA. Okay. On the EVA-1, -2, and -3, after the sentence 'Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity to Houston,' we'd like to add the line...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 36 38 Duke:</b> Wait, wait a minute, wait; hold on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 36 42 England:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 36 44 Duke:</b> Okay. I've got EVA-1 prep; now which column?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 36 56 England:</b> Okay. It's on the left-hand column, right at the bottom line; it says "Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity to Houston."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 37 21 Duke:</b> Okay. I've got 'Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity to Houston'; the next one is a note, 'If Comm is No Go.' Is that the one you want?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 37 27 England:</b> Roger. We'd like to put a line in between "Read PLSS O<sub>2</sub> quantity" and the note.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 37 34 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 37 35 England:</b> Okay. 'Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease.'</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 38 06 Duke:</b> Okay. I got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 38 09 England:</b> Okay. And now on the EVA-2 prep Cue Card.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 38 17 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 38 21 England:</b> Okay. This is the left-hand column and this is - at the bottom, and we'll add the same line there, 'Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease.'</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 39 05 Duke:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 39 06 England:</b> Okay. On the EVA-3 prep, the same as EVA-2 prep.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 39 46 Duke:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 39 49 England:</b> Okay. Now this is on the post-EVA-3 Cue Card.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 40 00 Duke:</b> I got it. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 40 01 England:</b> Okay. On the third column, one-third of the way down, it says, 'Audio circuit breaker - Close.'</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 40 12 Duke:</b> Okay. Got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 40 14 England:</b> Okay. We'd like to add a line right after that. "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - noise threshold, plus 1-1/2."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 40 44 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 40 45 England:</b> Okay. The point of all of this is to increase the range of PLSS to LM, in case you're having a crew failure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 40 59 Duke:</b> What else you got?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 41 01 England:</b> Okay. It's the same sort of changes to your Lunar Surface Checklist, and I'll read them to you when you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 41 13 Duke:</b> Okay, Tony. We never use that checklist in this time frame. We'll copy it in, in a little bit, okay?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 41 20 England:</b> Okay. That's fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 42 55 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 42 58 England:</b> Go ahead, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 43 01 Duke:</b> Okay. I'm a little confused about your terminology, I guess. It says "Squelch VHF B (LMP) - full decrease." We only got one VHF B to squelch. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 43 11 England:</b> Roger; I understand that. The "LMP" was just a cue that you're the only one on the comm at the time, so you'll be the one to - to have to listen and get it down.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 43 24 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 44 10 England:</b> Charlie, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 44 14 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 44 16 England:</b> Okay. When you get a chance there, we would like you to read the ED Voltage, both A and B.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 44 43 Duke:</b> Exactly the same thing as yesterday, 37 volts, Tony, both of them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 44 47 England:</b> Okay. Good show, and verify Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 44 54 Duke:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 12 England:</b> Okay, Apollo 16. I guess that's all they need in the Lunar Module. At your convenience, you can power down. And could you read that tunnel index as you go through, the docking index?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 35 Duke:</b> Strange to say, it hasn't changed any. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 37 England:</b> All right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 39 Duke:</b> It's still minus three and a half.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 40 England:</b> Okay. We copy.</p> <a name="053_45_44"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 44 Duke:</b> You going to tell me something about this Latch 10, too?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 46 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 47 Duke:</b> Do you want us to do that now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 49 England:</b> Yeah, it'd be a good time, if you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 52 Duke:</b> I'm sitting here looking at it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 45 57 England:</b> Okay. On that docking latch Number 10, depress the yellow auxiliary release button, noting that the button will depress and whether it stays snapped in after being depressed. Now, the interest here is if the button will not depress, the latch mechanism is either stuck or broken. If the button stays snapped in, this indicates - or probably indicates that the latch was only partially cocked at launch...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 46 24 Duke:</b> [Garble]. It's in...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 46 26 England:</b> ...and stayed in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 46 29 Duke:</b> It's in, and it stayed in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 46 31 England:</b> Okay. Then, the indication there is that it was only partially cocked at launch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 46 40 Duke:</b> Well, do you want me to re-cock it and fire it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 46 42 England:</b> No, they had just as soon you leave it the way it is, because if it's broken, you may not be able to - to get it off again, and then that would foul up the undocking.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 46 54 Duke:</b> Sounds like a reasonable plan. Okay. I've got the Aux Release Button pushed in, and it stayed there, and the rest of it's gonna be left as is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 47 04 England:</b> Okay. Good show. That's it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 49 20 Duke:</b> Okay, Tony. We're going to get our suits on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 49 22 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 55 47 Mattingly:</b> And, Houston, we brought LM power back to the CSM at 53:49.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>053 56 14 England:</b> Okay, on the set in program P20, we read up previously that it wouldn't set in option 2. We've got a correction to that. It sets only in Options 0 and 4.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> At 54 hours during the change of shift briefing, John Young and Charlie Duke entered the Lunar Module, Orion. They powered it up check the communications system, completed their housekeeping activities aboard the LM and are in the process of returning to the Command Module. The total time from the time the LM was switched to its own power until they were back on the Command Module providing power to the Lunar Module was about 21 minutes. Again, as on the two previous occasions when we've had a look at the Lunar Module systems when the data has been transmitted back to Earth all systems on that vehicle look good. We'll play back the accumulated tape conservation with the crew at this time. [PAO commentary goes live again at 54:10].</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 54 hours, 44 minutes. The Apollo 16 crew at this time is in the process of donning their Pressure Garment Assemblies, without helmet and gloves. Young and Duke are then scheduled to re-enter the Lunar Module and return to the Command Module and the exercise is part of a check of the procedures that the crew will be using on the day that they performing the landing on the Moon in suiting up and entering the LM. Following this exercise the crew is scheduled to eat, during the eat period they will be running the Skylab food test. There are several Skylab food items packed in with the crews regular food. Such things as snap top cans containing foods such as dried peaches and puddings, peanuts. Also one pack with spoonable foods, some postage stamp size salt dispensers, and the plastic bellows drink containers. And while trying out this food we expect that we will be getting comments from the crew on how easy it is to use the food in its packaging and ease in handling and preparation. They are also scheduled to take some still and motion pictures of the food packages in use. Apollo 16 at the present time is 170,817 nautical miles [316,353 kilometres] from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is 3,063 feet [934 metres] per second.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>055 06 09 Duke:</b> Okay. We're back in the LM - I mean, correction - back in the Command Module, and Ken's closing out putting the probe in right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 06 19 England:</b> Okay. Sounds good. And there's no hurry on this, but when Ken gets all comfortable, we've got that Jet Monitor test.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>055 08 09 Duke:</b> Okay. During the - the - suit donning went okay - in fact, pretty easy until we got to the part of zip - John and I zipping up. And in my suit in the LM, zipping up, John had an extremely difficult time getting the - the restraint zipper closed across the small of my back. It was extremely tight; the only way he was able to do it, was to zip the restraint - the restraint zipper in the front first, so that the zipper would line up a little bit better, and then he got the back part closed. Now the only thing that worries me is that the suit, to me, felt like I'd grown an inch or two, and it was tight in the legs, and I didn't have the LCG on. And with the LCG and everything else, it might have built up where it would have been really bad, and we were wondering if it might be possible to - if you guys would let us let the legs out on this suit maybe a half an inch to an inch. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 09 27 England:</b> Okay. We'll talk about that. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 09 32 Duke:</b> Okay. I'm not even sure that would help, but it felt - it feels like it would to me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 09 37 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 10 08 England:</b> Charlie, I guess that gives us a data point...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 10 10 Duke:</b> Tony, there was no trouble at all with the - with the pressure sealing zipper or the pressure seal. It was just the - the restraint. It was just in that one place in the small of my back.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 10 27 England:</b> Okay. We copy that. I guess that gives us a data point. You grow in zero g.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 10 34 Duke:</b> That's what it feels like - that I stretched out an inch or so.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 10 38 England:</b> You better watch that; you're pretty close to your six feet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 10 43 Duke:</b> Too late now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 11 02 Duke:</b> Okay. Tony, the hatch is back in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 11 04 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 15 32 Mattingly:</b> Houston, are you still there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 15 37 England:</b> Oh, yeah, Ken, we're still here. How are you doing?</p> <a name="055_15_44"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 15 44 Mattingly:</b> Just fine. We got the tunnel closed out, and I'm ready to copy your next procedure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 15 48 England:</b> Okay, stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 16 32 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 16 37 Mattingly:</b> Go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 16 38 England:</b> Okay. We'd like you to disable all the B/D roll jets, and you're cycling against the stops about once every ten minutes, and so expect that you'll get your ISS light some time in there, and when you get it, we don't - you can turn back on the jets; we'd just like to look at it a while.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 17 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. How about if I just go Free?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 17 15 England:</b> Okay. I guess the Free kills the Jet Monitor.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 17 22 Mattingly:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 19 05 England:</b> Ken, Just to verify that, if you go Free - CMC Free - the program doesn't monitor; if you go back to Auto, it does. You don't have to put the program back in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 19 19 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I understand that. I guess I just wasn't thinking then. What I - what I did, Tony, was, rather than leave - leave two axes in control and one of them free, I put all the Manual Attitude switches to Accel Command, and we're still in CMC Mode, Auto.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 19 37 England:</b> Roger. We saw that down here. It looks good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 19 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You can - you know, you can watch it all day long - whatever you want there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 19 47 England:</b> Okay. We'll just watch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 26 11 Mattingly:</b> Sure enough; there it is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 26 17 England:</b> Okay. Seems to work.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 26 20 Mattingly:</b> And, sure enough, just like advertised, there's no status lights on - DSKY warning panel. And I'm gonna go ahead - if it's okay with you, I'll turn off the Channel 11, Bit 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 26 36 England:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 27 00 Mattingly:</b> While we're still outside the dead band, that's not going to work unless I cycle it Free and back to recenter the dead band. You folks want to watch it outside the dead band for a while?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 27 19 England:</b> That's okay. I guess we're happy with it, and we'd like to go ahead and terminate it - terminate the...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 27 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 30 46 England:</b> And, Ken, I guess you can go on to PTC at your convenience.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 30 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I was just getting ready to ask you about that. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 30 59 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 31 14 Mattingly:</b> Do you folks have me to continue using B/D roll?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 31 22 England:</b> Roger. B/D roll.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 55 hours, 35 minutes. A short while ago Ken Mattingly reported that the tunnel had been closed out, indicating that Young and Duke had completed their suit exercise, were back in the Command Module. The tunnel hatch replaced after all of the probe and drogue assembly equipment had been reinstalled. And we heard Charlie Duke report that his suit - when John Young attempted to zip it up across the back appeared to feel tighter than he was used to feeling in that suit. Charlie said he didn't feel this would cause him any particular problems, but he was concerned that perhaps the length would be too short when the suit was pressurized, and suggested the possibility - or at least asked that the people here on the ground look into the possibility of lengthening the suit a bit using laces that are in the legs. This is a relatively minor adjustment and we're reviewing that possibility. And we will get back to Duke at sometime later in the mission with an evaluation of that suggestion. Following that, Ken Mattingly was involved in some activities using the onboard computer checking out a new program flying on this mission. This is a program which during Mattingly's solo activities in orbit around the Moon, would give him a warning using the Inertial Subsystem warning light on the Display Panel, to alert Mattingly to the fact that a thruster was stuck on - should one of the thrusters stick, for example during a sleep period, an opposing thruster would then begin to fire to counteract the effects of this, and the result being an unnecessary depletion of a thruster propellant. In order to avoid this sort of situation, a change has been made in the one of the erasable memory programs - or actually an erasable memory program has been added, which Mattingly will activate during that portion of the mission, and which would give him the warning through the inertial subsystem light, should one of the thrusters stick on. And then you heard the test of that program checked out and he got the light as expected. At the present time Apollo 16 is 172,327 nautical miles [319,150 kilometres] from Earth. And the spacecraft it traveling at a speed now of 3028 feet [923 metres] per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 42 00 England:</b> Okay, Apollo 16. Omni Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 50 26 England:</b> Charlie, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 50 31 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p> <a name="055_50_33"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 50 33 England:</b> Okay, On your tight suit, there, we were wondering if you could say a few words about how it felt during launch day.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 50 43 Duke:</b> Well, it was a little - little tight launch day. We'd - you know, fitted it pressurized, Tony, and it felt okay then. Launch day, I thought the legs were a little tight but not much.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 51 03 Duke:</b> Once we get it zipped, Tony, it feels a little tight, but pressurized it's okay. It's just the zipping part that's worrying us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 51 12 England:</b> Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 51 37 England:</b> Well, everybody is thinking about it, and we'll come back with an answer on it later. Right now I think the general feeling is that most people'd just as soon you not tamper with it unless you feel very strong about it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 51 58 Duke:</b> Well, that's our opinion, too. Our next solution, or our next question is - is maybe breaking out with the LCG and putting all the gear on and seeing how it goes with all of the gear. Our question there is, if we break into one of the LCGs right now, will it affect - get any gas in the tubes; would it affect the startup on the PLSS?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 52 35 England:</b> Okay, we'll work that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 53 33 England:</b> Okay, Charlie, we've looked at that LCG problem and you're right. If you break it out early, we'll probably get gas in there and never be able to get it out, and it will affect your cooling.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 53 49 Duke:</b> Okay. John and I were going to break into those LCGs and sleep in them the night prior to PDI. What do you think about that idea, then?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>055 54 06 England:</b> Okay; they're over there scratching their head again.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>056 07 28 England:</b> Okay, we copy that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 08 10 England:</b> Okay, Ken. That's - that transducer problem, probably. They've had that history of problems with that transducer. Prelaunch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 08 20 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, we remember that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 08 22 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 08 30 Mattingly:</b> It was glitching launch day, but it looks like now it's sort of stabilized.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 08 35 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 09 34 England:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>056 19 24 England:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 19 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay; we're getting reader to go to work on this Skylab food preparation bit, and we're trying to check out some camera settings and all. We've got 16-millimeter magazine allocated for this with CIN film in it, and by checking the most light that I can get on most objects, it looks like we'll be running with the lens wide open aperture at about 1/60 of a second. And I guess I'd like to know if you want to do that, or if you'd like to use a higher ASA and process the film differently.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 20 12 England:</b> Okay; we'll talk about that. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 20 55 Mattingly:</b> Tony, I was just looking here, and if we go to the 18-millimeter lens, we can open it up to a - to a T-1. And that gets our speed up to about 1/250. It looks like a lot better way to operate. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 21 14 England:</b> Ken, the comm's pretty bad right now. We're having a hard time getting that. We understood that the light meter indicates that the film that was indicated to use here probably isn't going to be fast enough, and you're asking to use a faster film. But we didn't und - get there, how severe the problem was.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 22 47 Mattingly:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 22 50 England:</b> Go ahead, Ken. The comm's still pretty bad, though. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 22 56 Duke:</b> Okay, we were going to get started on the bistatic radar frequency check, if you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 23 27 England:</b> Okay, Charlie, I guess we'd like for you to hold off for a minute on that VHF test.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 23 35 Duke:</b> All right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 23 58 England:</b> Ken, Houston. The comm may be a little better now, if you'd go through the problem again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 24 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Tony. It looks like it's not as bright in here as we'd like to be able to get it, and we'll try - try timing it with some of the window shades up to see if we can get it a little brighter. With the cabin floodlights, it looks like 1/60 of a second is about the max I can get off of the 10-millimeter lens. And I was going to suggest either going to the 18, which will give me a little faster shutter speed because it's got a wider aperture, or we'll take a little less photography and just do it when the Sun gives us good illumination through one of the windows.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 24 46 England:</b> Okay, we copy that. We'll work it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 24 51 Mattingly:</b> I think we can get more uniform photography if we did it with the window shades up and with all our lights in one fixed position. That way, we'll get a lot more photography done rather than having to wait. I really don't think you can afford to wait until the Sun's in just the right place to do your eating.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 25 10 England:</b> Roger. Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 25 14 Duke:</b> Okay, Tony, we're going to restow my suit, if you guys don't want us to touch it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 25 22 England:</b> Right, we're not gonna worry about it tonight. We'll have some sort of an answer tomorrow. So you go ahead and stow the suit.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 25 32 Duke:</b> Okay. And our H<sub>2</sub> tank pressure just went back - dropped back down to 240.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 25 39 England:</b> Okay. We saw that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 25 46 Duke:</b> Hup! It's back up to 270.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 31 45 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 12 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 17 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 18 England:</b> Okay. After much debate, I guess we can have you go ahead and use the 18 millimeter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay; thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 29 England:</b> All right. If you're not already done with it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 32 Mattingly:</b> I really think we'll get the - We're - we're stowing one of our passengers here back in his suit bag.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 40 England:</b> (Laughter) All right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 41 Mattingly:</b> And...</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>056 32 43 Mattingly:</b> We're having - You'd be surprised just how long those kind of things take. You know, you start on something like that, and then it almost fits and you refold it, and it almost fits again, and it's only because you know it fits that you keep trying with it. Because you sure couldn't prove it by us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 00 England:</b> Understand. It doesn't sound like too much fun. We'd like to reverse ourselves...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 05 Mattingly:</b> No, I didn't say that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 07 England:</b> Right. We'd like to reverse ourselves on something I sent up awhile ago. It doesn't seem to be any problem with breaking out the LCGs early. They were thinking about a Skylab situation. So that won't be a constraint. As far as whether we want you to try it tomorrow, we'll work that and send it up tomorrow. But there'll be a...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I guess the only thing on that is that we've got a busy day coming, and these things just really take a long time by the time you put on the suit, and then you play with it and then if we have some adjustments to do, too, why, it's going to take a block of time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 45 England:</b> Right. Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 46 Mattingly:</b> So the sooner the better, I guess, which I know you know already.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 49 England:</b> Roger. But I particularly wanted to let you know there was no problem with sleeping in it that night before.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 33 59 Mattingly:</b> That's a big help. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 34 02 Young:</b> Yeah, I didn't think there was. That's what they did on Apollo 10.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 34 08 England:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 34 15 England:</b> Remember Apollo 12, guys, before you do too much with that suit.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 34 21 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 34 40 Young:</b> Of course, the problem is going to be if we can't get it on at all. That's going to be a real problem.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>056 34 46 England:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 56 hours, 46 minutes. The crew should be shortly beginning their dinner which will include Skylab food items that they will be evaluating. At last report Ken Mattingly mentioned that they were busily involved in restowing the suits and when that was completed, they would be scheduled to begin their eat period and to give us an evaluation of the Skylab food packets that they will be trying out at this time. We've also had some additional reports, primarily from Charlie Duke, with some comments from John Young on the tight fitting suit. Duke first reported the suit appeared to fit tighter than he had expected. After they had gone through the exercise of donning the suits and entering the Lunar Module, in his latest report, Duke said that his primary concern was not for the suits fitting properly once it was pressurized then he felt that it would fit properly and be comfortable, but that they might as he was concerned that there might be problem in getting into the suit when wearing the Liquid Cooled Garment. This was not worn during tonight's exercise and Duke suggested that it might be wise to put on the Liquid Cooled Garment at some time and try getting into the suit to see if there would be a problem when getting into the suit in the same configuration that they will be using the day of powered descent, the landing on the Lunar surface. We've recommended that the issue be put to rest for tonight and we are going to think about it here on the ground and see what steps might be taken tomorrow. And deal with the problem following the crew rest period. The Flight Dynamics Officer reports that the expected impact coordinate for the Saturn third stage, the S-IVB, remained virtually unchanged. That predicted impact point is at 1 degree, 50 minutes north and 23 degrees, 18 minutes west and the predicted time of impact remains 75 hours, 7 minutes and 3 seconds. This places the [garble]. We just had a call to the crew. We'll standby for that.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 57 hours, 24 minutes. The series of checks that we have been performing with the spacecraft using the onboard VHF and S-band systems are a preparation for an experiment that'll be performed in lunar orbit - the Bistatic Radar experiment which uses the spacecraft's communications equipment in a passive experiment to determine something about the electromagnetic properties of the lunar surface. The radio signals are reflected off the Moon, and the Moon affects the way in which they are reflected, and these characteristics are measured on Earth in an experiment performed by Taylor Howard of Stanford University. The VHF signals are received by the Stanford Research Institute in California, and the S-band signals are received by the Manned Spaceflight Network Station at Goldstone, California, the 210 foot antenna. Flight Dynamics officer advised us moments ago that while the crew is sleeping at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds, we're scheduled to cross that mythical line known as the lunar Sphere of Influence, the point of which we begin calculating the increasing of the lunar gravity on the spacecraft. Our displays here in Mission Control shortly after that point are generally switched over to Moon reference from Earth reference. The velocities that we have been watching decrease steadily up to now, will then begin to increase as the spacecraft is accelerated toward the Moon. At the present time we show Apollo 16 175,461 nautical miles [324,954 kilometres] from Earth, and traveling at a speed of 2,957 feet [901 metres] per second. As is usually the case when the spacecraft is this far from Earth, and when we're using the omni directional antennas and the spacecraft is rotating in the Passive Thermal Control mode, we do have some noisy communications as we drift from one antenna to the next. And this mission is no exception in that regard, and so we will have from time to time periods of noisy communications.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>058 44 09 Mattingly:</b> [Garble], 16. Can I talk to somebody about chlorine injection?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 44 16 England:</b> Okay. What's the problem?</p> <a name="058_44_26"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 44 26 Mattingly:</b> I'm not sure what the first problem is; I can give you some symptoms. I put the chlorine in, and when I screwed down on it, it seemed like it was just a little bit stiffer to screw down on than they had been before. But it wasn't obvious that it was that much different; because they're always a little tight. And when I went to take it off, I got a whole lot of water bubbling out from around the - the port. And I couldn't tell where it came from. Seemed like it - the first thing I thought of was the same thing that happened to [Apollo] 15 with the nut backing off. And when I got it out, it looked like the - the bubbling seemed to stop fairly quickly, and then I - the first thing I tried to do was to tighten the collar of the adapter down tight, and right now I still have the chlorine injector adap - needle adapter still on the chlorine port. And I tightened it down by hand, and it seems like it's holding it. The chlorine ampoule itself was broken when we took it out of the injector drum. We got all of that mopped up, I wanted to get some buffer in with it - you know, the system, because it looked to me like some of the chlorine had gone in. So I started to try to put some buffer in, and it looked like it might of leaked a little bit. And then I went to take it out - out of the - take the injector out of the adapter, and when I did, it looks like it squirts fluid from two holes that are 180 [degrees] apart from each other on the adapter. And I guess I don't know what those two holes are for. It looks like maybe the needle is not going in, but I'm not sure what it is, now. Do you have someone that might know how to put it together? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 46 32 England:</b> Roger; we'll talk about that. I know all about those two holes in that adapter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 46 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay, these are the two on the outside now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 46 37 England:</b> Roger. I know exactly which ones you're talking about.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 50 59 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 51 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 51 05 England:</b> Okays, when you put that buffer in, would you verify that you left the nut all the way screwed down for the ten minutes and that's the period when the water was coming out the two holes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 51 22 Mattingly:</b> No, the water comes out of those holes - Let's see now. I put the buffer in, I put it into the injector and then I put the injector into the adapter, and when I went to screw down on the injector, it looked like it was starting to seep fluid around the injector again. So I stopped, and it didn't look like it was doing any more, and I thought I would look and see. By this time, I was getting suspicious that maybe the needle wasn't open. So I decided to take the injector off of the needle adapter. I took it off, and everything looked okay. And it was when I went to put it back on, when I depressed the needle to - when you push the injector onto the adapter - that's when it looked like it squirted out of these two holes on the side and I did that several times and it repeated itself. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 52 23 England:</b> Okay, we copy that. Was the nut snugly against the ampoule when you tried to put it back on? If you backed off on the nut, it may have allowed the - it may have allowed the ampoule to slide back up in the compartment there and then you were just opening up the needle.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 52 49 Mattingly:</b> Well, I - I thought it was down snug. If it wasn't snug, would have - would it push water out of those two side ports?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 52 59 England:</b> Yes, it sure would. I had that happen in the prechlorination there on the pad before launch. I had backed off on the nut and, instead of just filling up that ampoule, the water pushed the ampoule off the needle and then, once it's done that, the water just goes back around and comes out those two holes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 53 29 Mattingly:</b> Well, I can't say that didn't happen. The first problem occurred with the chlorine injection. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 53 36 England:</b> Right, I didn't see that on the pad.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 53 42 Mattingly:</b> Yep. My first problem was when I went to put the chlorine ampoule in. And at some point in there when I went to take it out, I tried to get it in and it didn't look right. When I went to take it out, it started bubbling all over, and I couldn't tell where it was coming from then. And whether it came from those two holes or not, that's quite possible. I'm not sure. When I looked at the ampoule itself, after I opened up the injector, you could see that the - the bottom lug had broken, the little sliding plug in there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 19 England:</b> Right. Once that thing isn't watertight anymore, you'll get leakage into that container and that'll all come out those holes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Then perhaps the only problem was the - was the one with the first ampoule breaking. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 40 England:</b> All right, we'll try to get you a procedure here and go back and try that buffer...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 45 Mattingly:</b> The [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 46 England:</b> ... again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 47 Mattingly:</b> Say again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 48 England:</b> I was going to say we'll try to get you to agree on a procedure here and then go back and try the buffer again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 54 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess - yeah, we could do that. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 55 00 England:</b> Okay. Hold off on that. We'll - we'll get a procedure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 55 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Is that something you want to do tonight or do it tomorrow?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 55 10 England:</b> You want that buffer in there tonight, don't you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 55 19 Mattingly:</b> I don't know. It's a - I - I can't vouch for how much chlorine went in. Perhaps - very little. It's up to the - the guys who have plumbing responsibilities. I - I just can't tell you how much chlorine may have gotten in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 55 34 England:</b> Okay, we understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 56 00 England:</b> Okay, Ken. I - I guess we'd like you to take that buffer ampoule again and screw the nut down on it so that you think it's - it's good - good and snug in there, and then put it on the adapter and see if you can - see if it'll take the buffer. Before you - you close it all up again, you might look at the ampoule to make sure it hasn't cracked.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 58 21 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 58 57 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 01 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 02 England:</b> Did you get that about going ahead with the buffer?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 05 Mattingly:</b> No, I didn't.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 06 England:</b> Oh, okay; we probably had some bad comm there. We'd like you to take a look at that buffer ampoule and make sure it isn't cracked and, if not, then to go ahead and put it in that little container and screw that nut so you feel it's good and snug and then go ahead and see if it will take the buffer.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay. How about if I just take a brand new one? Don't we have a couple spares?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 40 England:</b> Okay. Yeah, they agree. Why don't you take a brand new one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And while I'm doing that, I'm just looking over the gages, and I know our onboard gaging isn't the greatest thing in RCS. Could you tell me how we stand on RCS?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>058 59 57 England:</b> Okay. I'll get that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 01 10 England:</b> And, Ken, at 54 hours, you were two percent ahead of your RCS budget - that's 25 pounds to the good. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 01 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 01 24 England:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 01 25 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] I guess we have a low bias in quad A and just kind of looks bad.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 01 43 England:</b> Okay. We - our bias is that you're reading 2 percent low on that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 01 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 02 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Tony, I've got the buffer in, and I noticed just a slight little spit when I put it in. That's probably residual. So I'll wait ten minutes and then suck it out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 03 01 England:</b> Okay. Good show.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 06 05 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. The O<sub>2</sub> Flow High and the cabin is pumped up to 5.7.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 06 12 England:</b> Okay. We copy that, John.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9 minutes. The crew at this time completing the items on their checklist prior to getting an eight hour rest period. And we had a description from Ken Mattingly of some problems he was having getting the chlorine and buffer injected into the drinking water system. This is done with a syringe type device which injects the chlorine and the buffer alternately through a diaphragm in the waste - in the water management panel of the spacecraft. This is injected through with a hypodermic needle arrangement. And from the descriptions given by Mattingly and the discussions that he had with CapCom, Tony England, it appears that the problem he had was related to the way in which the ampoules of chlorine and particularly the buffer are placed in the syringe. They are held in place by the nut that screws down on the ampoule and a plunger device then is activated which drives the buffer out of the syringe and into the water supply. Apparently the nut is not down tight enough holding the - which would have allowed the process to ride up off the needle and instead of buffer being injected into the water, water was allowed to flow back out and come out of the syringe. Mattingly reported when he followed the procedure outlined by Tony England that apparently the buffer was injected properly and we believe that sufficient chlorine was injected to take care of the requirements there and the plan at this point is to put the crew to bed as soon as possible. At the present time we are showing Apollo 16 178,435 nautical miles [330,462 kilometres] from Earth and the speed of the spacecraft at this time 2,891 feet [881 metres] per second. In about eight minutes Apollo 16 will be crossing the imaginary line designating the lunar Sphere of Influence. At this point the Moon's gravitational force becomes the dominate gravity force acting on the spacecraft. And here in the control center our displays are monitoring the spacecraft velocity and altitude will switch over from Earth reference which we've been using the bulk of the flight to Moon reference. At that point the Earth will be 178,673 nautical miles [330,902 kilometres] from the spacecraft and the spacecraft will be 33,821 miles [62,636 kilometres] from the Moon. The velocity of the spacecraft with respect to the Earth at that point will be 2,887 feet [880 metres] per second and with respect to the Moon it will be traveling 3,482 feet [1,061 metres] per second. The time of that sphere crossing is 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 16 33 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 16 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Tony, got that buffer in and out, and all looks normal now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 16 54 England:</b> Okay. Good show.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 17 34 Mattingly:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 17 36 England:</b> Go ahead, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 17 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Looks like we've got the buffer in and water back out, and everything looks normal now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 17 50 England:</b> Good show. If - if you didn't get much chlorine in the buffer, won't hurt anything, but it would have hurt the other way if you'd put the chlorine in without adding the buffer, so - either way, we're in good shape now. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 18 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Then I guess our only problem then was just the fact that I probably broke that first chlorine ampoule some way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 18 16 England:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 20 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Tony. I guess I'm ready to give you a film status report.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 20 42 England:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 20 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay. On magazine Victor Victor, we're on frame 21; magazine Hotel Hotel, frame 85; magazine Oscar Oscar, frame 34; November November is also 34; Juliet Juliet is 50 percent.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 21 12 England:</b> Was that 50 percent? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 21 16 Mattingly:</b> That's 50 percent. That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 21 18 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 21 25 England:</b> Okay. We copied all those.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>059 22 50 England:</b> Good show. And I guess there's nothing else down here. Would you like me to hum to you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 23 00 Young:</b> Tony, even that won't keep me awake.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 23 03 England:</b> (Laughter) Oh, yeah, it would. I'll see y'all on the Moon. I've got a day off tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 23 16 Young:</b> Good show.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 23 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 23 18 Young:</b> Sounds good. See you tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 23 19 England:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>059 23 20 Young:</b> Good night.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. While we were in the process of completing those last few items with the crew before saying good night, Apollo 16 crossed into the Moon's sphere of influence, and we're now showing the spacecraft at an altitude of 33,680 nautical miles [62.375 kilometres] from the Moon and traveling at a speed of 3,482 feet [1,061 metres] per second, and that velocity is increasing. The time again of that sphere crossing was 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds. At 59 hours, 24 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 3 minutes. At present time we're in the midst of a shift handover in Mission Control. Our Flight Director Phil Shaffer is coming on to replace Flight Director Pete Frank. The spacecraft communicator on the on coming shift will be astronaut Hank Hartsfield replacing astronaut Tony England. And at present time Apollo 16 is 32, 321 nautical miles [59,858 kilometres] from the Moon. Traveling at a speed of 3,492 feet [1,064 metres] per second. During this past shift the major activities for the crew included another activation and check out of the Lunar Module. At 53 hours, 28 minutes, Duke and Young transferred into the LM and switched over from Command Module power for that vehicle to the LMS. All power systems, activated communications equipment and completed some general housekeeping activities aboard the LM. They then returned to the Command Module and all three crewmen donned their pressure garment assemblies, less helmets and gloves, and Duke and Young re-entered the Lunar Module checking out the procedures that they'll use the day of the lunar landing for suiting up and ingressing the Lunar Module. Following this exercise Charlie Duke reported that they had some difficulties when John Young attempted to close one of the large restrain zippers on Duke's suit. And he said when the zipper - when they tried to get the zipper closed across the small of his back that Young had to exert quite a bit of force to get the zipper to close. Later Charlie Duke reported that although he was not concerned that the suit would be comfortable once pressurized, there was some concern that they might have difficulties getting the suit zipped up when he was wearing the liquid cooled garment. And this is normally worn under the suits during the EVA's. It was not worn after the exercise tonight and Duke suggested that it might be a wise idea to try the suit with the liquid cooled garment underneath to make sure that it would be possible to close the zipper. And he also raised the possibility of lengthening the suit using series of laces which were built into the suit. Now we advised him to leave the problem where it was for tonight and we're going to be looking at it both here in the Control Center and in the Engineering Support rooms in Building 45. Also among our crew systems people and determine what the next step should be. There seems to be no undue concern about the problem here. The feeling was that if the suit fit during the time that it was worn for the launch, that it would fit prior to the lunar landing and the EVA's. However, we will be looking into the problem in more detail and coming up with some recommendations for the crew following their rest period. Also on the list of activities during this shift the crew ran a check of the equipment which will be used in the Bistatic Radar experiment while in lunar orbit. Transmitting S-band and VHF signals which we'll receive the VHF signal as was received at Stanford as it will be during the actual experiment in lunar orbit allowing scientist there to calibrate equipment and to determine the precise frequencies that the spacecraft equipment will be operating on. And there were a number of items from the Skylab food which were included in the menu for tonight's dinner. The astronauts were evaluating this food both it's packaging and ease of preparation. They were taking motion pictures and still photos of the preparation and will be providing post flight detailed reports on how this operation went. John Young made the comment that there were very few casualties and no loss of life following the use of the Skylab food. He did comment that it took as he put it a lot longer than they had allowed for. I think the supposition here in the Control Center was that he was talking for about the documentation procedures, the filming and the still photography. And we had one minor problem in the chlorination of the drinking water supply. This is done in two steps. Chlorine is injected using a hypodermic type syringe and this device injects the chlorine through a needle and then through a diaphragm which then allows it to be inter-mixed with the drinking water. This is followed with an injection of buffer and Ken Mattingly reported some difficulty in injecting the chlorine and he said when he checked the process which holds the chlorine was broken and he also said that when he tried to inject the buffer that instead of buffer going in, water came out. Tony England, Capsule communicator on this shift recalled having a similar experience prelaunch when he was chlorinating the drink water in the spacecraft on the launch pad. And we very quickly remedied that situation with a recommendation from England that the nut which holds the process into the syringe be firmly up against the syringe to permit the process from separating from the needle and allowing water to come out rather than buffer to be injected in. Mattingly double checked his procedure and tried again and the second time around reported that everything went as planned with no problem. Also on this shift we crossed this mythical line known as the Lunar Sphere of Influence at which point we begin calculating our spacecraft velocities and altitudes with respect to the Lunar Module. Also at this point that theoretically the moon becomes the dominant force acting upon the spacecraft from a gravity point of view and the spacecraft begins to accelerate towards the Moon. At that point Apollo 16 was 178,673 nautical miles [330,902 kilometres] from Earth and 33,821 nautical miles [62,636 kilometres] from the Moon. That event occurred at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. At 59 hours, 23 minutes or a little less than one hour ago, actually about 50 minutes ago, we said good night to the crew and we've heard nothing from them since. They have an eight hour rest period scheduled. During that time we will take the air-to-ground line down. We'll be recording any conversations should we have unscheduled or unexpected conversation with the crew. We'll play that back following receipt. And we'll be giving periodic status reports. At 60 hours, 12 minutes this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 60 hours, 51 minutes since lift-off. We now show Apollo 16 at 30,683 nautical miles [56,825 kilometres] away from the Moon, velocity now reads 3,503 feet [1,068 metres] per second; this velocity relative to the Moon. Phil Shaffer's again the Flight Director for the White Team of flight controllers who are now on duty in the Mission Control. As previously reported, the crew of Apollo 16 is in their sleep period. Right now, we expect that Young, Duke and Mattingly will be allowed an extra hour of sleep making the wake-up time at 67 hours Ground Elapsed Time. At 61 hours [means 60 hours], 52 minutes into the mission; this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 61 hours, 51 minutes into the mission. The crew of Apollo 16 continuing with their rest period as Apollo 16 continues on course toward lunar orbit. We presently show Apollo 16 at 28,605 nautical miles [52,976 kilometres] away from the Moon; velocity now reads 3,520 feet [1,073 metres] per second. Very little conversation over the Flight Director's loop in the Mission Operations Control Room. One of the items to be decided on this shift however, is the requirement for Midcourse Correction Number 4 prior to a Lunar Orbit Insertion. If it is decided to do it, MCC-4 will be a small maneuver. We're at 61 hours and 52 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 62 hours, 51 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Our displays in Mission Control now show Apollo 16, 26,522 nautical miles [49,119 kilometres] away from the Moon and traveling at a velocity of 3,540 feet [1,079 metres] per second. Meanwhile in the Control Center we continue in our systems monitoring mode as the White Flight Control Team continues to maintain their logs and update their planning notes for handover to the next team of flight controllers. The next team will be on duty when the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn occurs. This morning the surgeon is monitoring commander John Young's sleep response. He selects a different crew member each evening and he reports that Young is resting well. We're at 62 hours, 52 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 63 hours, 52 minutes into the mission. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 24,470 nautical miles [45,318 kilometres] from the Moon and traveling at a velocity of 3,567 feet per second [1,087 metres/second]. Our CapCom Hank Hartsfield has not spoken with the crew on this shift yet this morning. However, he will place the wake-up call and the wake-up call is now scheduled for a bit over three hours from this time. We're at 63 hours, 53 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 64 hours, 51 minutes into the mission. We now show the Apollo 16 spacecraft at 24,237 [means 22,237] nautical miles [41,183 kilometres] away from the Moon. We've had no contact with the crew of Apollo 16 for the past hour nor do we expect contact with the crew for a bit more than two hours. Crew wake-up time is now two hours and eight minutes away. We'll stand by however, and continue to monitor our conversations within the Mission Control Center and the various displays. At 64 hours, 52 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 65 hours, 51 minutes into the mission. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 20,195 nautical miles [37,401 kilometres] away from the Moon, and traveling now at a velocity of 3,626 feet [1,105 metres] per second. The crew of Apollo 16 can expect their wake-up call in a bit over an hour. Our countdown clock in Mission Control shows one hour, eight minutes remaining until time of wake-up. The Flight Plan for the up-coming day for the crew, is essentially unchanged, however, one item is still open, this being the decision on whether or not to do Midcourse Correction 4. We're at 65 hours, 52 minutes Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
