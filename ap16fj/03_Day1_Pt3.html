      <p class="ed">[The Apollo 16 spacecraft, together with the S-IVB third-stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, has almost completed its first orbit around the Earth. After a long transit across the Pacific, during which they were out of communication with Mission Control, John Young, Charlie Duke and Ken Mattingly are about to start the preparation for Trans Lunar Insertion - the firing of the S-IVB booster to send Apollo 16 out of Earth orbit and towards the Moon. To help readers find the more significant parts, the following is a short index of the main events.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>001 33 59 Fullerton:</b> Okay, I'm ready with theTLI plus 90 and the P37 for lift-off plus eight. We're putting togethera story and looking at the APS module. No immediate action isnecessary, so let's get the PADs out of the way.</p>
      <p class="ed">[<a name="pad"></a>Throughout the mission, large lists ofnumbers, called PADs, will be read up to the crew which give them theinformation necessary to carry out a particular manoeuvre. PAD standsfor Pre-Advisory Data. Some of these "block data" are for plannedmanoeuvres such as the TLI (Translunar Injection) or LOI (Lunar OrbitInsertion) burns. Other PADs, such as the "TLI plus 90" and "Lift-offplus 8" mentioned here are the first of 27 abort options which will beread up to the crew at scheduled times throughout the early and middleportions of the mission. Note that the TLI+90 PAD has nothing to dowith TLI itself but would occur 90 minutes after a successful TLI burnin the event of an abort. However, mission planners have decided thatat no time beyond Earth orbit will the crew be without a get-you-homePAD. If at any time the crew subsequently lose communication withEarth, they will have the information to hand to get themselves backmanually.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[To simplify the voice transmission of these huge listsof numbers and reduce the likelihood of errors, each type of PAD wasprecisely formatted both in Mission Control's and the crew's paperwork- all thecrew needed to do was fill in the blanks.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[The abort PADs are the responsibility of RETRO, one ofthe flight controllers in the front row of the MOCR (Mission OperationsControl Room). According to Chuck Deiterich, who was one of those whooccupiedthe RETRO console throughout Apollo, "There is quite a bit of protocolin the PAD process. Empty PADs were in tablets of no carbon required(NCR) paper. We would make about six copies and use a red ballpoint onthe top (original) so the CapCom would be sure what was part of theprinted form and what was data." (2003 correspondence).]</p>

      <p class="ed">[As Fullerton reads the PAD, a complete P30 type, CharlieDuke copies the values to the appropriate form in the checklist. <img style="width: 400px; height: 561px;" alt="TLI Plus 90 PAD" src="pics/TLI90PAD.gif" align="right"></p>
      <p class="ed">[Interpretation of this particular PAD is as follows:</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Purpose:</b> In the event of a serious problem soonafter a good Translunar Injection, this PAD has the details of a burnwhich would return them quickly to the Earth. It has an ignition timeof 90 minutes after TLI. In the event of such an emergency, the SPS(Service Propulsion System) engine would be used to slow the spacecraftto below Earth escape velocity, resulting in a high altitude ballisticarc that would take them directly to splashdown without any furtherorbits. Full procedures for the TLI plus 90 abort are given onPage <a href="csmlc/a16L4-13.gif">L4-13</a> of the CSMLaunch Checklist</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>System:</b> The burn would be under the control of theGuidance and Navigation System. Burns can also be controlled by the SCS(Stabilization Control System).</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>CSM weight (Noun 47):</b> Calculated to be 66,973pounds (30,378 kilograms).</p>
      <p class="ed">Note that here, and in all the NASA documentation of thetime, the term "weight" is freely used in the context where, strictlyspeaking, "mass" ought to be used. Weight is defined as the forceapplied by a mass in a gravity field. In free fall, mass remains thesame while weight becomes essentially zero.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Pitch and yaw trim (Noun 48):</b> -0.54&deg; and +1.89&deg;.</p>
      <p class="ed">The SPS engine bell is gimbal mounted to allow its thrustvector to be aligned with the spacecraft's computed centre of gravity.Two thumb wheels on the left of the Main Display Console allowadjustment of these pitch and yaw trim angles.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Time of ignition, T<sub>IG</sub> (Noun 33):</b> 4hours, 3 minutes and 18.55 seconds, Ground Elapsed Time.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Change in velocity (Noun 81), fps (m/s):</b> x, -356.2(-108.6);y, +0.1 (+0.03); z, +3,600.1 (+1,097.3). This is the change invelocity as defined along three orthogonal axes with respect to thelocalvertical/local horizontal.</p>
      <p class="ed">The three velocity components in a PAD are alwaysexpressed with respect to the local vertical/local horizontal. Imaginea coordinate system based on a line from the spacecraft to the centreof the Earth or Moon. (Which you use depends on the sphere of influenceyou are in, ie which gravitational field is stronger.) This line is theZ-axis and is vertical at the point where it intersects the surface.The X-axis is perpendicular to this in whatever direction thespacecraft's orbit is taking it. It is therefore parallel to the localhorizontal. The Y-axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. Thisarrangement holds even for a very extended elliptical orbit like theone Apollo 16 will take to the Moon, where the spacecraft is clearlynot travelling parallel to the local horizontal.</p>
      <p class="ed">In the above burn, we can see that the largest componentof velocity change is in the plus-Z direction which is towards theEarth, countering the spacecraft's velocity away from the planet.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Spacecraft attitude at T<sub>ig</sub>:</b> Roll, 181&deg;;Pitch, 232&deg;; Yaw, 2&deg;.</p>
      <p class="ed">Although the velocity change is expressed with respect tothe local horizontal, spacecraft attitude is expressed with respect tothe current alignment of the guidance platform. That alignment iscurrently set to the launch pad <a target="new" href="acron.html#refsmmat">REFSMMAT</a>.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>H<sub>A</sub> and H<sub>P</sub> (Noun 44):</b> These are the heights of the resulting orbit's apogee and perigee, respectively. Since the computer cannot display an altitude higher than 9999.9 nautical miles, and the maximum height of the CSM during a TLI+90 abort will be much higher than that, H<sub>A</sub> is not applicable. The perigee of the "orbit" is targeted at 18.9 nautical miles (35.0 km). A perigee so low will intercept the Earth's atmosphere and cause the spacecraft to re-enter.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Delta-V<sub>T</sub>:</b> 3618.3 fps (1,103.8 m/s). This is the total velocity change that would be experienced by the spacecraft. It is a vector sum of the three components given earlier.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Burn duration or burn time:</b> 5 minutes, 04 seconds.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Delta-V<sub>C</sub>:</b> 3,604.0 fps (1,098.5 m/s). This figure would be entered into the EMS (Entry Monitor System) Delta-V display.</p>
      <p class="ed">SPS engine burns are normally controlled by the G&amp;N system. If it is a long burn, that is, greater than six seconds, the control is closed loop. The system monitors the achieved Delta-V and shuts down the engine at the appropriate time. In doing this, it takes account of the engine tail-off impulse. It knows how the thrust expected from this tail-off and can calculate the resulting tail-off Delta-V based on this and the spacecraft mass.</p>
      <p class="ed">If the G&amp;N system were to fail during a burn, the EMS would provide a backup means of shutting down the engine at the right time. This equipment carries a separate accelerometer which measures Delta-V along the longitudinal axis of the spacecraft. Prior to the burn, the crew enter the expected Delta-V into a display on the EMS. As the burn progresses, the figure showing the remaining Delta-V drops towards zero, at which time the EMS itself shuts down the EMS if the G&amp;N system has not already done so. However, the EMS has no knowledge of the tail-off thrust. The flight controllers take this into account and give the crew a low Delta-V figure for entering into the EMS so that if it is called upon to shut down the engine it will do so early enough for the tail-off thrust to effect the correct total Delta-V.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Sextant star:</b> Star number 26, Spica, should bevisible through the sextant when itsshaft and trunnion are set to the values 73.4� and 15.1� respectively.</p>
      <p class="ed">[As CapCom Gordon Fullerton was reading up the PAD, thecommunication route was transferred to a ship in the Atlantic, USNSVanguard. The changeover has caused Charlie to miss some of theinformation.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>001 36 12 Fullerton:</b> Charlie, this is Houston.How do you read now?</p>
      <p class="ed">[The communications link has transferred to theVanguard...]</p>

      <p class="ed">[The Boresight star is number 37, Nunki or SigmaSagittarius, which should be visible through the sextant when its shaftand trunnion are set to the values 25.7&deg; and 2.9&deg; respectively.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="ed">The next five parameters all relate to re-entry, during which an important milestone is &quot;Entry Interface,&quot; defined as being 400,000 feet (121.92 km) altitude. In this context, a more important milestone is when atmospheric drag on the spacecraft imparts a deceleration of 0.05 g.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Expected splashdown point (Noun 61):</b> 21.31&deg; south, 165.00&deg; west; in the mid-Pacific.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Range to go at the 0.05 g event:</b> 1,093.2 nautical miles. To set up their EMS (Entry Monitor System) before re-entry, the crew need to know the expected distance the CM would travel from the 0.05 g event to landing. This figure will be decremented by the EMS based on signals from its own accelerometer.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Expected velocity at the 0.05 g event:</b> 34,867 fps. This is another entry for the EMS. It is entered into the unit's Delta-V counter and will be decremented based on signals from its own accelerometer.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Predicted GET of 0.05 g event:</b> Expected at 23 hours, 08 minutes and 28 seconds GET.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>GDC Align stars:</b> Stars Sirius (in Canis Major) and Rigel (in Orion) are to be used to align the gyro assemblies if it is not possible to use the guidance platform for this purpose. The align angles are 317&deg;, 108&deg;, 005&deg;.</p>
      <p class="ed">The spacecraft has two independent systems fordetermining attitude and change in attitude. The primary system is the<a href="acron.html#imu">IMU</a> and its freely stable platform. Asecondary system, usually tied tothe <a href="acron.html#scs">SCS</a>, comprises a set of gyros attachedto the spacecraft structure.Unlike the IMU, which measures absolute attitude, these gyro assembliesmeasure the rate of attitude change. If need be, absolute attitude canbe derived from these but this measurement is imprecise so at regulartimes, the crew presses the GDC Align button to make the GDCs (GyroDisplay Couplers) knowledge of attitude match the IMU. In casethe IMU is not working,the crew have a backup method of aligning the GDCs by sighting twostars through the scanning telescope in a particular way.

      <p class="ed">[The term "ullage" comes from the brewing industry, whereit means the space above the beer in a brewer's vat., but in thiscontext it means the volume in the spacecraft propellant tanks that isfilled with helium gas. In a spacecraft, fuel will float freelyin the tanks, unless it is constrained. However, it is essentialthat there are no bubbles of helium in the propellant before it is fedinto theengines. In smaller tanks, such as those of the RCS, Teflonbladders are used to control the fuel and to separate it from thehelium used to pressurise the tanks. But in larger tanks, such asthe four main ones of the SPS, bladders cannot be used and so a shortperiod of acceleration is required to force the fuel to the bottom ofthe tank (and the helium to the top) before the SPS fires. Thisacceleration is provided by the RCS firing for a few seconds.Normally, the SPS will command this automatically, but in event of afailure of the automatic system, the Direct Ullage switch on Panel 1 ofthe MDC provides a back-upcapability for initiating the RCS ullage burn. The Direct UllageSwitch is backed up by two circuit breakers on Panel 8, which must beenergised to enable the switch to work. A complex system, butnecessary to provide the necessary safety.]</p>

Analysis of flight data indicates thepresence of low amplitude,approximately 65 hertz, vibration during the S-II stage burn and bothS-IVB stage burns. The data show lateral amplitudes of �0.10 g at theIU during S-IVB first burn and �0.20 during second burn. The vibrationscan also be seen on selected propulsion pressure measurements. A reviewof AS-510 [Apollo 15] data shows similar vibration at approximately 72hertz. Because of the data characteristics, the vibration issuspected to be related to normal stage propulsion system operation andprobably characteristic of the J-2 turbomachinery. These vibrationspose no pogo or any other structural concerns, and are of such lowamplitude as to be virtually obscured in the measurement backgroundnoise." A rather bland engineering report on a phenomenon that gave thecrew considerable concern!]</p>
