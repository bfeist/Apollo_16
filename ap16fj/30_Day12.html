        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control through 283 hours, 58 minutes [259:11] Ground Elapsed Time. One minute away from wakeup call. Spacecraft Communicator Tony England, standing by for good antenna swing by on the spacecraft before making his reveille call. Apollo 16, [now] 45,306 miles out from Earth. Velocity building up fairly rapidly now, [at] 9,174 feet per second. When Apollo 16 enters the atmosphere, some 6 hours and 24 minutes from now, it will be travelling four times as fast as it is now. We have confirmation of the High Gain locked in. Here goes Tony England.</p>
        <p class="ed">[The PAO, Mission Control and Crew are using the updated GET, intended to align events to the Flight Plan. At this stage in the flight, the difference from the actual GET is 24 hours, 45 minutes and 52 seconds. See <a href="transcription.html#timings">here</a> for more details.]</p> <a name="259_15_18"></a>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:15:18 England:</b> Good morning, Apollo 16.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:15:42 England:</b> Good morning, good morning up there.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:15:53 Young:</b> Good morning, good morning down there.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:16:15 England:</b> Well, we see on this biomed that old Charlie woke up. He was really sawing away there.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:16:28:Young:</b> Charlie was sawing away on his biomed?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:16:30 England:</b> Sure was.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:16:33 Young:</b> I wouldn't be surprised. That's probably why it doesn't work. Termites do the same thing.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:20:00 England:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. Would you switch your High Gain to Medium?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:20:14 Young:</b> Yeah, Medium on the High Gain.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:20:17 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:33:45 England:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:33:51 Young:</b> Go ahead. Over.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:33:52 England:</b> Okay. We've only got one minor change to your Flight Plan. Some high gain angles for a P52 at 285:48 when you want them.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:34:13 Young:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:34:14 England:</b> Okay. Pitch, minus 28; Yaw, 96. And Stu will be in, in a little while, to talk about changes to your Entry Checklist. But that should do it for the Flight Plan. All your systems looked nominal through the night. We don't know about the Mid-Course 7 yet. Right now, you're in the corridor and it looks - it looks pretty good - like maybe you won't have to do one. If you did one, it wouldn't be any more than a foot and a half.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:34:48 Young:</b> Understand.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:34:54 England:</b> You're just slightly shallow. Give you a little softer ride.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:35:17 England:</b> And could you go Wide on the High Gain, please?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:35:29 Young:</b> High Gain, Wide.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:35:31 England:</b> Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:02 England:</b> 16, Houston.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:07 Young:</b> Go ahead, Over.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:08 Griffin:</b> Hey, John. This is Gold Flight. We're going to be handing over down here shortly and our last shift with you - We wanted to let you know that we really commend you for a job well done and be looking forward to seeing you when you get back to Houston.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:24 Young:</b> Okay, Gold Flight. I tell you, we certainly enjoyed you, particularly on that descent. That was something else, wasn't it?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:31 Griffin:</b> It was a pretty long day. I'm sure it was for you. It sure was for us.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:36 Young:</b> Yeah, you bet.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:44 Duke:</b> Gerry, thanks for everything. We'll be seeing you when we get back.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:47 Griffin:</b> Okay, Charlie.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:36:59 Griffin:</b> Incidentally, I talked to Lee [Silver] yesterday, and he sends you all a 'Very well done.'</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:37:08 Young:</b> Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:39:35 Mattingly:</b> Tony, you still there?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:39:37 England:</b> Yeah. Go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:39:40 Mattingly:</b> Would you have your friend on the left take a look at my biomed?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:39:45 England:</b> Okay. He says you look healthy.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:39:56 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:40:19 England:</b> Incidentally, I think Lee's comments really mean you passed the course. I hope so anyway.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:40:40 Duke:</b> If we didn't, we'd like to go back and try again.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:40:44 England:</b> That would be a good deal, wouldn't it?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:40:47 Young:</b> Yeah, maybe you can fix that up for us so we can go back and try it again.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:40:55 Duke:</b> There's another 400 or 500 pounds up there, Tony, we'd like to bring you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:41:05 Young:</b> We didn't make Lee's ton a year, but we're working on it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:41:10 England:</b> (Laughter) Yeah, if you don't get a - get a ton - Lee's going to be disappointed. No, I don't think so. I think he's pretty happy.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:51:02 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. With the crew status report.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:51:07 England:</b> Go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:51:08 Young:</b> Okay. For the Commander, A1 is still stowed, A3 is 7 hours, A4 is none, A5 is 1725 ... </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:51:45 England:</b> John, we lost comm there about the CDR's A-5. If you can do that one again, please.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:51:52 Young:</b> Okay. A-5: 17, 25, and 16; A-6 is: 1 is 8, 2 is 4, 3 is 6, 4 is 5, and 5 is 8. All those - all those quantities are in ounces.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:52:13 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:52:22 Young:</b> CMP: B-1, 15072; B-3, 6 hours; B-4, none - B-2 is 40 and 50. B-6: 1 is 5 ounces; 2 is 6 ounces; 3, 5 ounces; 4, 5 ounces.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:52:58 England:</b> Okay.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>259:53:28:England:</b> Okay. We copy that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:53:39 Young:</b> Okay, back to the - to the chow. Yesterday, we were working on Day 11 food, and we - For the CDR Meal A, scratch the coffee with K; meal B, scratch the rye bread, change the tuna spread to 2/3, and change the - change the tuna spread from tuna spread to ham salad, and change the cocoa with K to citrus beverage with K.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:54:28:England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:54:31 Young:</b> And on Meal C, scratch the romaine soup and the pecans, and add &frac12; tuna salad.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:54:46 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:54:54 Young:</b> On the CMP: for breakfast, scratch the grits; Meal B, scratch the grapefruit bar and the graham crackers; Meal C, substitute ham for beef steak, scratch the chicken and rice, scratch the pecans, scratch the grape drink, add orange-pineapple drink, gingerbread.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>259:56:01 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:56:19 Young:</b> And on the LMP: for breakfast, scratch the bacon squares from Meal A; Meal B, scratch the lobster bisque, and the rye - and the rye bread. Wait a second here, somebody's got a little disagreement on what we ate here. It's not, incidentally, the first time that that's happened. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:57:17 England:</b> We'd like you to get started toward that galactic anti-centerpoint attitude, whatever that is.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:57:59 Young:</b> Okay, we're going that way.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:58:00 England:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:58:18 Young:</b> Okay, let's start over on Meal B for the LMP.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:58:23 England:</b> All right.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:58:24 Young:</b> I've been correc - I've been corrected here. Do not scratch the lobster bisque. And substitute for tuna spread, ham spread.

        <p class="tech"><b>259:59:22 Young:</b> Okay, and the injector valve temps are looking as follows: 5C, 4.5; 5D, 4.6; 6A, 4.1; 6B, 4.4; 6C, 4.9; 6D, 4.4. Which means no heatup.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>259:59:51 England:</b> Okay, copy that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:02:06 England:</b> Apollo 16, we'd like Auto on the High Gain.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:02:15 Young:</b> You have it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:02:40 England:</b> Hey, fellows. Hank's here, and have a good ride in. We'll see you in a couple of days.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>260:02:57 England:</b> Thank you.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 285 hours [260:13] Ground Elapsed Time. We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 39,820 nautical miles away from the Earth. The velocity now reads 9,807 feet per second and in the Mission Control Center in Houston, we've had a shift changeover. Phil Shaffer is now our Flight Director. Our Capcom is now Henry Hartsfield. We're at 285 hours [260:13] Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston. </p> (NO COMM FOR 23 MINUTES) <p class="tech"><b>260:25:46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We just got her again.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:25:52 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:26:30 Mattingly:</b> And, Houston; this time we've got the ISS light on and it's remaining on.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:26:34 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy, Ken.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:27:08 Mattingly:</b> Program alarm was resetable, as you probably noticed.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:27:13 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And you - But you still have the light, is that affirmative?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:27:17 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:27:18 Young:</b> Affirmative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:28:13 Mattingly:</b> Okays, Houston, could we proceed through Malfunction Number 6 here?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:28:24 Hartsfield:</b> They're debating that, Ken. Just a second.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:28:28:Mattingly:</b> Okay. The Noun 20s check with the FDAI very closely.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:28:41 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Ken, why don't you press on through that malfunction 6 there on Page 28; and remember, if you get down to box 12, you have to kill the DAP.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:28:53 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:29:24 Hartsfield:</b> Do you have any questions on killing the DAP, Ken?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:29:28:Mattingly:</b> No, sir.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:29:50 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that time when I went to do a Verb 40, just about the time it should have run its time out and blanked the DSKY, we got another Program Alarm, and a - shows 3777 again.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:30:06 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, [garble] that.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 285 hours, 16 minutes [260:29] Ground Elapsed Time. You heard the report from Ken Mattingly. We have a recurrence of yesterday's Program Alarm, this the Inertial Sub-System warning light on. At this point, however, the light remains on. We'll stand by and continue to monitor. We show Apollo 16 at a distance of 38,327 nautical miles away from Earth, now travelling at a speed of 10,000 feet per second.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:30:47 Hartsfield:</b> Do you still have the ISS light, Ken?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:30:51 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:32:13 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. We'd like to proceed with the malfunction procedure.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:32:19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Would you like to do Block 6 again?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:32:31 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken. They're looking at it. There's speculation we've got a - the fail bit set and stuck there.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:33:17 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. Let's proceed with Block 6 and go on down to 12, and - but I think we're gonna see the same thing all over again, but let's try it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:33:26 Mattingly:</b> You say skip Block 6?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:33:28:Hartsfield:</b> Negative. Let's do back - Block 6 again.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Block 6 is the malfunction procedure which was followed yesterday when a similar kind of problem developed. We're at 285 hours, 20 minutes [260:33] Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:33:33 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:33:51 Mattingly:</b> Same thing, Hank.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:33:53 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, understand.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:34:35 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. I'm not sure how to answer Block 6. I'll go to Block 12 if you like.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:34:41 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by a minute, Ken. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:35:28:Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We can see that input channel bit, and it's set, and it's staying set, so we think there's no need to proceed any further.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:35:38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Do you have any way of isolating whether it's - the bit is set or whether it's receiving continuous input?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:35:47 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Everybody's looking at that now. We're trying to psych out what's going wrong here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:35:53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you, sir.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:40:47 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. It appears to us that the input channel bit just cleared. Did you do anything?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:40:54 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. And the ISS light is out.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>260:41:45 Young:</b> Let me tell you what the only thing we can think of that might have happened. Charlie's down in the LEB, and Tool E, it sounded like, got knocked against the Panel down there, if you can believe that.</p>

        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> That's John Young speaking from Apollo 16, now. We're at 285 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. As you just heard the Program Alarm just cleared. However, if the alarm light persisted, this does not mean that the Apollo 16 can't use the guidance and navigation system for entry. But if another problem developed with the Inertial Sub-System, we would not get the ISS alarm. What Apollo 16 would really be giving up would be an ISS fail indication, but we would receive a gimbal lock alarm or indication if this developed. We're at 285 hours, 30 minutes [260:43] Ground Elapsed Time. We show Apollo 16 at a distance of 37,095 nautical miles away from the Earth, and travelling at a velocity of 10,168 feet per second. </p>

        <p class="tech"><b>261:24:30 Roosa:</b> Oh, jolly good, there. I - I've got a couple or three changes to your checklist and your cue card, if you want to fish those out.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:24:41 Mattingly:</b> Okay, got the cue card and an Entry Checklist. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:24:45 Roosa:</b> Okay, let's go to the Entry Checklist, Page E/1-2.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:24:53 Mattingly:</b> Okay, E/l-2. You're starting early in the book.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:24:54 Roosa:</b> Oh, Roger. Okay, let's go down here to the - the end of the logic sequence check.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:25:06 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:25:07 Roosa:</b> Right after we've opened the SECS circuit breakers there, we want to write in "Battery compartment pressure check - Systems Test, 7-A. If off-scale high, open Vent Valve through entry." </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:25:41 Mattingly:</b> Okay, battery compartment pressure check - that's meter 7-A. If off-scale high, open through entry - and, just for your information, right now it's about 2.9.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:25:53 Roosa:</b> Okay; copy. Okay, and then at the bottom of that page, after the P52, put in - I'm sorry - let's do it before the P52. Add "Start EMP 509." And this is just an arbitrary point that we've - that we've picked, Ken. We're getting close enough now that we think we ought to have 509 running. We would prefer you to go ahead and do the P52 in SCS, as you have been doing. But let's just have 509 running before you go into that P52.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:26:38 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's fair.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:26:40 Roosa:</b> Okay, let's go over to 1-3 and ...</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:26:44 Mattingly:</b> All right.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:26:45 Roosa:</b> Down under the boresight - this is the standard bit - delete your "Verb 41 Noun 91," and add "Verb 16 Noun 91 Enter; use Manual Optics." </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:26:59 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Manual on the boresight.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:27:01 Roosa:</b> Okay. And now, after you drive the Optics to 90 degrees, we want to delete the Optics power, off. And we want to verify Optics Speed, Lo. And we're going to leave the Optics power on and, here in the mysterious world of glitches, this is going to minimize the probability. So we're gonna come in with it on, and we'll put the Speed to Lo just to hold down the drift.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:27:36 Mattingly:</b> Okay, after the 90-degree shaft, why, we'll - delete Optics power off and verify that the Speed is Lo.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:27:45 Roosa:</b> Okay, now let's go to 2-2. Thank you. I need to be looking at this instead of that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:27:53 Mattingly:</b> Okay, 2-2.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:27:57 Roosa:</b> Okay. Now, after we get down to - after the P61 entry prep and prior to entering P61, we want to add - and the - what we're doing here, Ken, is we're resetting the average-g flag, which we set in 509. And if we do not do this step - now this is a - a pretty critical step - if we do not reset that average-g flag, P61 will not call average g. So our procedure here before we go into P61 is a Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, Enter. And if for some reason P61 would not call up average g, your fastest and most obvious cue is that lack of the comp cycle before Noun 61 comes up. If you don't reset this, your Noun 61 comes up immediately, but - with 509 running, we've got to get this step in or we'll not pick up our average g.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:29:15 Mattingly:</b> Okay, That's a good one to know.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:29:17 Roosa:</b> Roger. And how about just reading that step back to me there.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:29:21 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Before calling P61, I'm going to reset the average-g flag with a Verb 25 Noun 7, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, and 0 Enter. And I'll do that prior to calling P61.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:29:33 Roosa:</b> Okay. Jolly good. And let's go over to 2-4.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:29:40 Mattingly:</b> Okay. On 2-4.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:29:42 Roosa:</b> Okay. And what we're doing here now is, after you have Pro and you activate the Entry DAP, at that time, your Noun 46 first digit is dropped to a zero. To reactivate EMP 509, after the flashing 06 61 comes up, let's insert in there a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter. And, of course, all we're doing here is putting the 3 back in Noun 46 and this was dropped, as I say, when you went into the Entry DAP.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:30:26 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The - you want to do that after - Line 13, or before that?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:30:32 Roosa:</b> Okay. After line 13, in between the flashing 06 61 and before the PRO.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:30:53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Stu, after flashing 61 and before Proceeding on that, we'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46, 30000 Enter.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:06 Roosa:</b> Roger. You'll do a Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:11 Mattingly:</b> That's right.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:13 Roosa:</b> Okay. And you got the picture of why we're having to do that?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:18 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:19 Roosa:</b> Okay. Now the - now, if you'll pick up your cue card, we'll change it to the same things that we've just gone over in the checklist here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:30 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:33 Roosa:</b> Okay. Prior to your P61, add Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, 0 Enter.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:52 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll reset that flag before P61.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:31:57 Roosa:</b> Okay. And, back down here in your P62 box, same thing we just talked about. Prior to the Pro, after the 06 61, add Verb 21 Noun 46 Enter, 30000 Enter.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:32:19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Got that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:32:25 Roosa:</b> Okay. And - got a - a change here to your Systems Checklist - and this is just changing to reflect the increased pressure in the battery compartment. If you'd like to change that, it's Page S/l-2, under Step 3.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:33:23 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:33:25 Roosa:</b> Okay. Down - toward the bottom of the page, about three lines up, we've got a comment in there. "If greater than 1.5, Battery Vent valve, Vent." We want to change that 1.5 to 3.4.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:33:55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We change that to 3.4.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:33:58 Roosa:</b> Okay. It's a pretty innocuous change. And the one - the line right above that, too - "Systems Test 7-A, battery compartment pressure less than 1.5," change that to 3.4, also.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:34:09 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:34:10 Roosa:</b> Okay. Those are the changes, Ken. And - we're working up a - a list here. It'll be pretty straightforward. I don't want to give them to you now. We're massaging them - of the cues that will indicate to you - the CDU glitches just prior to and during the entry phase. And I'd like to talk to you about that in a little bit when we get all squared away.
        <p class="tech"><b>261:34:38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:34:40 Roosa:</b> Roger. Oh, I'd like to also add here, Ken, and - of course, as you well know, we - in this mysterious glitch solutions, we gotta shotgun it, and we're trying to find the areas that are a prime candidate for glitch in the CDU. And one of these is during your GDC align procedure, when you have your Att Set switch to Att Set and you either switch in to or out of IMU on the Source. What you're doing here is loading up the CDU's, and they feel that this is a prime candidate for a glitch. So, our words of wisdom are to minimize the number of times that you use this switch, and I guess after your GDC align in the normal checklist;, we'd kind of like to see you not cycle that Source switch to IMU with your Att Set switch in Att Set. I guess you could still check your GDC versus Noun 20s if you wanted to, but I did want you to be aware of this particular switch combination as - as loading up the CDU. And this is where we have the probability of glitches.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:36:07 Mattingly:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:36:09 Roosa:</b> And just ...</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>261:36:10 Young:</b> As you know, we've - we've only aligned the GDC IMU a thousand times, and I don't think that's had anything to do with the glitch we've had so far.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>263:26:56 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Looks like we're between - just before doing the P52. Go ahead, Stu.</p> <a name="263_27_04"></a>
        <p class="tech"><b>263:27:04 Roosa:</b> Okay. This deals with the - our favorite problem, of course, the - your ISS warning. And, right now, you people are doing all the right things and we're wanting to do those same procedures right through - right through entry when, of course, when ISS comes on, I'm sure you're going to go to Spacecraft Control, which you've been doing and you've been checking that alarm code. And we're saying that, if you have that 3 triple 7, to ignore it. Whe - it's - whether it needs it or not, just to keep the procedure straightforward, we - after you - while you're still in SCS, do a Verb 40 Enter and wait your 10 seconds, and go back to CMC. So, this means that we're saying - we'll come all the way in CMC with that 3 triple 7 alarm showing. If you do get a - if you do have a CDU failure, why, you will see it in your - in your bank angle - your - which is just your normal procedures there where you're looking at your commanded DSKY angle versus what the spacecraft is doing. Also, if you have got a glitch in the CDU, such as we got on the way out, and it's not the 90-degree bit - of course, if the 90-degree bit is set, you'll have the gimbal lock telling you that. And it's again the same old bit, SCS, Verb 40, wait 10 seconds, back to CMC. You can get some glitches, of course, in the CDUs that are not the 90-degree bit. I mean, there's a possibility of it. And, just some words on that - if - if the - if it's a low angle bit set, I say less than 30 degrees, you - it really does not affect your target point. I mean, we're talking in the order of being very close to nominal, within a mile or so. If - if the bit set is large enough for you to see it, comparing the - I mean if the bit set is gonna affect your splashdown point by any appreciable amount, you'll see it comparing your commanded angle versus where the spacecraft is going. So, that's your clue. And, if you see this and it's not looking right, we want you to go to SCS, do a Verb 40, and back to CMC to see if that solves the problem. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>263:30:02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That all sounds reasonable.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>263:30:05 Roosa:</b> Okay. And I guess the - I guess this - about the only thing I'm saying, Ken, - that's any appreciable difference is this Verb 40 bit. I'm not used to doing that during the entry and I'd like to emphasize that if you're not - if it's looking funny and you're not sure, well, go ahead and do it. And, of course, as you well know, the needles will zero and the DAP will be off for 10 seconds, and you'll be back in business. There's one other point, and I'll admit this is - this stretching pretty - pretty thin, but we're trying to cover all the angles. If it's prior to P64, where you're going along - Of course, if you're in CMC control and you get a glitch, why you'll get the response from the DAP. If you're going along in SCS control and you get a glitch, why, your needles will go out. Now, you may have your pitch needle already pegged. So there's - here again, we might have a glitch in that pitch needle - in the pitch CDU and not know it. So, just one other recommendation is if your pitch needle doesn't come off the peg the way you like it, why, let's try a Verb 40 before we would say the - the G&amp;N is not doing correctly.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>263:31:25 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>263:31:39 Roosa :</b> And I guess that about takes care of it, Ken, John, unless you got any - Charlie, unless you got any questions. It'd probably be John punching up the - the alarm there and, if you do get the 3777, why, let's reset it and press ahead. And, of course, any of the other triple-7 alarms are - are valid. And - but, of course, it's the same old monitoring bit. You're going to see how she goes. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>263:32:14 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Stu. I think that's all pretty well understood. Thank you very much.</p>

        <p class="ed">[Ken Mattingly, from JSC Oral History Project:"Then after floating around and you realize that you’ve gotten so used to things, just set them out there. They’ll be there. You don’t need anything. All of a sudden there was a preference that 6 things kind of disappeared that way. Then the spacecraft would just kind of rock a little bit. You’re not feeling any Gs, but the spacecraft would rock, and you’d hear the jets try to fight it. So then they would come back in further, and then you started finding that, yes, indeed, you were laying against the couch now. As the g forces built up, you’re looking aft from the direction you’re going. Looking out the window, you started to see little color, light blue wisp, like a gas stove. It’s coming from around the side, and you see it as it goes off, because the gas is being ionized on a heat shield back here, and it’s flowing around. As the gs build up, this little wisp becomes a light until it gets so bright that I was tempted to put my hand up over the window so I could read the instruments. The instruments aren’t really well lit, but I was really putting my hand up here over the window so that I could see. It was this bright white light, and as the g forces eased off as you penetrate the atmosphere, the light went to dim until it kind of all went away."]</p>

        <p class="ed">[Ken Mattingly, from JSC Oral History Project: "Hit the water, rolled over. The procedure to get it right-side-up worked. One of my least favorite things was the emergency procedure for getting out upside-down. So, man, the swimmers were there, and they put the collar around the spacecraft. You’re really feeling just a sensation of elation. The swimmer had a beard, standing on his little raft outside the hatch. We opened the hatch, and I had gotten us there because I was &quot;Mr. Hatch.&quot; I opened this hatch, and I didn’t know what he was going to say, but something, and the next thing I know, this thing goes &quot;Wham!&quot; and it’s right back in my face. &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; I opened it again, and the guy said, &quot;Sorry.&quot; Okay. So we got out, put us in the chopper. We got back. They brought the spacecraft aboard and set it on the flight deck, went in and got cleaned up. I thought, well, I’ll go up on the flight deck and see what—I had this thing that, by golly, I’m going to walk around as much as I can before anybody sits me down and says I can’t. So I go up on the flight deck and see the swimmer team was up there. I recognized—I said, &quot;What happened out there with the hatch?&quot; He says, &quot;You don’t know?&quot; I said, &quot;No. What’s the matter?&quot; He says, &quot;Let me open the hatch.&quot; And the odor was unbelievable. Thank God our olfactory nerves disappear early in life. Living in a bathroom for ten days is not a desired position. Life magazine doesn’t tell you about those things. Boy, was that terrible."]</p>

Now Captain John Young, the commander of Apollo 16.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Young:</b> It really is great to be back. I think I have to say thank you to four different groups of people today. I'm not going to make a long speech because that isn't my nature. But I've been working with a couple of guys for about two years, they've always demonstrated [that] they're clever, intelligent, resourceful and all the good words. But in the last 10 days on a mission where kind of critical things had to go just right where we had some rather difficult problems and rather minor problems, Ken and Charlie, performed an outstanding manner. Their professional cool courage and discipline in situations which required time critical button punching, stick throwing, switch pulling, was tremendous and they also exhibited a cool, professional courage in situations where they were involved in some personal risk, I feel. So to them I would like to say outstanding, for your performance. For the benefit of you Navy guys that's a hardy well done. The second group of people is the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, in Houston, Texas and around the country, who did so much during our mission to make it go. We could tell by every message that came to us, that there had been a lot of people working all over the country to do their jobs. And by golly we appreciate it because we made that mission go, thanks to you. The third group of people, that nobody ever talked about much, is the American taxpayer, I think you taxpayers, we taxpayers, you got your money's worth on this one. You really did. You saw an example of go-oriented team work and action. The kind of thing that made this country great and the kind of thing that's going to keep it that way. You also saw and sitting right there in Casper right now a mission of discovery. There are secrets in that vehicle that nobody knows what is in there. There is some basic knowledge and understanding in that vehicle right now. We're going to find those things out and one of these days, it's going to benefit us all. I can guarantee you, I feel that if we hadn't done our mission we'd have been remiss in not uncovering this basic knowledge. And what I'm saying is that that basic knowledge is locked in those secrets. It's pushing back the last real frontier, the frontier of the unknown. And by golly that's essential to the survival of humanity on this planet. And the fourth group of people and maybe the people I feel more at home with than anybody is the good old US Navy, thanks for being here, cause I'll tell you right about now, Charlie, Ken, and myself aren't swimming too good.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Mattingly:</b> Well I don't want to make any speech. I never thought a group of all males could look so good. But you sure do. We'll fix that in a short time too. But thank you very much for doing a very professional job and to all the people back in Houston, and the rest of the NASA team, I hope they get a chance to come back and personally say thank you to all of you folks. You really did a bang up job. Thank you. </p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Duke:</b> It's pretty difficult for me to put my feelings into words right now. We've seen so much and done so much in the last 11 days, it's almost indescribable the beauties and the scenes you see. You don't think that, that one can be topped and then sure enough the next one tops it. Most clearest in my mind is the entry right now and that's hard to top. It's going to be a while to digest everything that has happened, but I along with John, would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to the four groups of people that he mentioned. Thank you again, everyone, it's good to be back and to be looking forward to seeing every one again. Thank you.</p>
