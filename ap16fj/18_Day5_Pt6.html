The Lunar Module on the surface is in a stableconfiguration, [and] everything looks good at this time.

      <p class="obcm"><b>105 48 14 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay, ifyou're listening, tape recorder, we're passing over King now. And -something I hadn't noticed before kind of unusual out here. There's alot of clumpy material all around King. The central peaks definitelyhave big blocks sticking up in them. The things that we've called darkmaterial are not dark, but rather they are big blocks that cast somepretty long shadows. They look like they're piled on top of some verysoft and unconsolidated material. But they are indeed big blocks on thecentral peaks. And - I'll also say that they're on - surprisingly,they're mostly on the eastern side, but there are some on the westernside. The floor of the crater looks like a big, big flow - lots of flowbands and things. In the crater rim to the west, it looks like there'sa definite textural change at the top; and it looks like it has a darkband and then a light band, then it goes back to the same old darkgray. This entire area has a large amount of light material around it.It is not entirely associated with - with the - the crater King. Itlooks like there's an area in - We've even come into some new swirls Ididn't know had existed, but I think they do. And I got a picture totake here. Well, I'll get a picture of them next time around. Let'slook for a topographic expression.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>105 50 51 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Where'd you go, you sucker? (Sigh) What'd that color wheel say I should have here? Let's see, 1/250- f/8.</p><a name="105_53"></a>

      <p class="tech"><b>105 53 13 Mattingly:</b> Hello, Houston. Casper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 53 18 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 53 22 Mattingly:</b> Loud and clear.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 53 40 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. We need barber pole plus three on the camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 53 44 Mattingly:</b> Henry, I'm gonna - Okay, barber pole plus three.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 53 58 Mattingly:</b> You have it. And would you remind me when you get about 30 seconds from Pan Camera to Stop.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 52 05 Hartsfield:</b> Will do.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 54 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 54 20 Mattingly:</b> I want to mark something on my chart, and then I'll talk to you for just a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 54 25 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 54 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And I put Battery A on Charge at 105:35.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 55 04 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 55 31 Mattingly:</b> I've got you out the window now; but it looks like half of you have gone away. It's all black.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 55 42 Hartsfield:</b> I hope we're in the sunny half.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 55 48 Mattingly:</b> Oh, I bet you're in the dark half. Aren't you? That shows how long it's been since you've been outside.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 55 56 Hartsfield:</b> It has been awhile.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>101 56 09 Mattingly:</b> As I came over, I finallygot squared away; and as came across King, I had the binoculars out.And, sure enough, on the central peaks down there - the things we'vebeen debating for so long about whether they were streaks or outcropsor what they were - are large blocks, which are on the - the centralpeaks. Most of the blocks seem to lie on the eastern side of the peaks;however, there are a few blocks on the western side - enough that youcan tell that the reason they look dark is they cast pretty longshadows because they're pretty huge blocks. The floor looks like it's -looks like an old mud flow. It's really a strange looking floor. It'sgot lots of flow bands and patterns in it. In the crater rim to thewest, on the interior shows at least three distinct shades of thisgray. The upper one is the same color as the surface, which is a light- sort of a darker gray. Then there's a light gray band, which runsparallel to it. And then the dark band again below that. And the lightband is, perhaps, a quarter of the depth of the crater wall. To thenorth and west of King, I ran into some things that looked like thesame sort of swirls we've been looking at up around Al-Birumi andaround Reiner Gamma. These two are in the highlands. And with thebinoculars, it's my impression that these probably have a certainamount of relief - topographic relief - with them. But they look - whenyou look straight down on them, they look exactly like the other thingswe've been looking at. And I took a quick picture of that thing, and Iput it on magazine Victor. And if you'll keep a record of these things,Ed[?], that one is on Victor at exposure - oh, excuse me, it's magazineNovember November; and that's exposure 41.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 58 23 Hartsfield:</b> We got that, Ken. And, Casper, could we get High Gain, Auto?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 58 37 Mattingly:</b> You've got Auto, now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 58 46 Mattingly:</b> And it's oscillating.Suppose I go back to - there it is. Okay. I had a little tone in myheadset that was beeping very softly, and the signal strength was doingthe same thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 59 09 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. You want to goBlock on the computer, Ken. And we show your Optics still in Manual.And, Ken, you're about ten seconds from Pan Camera, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 59 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The computer's in Block. Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 59 30 Hartsfield:</b> I was a little late with that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>105 59 35 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Okay. No sweat. We got it done. I'll check the Optics. And when you're ready, I'll start configuring the SIM bay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 00 03 Mattingly:</b> And, Hank, would you verifythat it's okay to take the Optics and put them to CMC - or to zerothem. I sure don't want to take any chances with it.</p>
      <p class="ed">[CM transcript ceases until 107:28:27]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 00 18 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. It's okay. They say nothing will happen.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 00 31 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, we've got a little trouble with the High Gain. We need to go back to Reacq.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 00 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm in Reacq. Want to go back to Auto now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 00 47 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by. Okay. Cleared to go to Auto.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 01 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Auto it is. You got a good one that time. And if you're ready, I'm ready to start deploying things here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 01 16 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. Would you stand by? We're waiting for OSO to get his data.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 01 24 Mattingly:</b> Oh, very well.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 01 39 Mattingly:</b> Dum-de-dum (singing).</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 11 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, while we're waiting here, how did your extend time go on the mapping camera?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 14 Mattingly:</b> I didn't time it that time, Hank. I - sorry.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 22 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 27 Hartsfield:</b> Casper. Pan Camera Power, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Pan Camera Power is Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 36 Mattingly:</b> Mark it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 44 Hartsfield:</b> OSO has his data now. We can proceed with boom deployment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 03 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We button this up. Okay, the first one you'd like is a - how about a mass spec for 61 seconds?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 04 13 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 04 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Going to Deploy...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 04 20 Mattingly:</b> Mark.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>106 05 40 Mattingly:</b> Gamma ray is going out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 06 34 Mattingly:</b> Gamma ray is stopped.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 06 39 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. And could you give us barber pole plus 4 on the Map Camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 06 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That should be one more step. Right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 06 48 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 06 52 Mattingly:</b> All right. You've got it. Okay, now the Mass Spec experiment is going to On. The Ion Source is going to Standby.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>106 09 43 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, for your information we're planning on your retirement - to rest that is, at 109:30, the nominal time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 09 52 Mattingly:</b> I'm glad you clarified that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 10 02 Mattingly:</b> I hope you realize I'm too young to retire.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 10 05 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 10 14 Mattingly:</b> Can you tell me anything about the status of the surface guys? Are they gonna get at least two EVAs out of this?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 10 28 Hartsfield:</b> I think the plan is now,Ken, for two EVA's. They are busy buttoning up the LM now and gettingready to get some sleep. They're gonna move the EVA times - at leastthe first one's gonna be tomorrow morning about 10:30 Central, I think.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 10 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 10 48 Hartsfield:</b> And we're gonna change our shifts around too, so I'll be on again in the morning, and then Stu'll get it in the afternoon.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>106 13 47 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Okay. That's gonna take some bookkeeping; I'll work on that. Sure would rather look out the window, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 13 59 Hartsfield:</b> Did anybody ever give you some words on the undervolt last night?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 14 07 Mattingly:</b> Yes. The words we got werethat I inadvertently attempted to get the pan camera on the same timethe heaters all came on and - I guess the transient was just - just toomuch.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>106 17 53 Mattingly:</b> Henry, another thing thatturns out to be a - a pretty nice little gadget is these nets that arein the stowage compartments.

      <p class="tech"><b>106 18 22 Hartsfield:</b> So those are working out real good, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 18 26 Mattingly:</b> Yes, it sure is. That's been a very - help.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 18 42 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken you don't have toacknowledge. Look our plans are in the morning first thing to give youa clock sync and get back into the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 19 42 Mattingly:</b> That sounds like a good plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 21 09 Mattingly:</b> Oh, one thing you've got tobe careful of up here is - when you go to look outside, you kind ofhave to watch it because you get your - you get too greedy and you getyour nose up against the window. About one breath is all it takes, andit's all fogged over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 21 25 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. I understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 21 27 Mattingly:</b> I think our humidity must be running fairly high.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 21 37 Mattingly:</b> I'm passing over a nicelittle guy right now and would guess - on, I haven't been paying anyattention to where I am - looks like I must be - probably looking thethe north at - somewhere around the - Guts - Gutenberg uplands. And I'mpassing over a little crater that's got another large fill in thecenter and nice big crater in top of him, a little crater chain aroundit. And as I said earliest, everything out here has this linear patternor these lineaments and it doesn't matter whether it's a flat surface,a horizontal, vertical, inside of a wall of a crater - they all seem tohave it in one form or another.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 22 35 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. if - if our plot board up here is right, you ought to be in - coming up on landing site.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 22 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let's see.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 23 03 Mattingly:</b> Oh, maybe I'm out the wrong window here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 23 34 Mattingly:</b> You're right, Henry.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 24 28 Mattingly:</b> And, if you'll rememberthat little black dot that we drew on our map and talked about. There'sa little black spot about in the right area, and I don't have my map soI just looked out at it. But I'll come back next time and take a lookand - sure like it is something - entirely different texture.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 24 48 Hartsfield:</b> Are you talking about right in the area of the landing site?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 24 53 Mattingly:</b> In the - in the landingsite area, but not in the landing site - traverse regions. But thatlittle dark thing looked like a - a possible cone that was out to the -north and to the west. There's a little black dot out there that lookslike there may be something that's - that is distinctive. And next timeI come over, I'll be better prepared to look for it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 25 19 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I remember that one, that was in the edge of the plotter, wasn't it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 25 26 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 26 56 Mattingly:</b> I tell you, it sure isimpressive how much - how much the scenery changes as the Sun anglechanges and how rapidly that goes down.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 27 43 Mattingly:</b> Your plot boards show me over Albategnius, you say?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 27 46 Hartsfield:</b> Say again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 27 50 Mattingly:</b> Does the plot board show me over Albategnius?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 27 54 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 27 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now let me tell you alittle something here. Just to the north and mostly to the west ofAlbategnius, the ground - and I think in the higher Sun it's going tolook like - look a lot like Imbrium sculpture but not here. It has themottled effect and the same appearance that the Descartes area had atthe same Sun angle yesterday. And that's almost directly south of -it's a little south and a little bit to - of Ptolemaeus, and it's alittle bit to the east of Alphonsus.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 28 49 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. You ought to be coming up on a terminator now. Is that right? Pretty close to it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 28 58 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. My view is disappearing rapidly.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 30 03 Hartsfield:</b> You should be over Ptolemaeus now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 30 43 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, for your information, everything in the SIM bay is looking good now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 30 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I just saw somethingthat - I really don't know what to make - I'm in the - I think thespacecraft is just about in the dark, but not quite. We've passed theground terminator, and I'm looking out of window number 3 down towardsthe ground. I'm trying to get a preview of what's coming in earthshine.And there's a bright flash that's going along out there. At first, Ithought there was something that was on the deck, but it's apparently apiece of debris that's in orbit with us. It's sitting there, tumblingover and flashing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 31 43 Hartsfield:</b> It's traveling along with you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 31 46 Mattingly:</b> It moves across the ground, so it must be a piece of debris. Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 32 15 Mattingly:</b> As a matter of fact, I look around now and there's quite a few of those.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 32 21 Hartsfield:</b> Can you get any idea how far away they are...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 32 48 Mattingly:</b>... Depends on what effectthat has on - no I can't, Hank. It's just a piece of something that'sout there, and it's tumbling so that it gives you an occultingreflection. No field [feel?] at all for it, but it's moving inapproximately the same velocity that we are.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 33 02 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, in reference to yourobservations of Crater King, we got some ideas about those swirls thatare northwest of King. And we'd like for you to get a comparison ofthose with the swirls of Ibn Yunus. And I wonder if those also havetopographic expression?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 33 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm too - I'll haveto do that some other time, because today I'm too far south to seethose things up by Ibn Yunus. I can just barely see up to Neper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 33 39 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 33 43 Mattingly:</b> But we sure need to keep that in mind.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 33 46 Hartsfield:</b> And another thing youmight be thinking about if you get an opportunity on some round is toget us a description of the area north of Crater King, including theSoviet Mountains.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 33 58 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. I was thinking oflooking at that. I really hadn't planned to spend much time on Kingthis time. I was going to just kind of look at the - look at the olecrater there. But, got so interested in it that - it looked likethere's another crater that's just to the east of King that has, say, alittle bisected, central feature just like King. You know the thingthat makes that - that little Y-shape. And it looks the same way.That's kind of - kind of interesting, I thought.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 34 44 Hartsfield:</b> Yeah. I guess we hadn't seen that in the photos.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 41 58 Mattingly:</b> I guess, Hank, I ought to be passing Flamsteed now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 42 05 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That looks right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 42 12 Mattingly:</b> It's really impressive how much you can see in the dark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 42 27 Mattingly:</b> I don't believe you can seeas much now as you could last night. Of course, partly we're - I'mhigher now than I was when I looked at it last night. And the Earth isnoticeably smaller, so I guess it's getting - it's losing it'sreflective ability rather rapidly.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 42 52 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 42 55 Mattingly:</b> I was also very impressedwith the way you could see the - the LM outline in earthshine. That wassomething I had not anticipated. Last night as we came across - welllet me see what it was - it starts with an H - over on the western rim.Hevetius. Yeah. We drove across that last night, and you could reallysee the floor patterns in that beautifully.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 44 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. Let's see. I owe you a crew status report from this morning. Right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 44 56 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 45 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let's see if I can give you that thing now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 45 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Alfa 1, 22047; Alfa3, 6; Alfa 4, negative. Bravo 1, 15044; Bravo 3, 6; Bravo 4, negative.Charlie 1, 21095; Charlie 3, 7; Charlie 4, 1 Seconal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 46 24 Hartsfield:</b> We copy, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 46 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now I'm going to try to go down the menus here. We're looking for Day 4. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 46 42 Hartsfield:</b> Affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 46 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. On commander, Meal A,you can delete the mixed fruit, and meal B, you can delete pea soup;Meal C, delete chicken stew and add a chocolate pudding. For me, youcan take Meal A and delete the mixed-fruit. You can delete the breadand Jelly. On Bravo, you can delete the pea soup, meatballs. OnCharlie, you can delete the chicken stew, and I guess that takes careof those things. The reason for so many of these - we all deleted thesecanned things, because we got them all over the spacecraft last time,and we decided that we really couldn't afford to do that again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 48 13 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 48 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And let me find Charlie's here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 49 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Here's Charlie's. Andon Meal A, you can delete mixed fruit and jelly. Meal B, you can deletesugar cookies. Meal C, you can delete the pudding and the chocolatebar.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 49 26 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 51 01 Mattingly:</b> Now we're coming acrossHevelius again, and I can see Grimaldi and a couple of fractures thatgo across its rim. You can really see a lot of detail here. You can seethe rilles, you can see - as everybody pointed out, the - they looklike ribbons that are just dropped down, and they go all the way acrossthe crater like Hevelius. And it looks like they go out from [garble],and they come down - in fact, they go all the way down to Grimaldi. Andjust before they get to Grimaldi, they run into a crater. And it lookslike they might have been filled a little bit. In fact, it looks thesame way that some of the rilles that dot the Fra Mauro, look likethey've been filled in. Then there is a very smooth patch that's linedup with this graben that runs from there to Grimaldi. No, I'm sorry.I'm calling Riccioli, Grimaldi. The crater I'm talking about now isRiccioli, and it's got quite a few fractures that run out. And it lookslike a flow pattern. It looks just like looking down on a - on a longtongue of lava like we've seen terrestrially. I don't mean to inferthat there is lava, but I'm just saying that it has the sameappearance. It is coming out of the northeastern corner of Riccioli.And it has what looks like little ripple patterns on it, like you'dexpect for flow bands, but they aren't quite as arcuate, and they don'ttake quite the same - the same concentric pattern that you'd expectfrom a flow front. But this little crater coming down from Hevelius -the rille it comes down to there and then it hits the crater, and thenit gets a very, very smooth spot. And then it runs in and you can seecontinuations of these lineaments right on across Riccioli.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 53 07 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That sounds real interesting.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>106 53 11 Mattingly:</b> Riccioli has quite a fewelongate little craters around it. Several of them that are - elongate- and one of them is quite long. I'd say it's maybe - it's curved andlooks like it's maybe ten kilometers long. And it has just a slight arcto it. But, it is a very elongate feature. Now, we are moving intomaterial that's very hilly and I don't see a lot of small craters. Idon't see a lot of bright ones. You can see bright rims in here quitewell. The things that do stand out to the west of Riccoli are the verydramatic cross cutting graben-type rilles. They cross, in one placehere, almost 90 degrees to each other. Looks like I am looking at avery subdued old basin. And, these things go across the hills and righton across the basin floor. And, I'm not sure, but I would guess thatsome of these things - other lineaments I am seeing - they're runningtoward the northeast or more than likely things coming out ofOrientale. I should be coming in towards the outer rim of the OrientaleBasin. You get-the same kind of impression of - at the terminator whenthe earthshine runs out as you do when sunshine runs out. The onlything it's different is you don't - you don't get to see quite as muchof the - everything is a lot more subdued. And, you don't get shadowsthat are nearly as long. Or, at least not as bright. There's also,running down here - there is one ridge and I am sure I am looking in aridge instead of a graben. I've got grabens and cut it. But this thinghas a bright line on it that looks like ridge that runs northeast,southwest along with some of the graben. And, it seems it's one of thefirst big ridges I've seen that cuts up over a highlands clump ofmaterial. That's all just to the - just to the west of Riccioli.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>107 28 27 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay; we're coming up on the crater Sharonov, and we're trying to catch up on the photo pass. And I'm aimed roughly between Sharonov and Anderson. And we'll fly along here until Spencer Jones, and the next time we have something coming up is an IMC change at [107:]38. Sharonov is a rather interesting crater. It's got a lot of big slumps that are in the wall to the east that you don't see, looks like the western wall. They're in the shadow, but they're very, very predominant slumps, some with little craters. They look very smooth and rounded. In fact, they - the walls to the south look smooth and rounded compared to the - to the walls that are lighted by maybe a sunlight illumination effect. There's a - across the Moon, now, we see several different kinds of material, and there doesn't seem to be any exception. We see Cayley-like material which is - this altitude, is anything that has lots of little pits and relatively smooth surfaces. And coming up now on Spencer Jones. And we see that this area out here has a - a lot of gently rolling topography. You see streaks of it, and then - well, I see some little hummocks, and then I see it going out to smoother areas. I'll try to compare this with the - with the Cayley. I see several places where there's little clusters of holly [?] cratered area. I see there are more craters than the - the average that you would expect.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>107 30 58 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Shifting to 1/250. 1/250 I shifted to at Spencer Jones. I'm shifting a little later because it's a rev later. Spencer Jones is again another one of these strange ones that looks like it's slumped. It looks like it's been here forever with slumps in it. They're all around it. They don't have sharp terraces anywhere. I have the impression that within the material that comes from Spencer Jones down - down into Pap - Papaleski is even smoother, and it looks like it flows down in there and just creeps over it. And this is true all over the north - excuse me, the northeast and also the southwest side.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>107 32 01 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Take a quick look down in there. Back to our strip.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>107 32 23 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Apparently some of these things I'm looking at north of Papaleski there that they're unnamed on our - our chart, but look like they're just filled with so much stuff, big blobs of things that couldn't all be slumps that just fell down from the side, but they'd almost have to run in to form the kind of blobs that they have. There's one here that - It's a little to the north. It's a very strange looking thing.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>107 33 30 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Man,everywhere you look there's craters and craters and hills. Hummocks upon the northern horizon. Let's get one shot of that stuff. Okay. Well,I guess that I'm not coming up on Van Gent. And I guess it's about timefor me to shift to - to an f/8.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>107 34 59 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Man, there's more of that stuff. It's just all over here. What looks like areas have just flown down into these big ditches.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>107 41 37 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Well, got alot of smooth floor areas that slump and come right up over thiscrater.

Got alittle ripple to it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>107 42 28 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Ha! There's definitely a dark albedo unit that comes down through here. I don't think I understand.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>107 42 51 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Boy, it sureshows in the binoculars as an entirely different texture. When you lookat it, it doesn't look surprisingly so much. Just to the north - justto the northeast of Green, there is a distinctly different texturedunit that shows up. It looks like a flow. It's just spread out inthere. And it does indeed look distinctly different. The terraces inGreen are large banks, but there's no evidence of bedding in them. Theyjust look all slumped, except for some little patches every now andthen, flat places. And one little spot looked that like it had a dark -block on it or something.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at107 hours and 59 minutes, and at this point, we have caught up with allof the back-log of tapes that was accumulated during thechange-of-shift press briefing and which continued to pile up on us aswe were replaying the tapes that we had already accumulated. We are upto date now and standing by live, and we believe that third good night,or at least hope that third good night, was the final one. We don'texpect to hear from the crew now for about eight hours aboard Orion. Weare in contact with Ken Mattingly aboard the orbiting Command Module -Command Service Module, Casper; and we'll be picking that up andstanding by until Ken Mattingly completes this revolution and goesbehind the Moon, and we expect he also before much longer will begetting a rest period. Based on the data received from the Lunar ModuleGuidance &amp; Navigation System during the landing, we have come upwith a set of landing coordinates which agree very closely with theestimation that John Young gave of the Spacecraft's position. Ourcoordinates from the calculations here on the ground show the LunarModule Orion to be located about 430 feet [130 metres] west and about900 feet [270 metres] north of the planned target point. If I remembercorrectly, Young estimated that they had come down about 200 meterswest and about 100 meters north of a crater very near the landing site,and that crater was Double Spot Crater, which is just slightly to thesouth and west of the LM site. So the two numbers would be verycomparable. The numbers that I gave, the 430 feet west and 900 feetnorth are with respect of the landing site - the numbers that Youngused. His estimate was 200 feet - or 200 meters, rather- west of DoubleSpot Crater and 100 meters north, which is about the same location, asbest we can tell, as that we have computed. The coordinates of thislanding point would be 8 degrees, 59 minutes and 13.2 seconds south and15 degrees, 30 minutes 48.6 seconds east. We do expect that thesecoordinates will be updated, particularly if Ken Mattingly is able toget some tracking data from orbit. Using the CSM sextant, he plans totry to take some landmark sightings on the landing site and will alsoget an additional fix based on crew observations once they get out andget a chance to look in a little more detail at the surroundinglandscape. At this point, we'll switch over to our second air-to-groundline and stand by for any conversation with Ken Mattingly aboard theorbiting Command Module, Casper.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>108 17 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Papa Papa is out and loaded. I'll try to pick up Descartes to Andel with it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 17 24 Roosa:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 22 07 Mattingly:</b> Stu, there is a definite textural similarity between the material or the bright spot by Descartes Crater and the things around Stone Mountain. However, it is a lighter albedo. It's a shade lighter and the line of demarcation seems to come along the long crater.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 22 38 Roosa:</b> Okay. We got that.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at108 hours, 21 minutes. We have heard no nothing further from the crewaboard the Lunar Module Orion, Charlie Duke and John Young since welast said good night. But we do have about 40 minutes of acquisitiontime left with the Command Module, Casper, which is presently in anorbit 66.8 nautical miles [124 kilometres] by 53 nautical miles [98kilometres]. And occasionally we are getting bits and pieces driftingthrough the communications of what sounds like Marshall music that KenMattingly is playing on the onboard tape recorder. And as the levelreaches the high enough point that is triggering his vox, the voiceoperated relay and the communication system and we'll get a snatch ofit here and there. Mattingly at the present time is getting caught upon his normal flight plans and we expect he will be caught up by about109 hours, 30 minutes at which time he's scheduled to begin an eightand half hour rest period. At present time he's involved in keeping theSIM bay operating and taking a series of photographs. And at about 109hours, 17 minutes he is scheduled to start in on the pre-sleepchecklist. We'll continue to stand by live for conversation between KenMattingly and CapCom, Stu Roosa. We'll be in a record mode for anyconversations with the Lunar Module and we'll play those back followingtheir receipt. Should we hear anything from Young or Duke aboard theLunar Module (Music)</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 23 48 Mattingly:</b>And another strange sight over here, I think it's Andel, that's whereI'm supposed to be ending the strip. But there's another crater herethat looks like it's flooded, except this same flooded material seemsto run up on the outside. You can see a definite patch of this stuffthat's run down inside an old crater. And that material at least layson top of it, but it lays on top of things that are outside and higher.It's a very strange operation. I guess we'll have to wait and letsomeone that knows what they're talking about look at the pictures.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 24 25 Roosa:</b> All righty, Ken. Sounds real interesting.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 24 31 Mattingly:</b> Man, this is unbelievable.It's really something. Everywhere you turn, there's something new. Andlet's see if we can get in the old SS on Ptolemaeus here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 26 13 Mattingly:</b> Well, I'll tell you what. I'm going to have to skip Ptolemaeus. The terminator is still on the rim.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 26 22 Roosa:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 26 23 Mattingly:</b> Just for kicks, though, I'mgoing to show you one on frame SS that is really fascinating. And I'mjust on the eastern rim of Ptolemaeus. I mentioned it last time. I'mgoing to take a little strip of these.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 26 44 Mattingly:</b> And then see if I can get -yeah, that ought to be good enough. Okay, I took - I took it up to 20frames, and I used about five of these on SS. And what I took it of was- This material that's on the eastern rim of Ptolemaeus has the sametextural appearance in the - low that we saw in the Descartesformation, that being the stuff coming from the crater Descartesrunning north yesterday. An entirely different appearance than the restof the terrain in the low Sun. I think there may be some interestingcomparison there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 27 32 Roosa:</b> Okay, Ken. Got that. And you're approaching 30 seconds to - the...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 27 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay, going to end up pan camera off here somewhere.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 27 45 Roosa:</b> Roger; on my mark, you'll be 25 seconds.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 27 49 Roosa:</b> Mark. And, Ken, just turn thecameras off there. Then, before you continue on with those steps, Iwant to say something about those procedures on down at the bottom. I'mshowing 6 - 7 seconds.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 28 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 28 14 Roosa:</b> And -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 28 15 Roosa:</b> Mark. I show T-stop. That's the pan camera and mapping camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 28 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay, they are Standby andOff. I'll wait 30 seconds before I take the Image Motion, Off. Hey,thank you, Stu, that was a big help.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 28 30 Roosa:</b> Roger. And - I would - We'regoing to delete, on those procedures there, the Mapping Camera,Retract; and the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Close -We'regoing to leave those out all night, and we'll have a - a plan tomorrowon how we're going to handle the mapping camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 28 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You do want the Laser, Off, though. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 28 55 Roosa:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 29 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay, the Laser is Off now. The Mapping Camera going to Standby and the Image Motion is coming Off.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>108 29 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Those batteries kinda put in a day's work, too, today.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 29 36 Roosa:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 30 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I see that we'regoing to have AOS on the next pass before we get - before the sleepperiod starts, so I think I'll wait and give you my film summary atAOS, if that's okay. It'll take me that long to sort it all out, I'mafraid.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 30 23 Roosa:</b> That's okay, Ken.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>108 32 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 32 33 Roosa:</b> Okay I got a couple of things.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 32 35 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 32 36 Roosa:</b> Ken, one is we would like todelete that film status report. We would like for you to start yourrest period just as soon as you can after LOS and let us pick up anytalking about the film or anything like that for tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 32 54 Mattingly:</b> Oh, very well. You is the boss.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 33 00 Roosa:</b> And another thing, we're noticing indications here that your screens - on your O<sub>2</sub>return hoses and also the suit circuit return valve. You might take alook at those tonight and see if they need a little cleaning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 33 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I've been cleaningthe suit circuit return screen every night and it's been getting prettydirty, so I'll check it again today and the other hoses, I've got a -since I didn't have a screen for the inlets, I capped the inlets andjust used the outlets to keep stuff from - We got so much junk here, Ididn't want to get stuff inside the hoses down through the suit fansand to clog up the other filters...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 33 43 Roosa:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 33 44 Mattingly:</b>... So I put theinterconnects on the inlets and just let the air blow out of the hosesand take it all in through the suit circuit return. That might give youa little higher pressure rise.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 33 57 Roosa:</b> Okay, we - we concur with the configuration and but we have noticed the O<sub>2</sub> flow creeping up slowly, indicating that it would probably need a little housecleaning on that screen.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 34 10 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir; thank you very much. I'll catch that baby.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 34 13 Roosa:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 34 15 Mattingly:</b> I'll tell you, this is - A man shouldn't get paid for doing this.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 34 20 Roosa:</b> Yes, it really sounds great,Ken. I think - I think the difference in the Earth crescent sure mustmake a difference, the way you're talking of earthshine versus the wayI saw it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 34 32 Mattingly:</b> Oh, it's fantastic. You cansee the whole thing. It's really something. I'm going to try that -that's the reason I wanted to try and get these earthshine pictures inthis time before the Earth gets any smaller. Because it really isn'tnearly as dramatic tonight as it was last night, and I don 't knowwhether that 's the altitude or what.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 35 01 Mattingly:</b> But if I - let's see, wewant to run these booms out and what else? Got to turn the Pan Camera,Off. Okay, if you'll give me a call on those.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 35 11 Roosa:</b> Roger. I'm watching for you on the boom deploy, Ken. You got a little less than 5 minutes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 35 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll - You knowsomething else that I'm not real sure about. It sure looks to me asthough the earthshine is not as bright on this mare. I guess it's justthis mare that's over around Fra Mauro and so forth is just darker, andmaybe it's my night adaptation that hasn't taken affect yet, but I gotthe distinct impression that that band's [?] a lot brighter when youget over to the western limb.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 35 52 Roosa:</b> Okay, got that, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 35 57 Mattingly:</b> I don't think I understand that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 36 17 Mattingly:</b> I tell you, I thought thiswas kind of appropriate here. A few minutes ago, I was playing Berlioz'Symphonie Fantastique and looking at this fantastic sight and floatingalong here, and it's just unbelievable it's so much fun.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 36 31 Roosa:</b> Yes, it sure sounds like it; infact, we were catching a little of your music occasionally there.Didn't sound as good as (laughter) Riding Old Paint", but I guess it'lldo.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 36 47 Mattingly:</b> Well, I've been listeningto "Old Paint" kind of music for three days of PTC. But it was good"Old Paint," I'll have to admit. I enjoyed it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 37 12 Roosa:</b> And, Casper; Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 37 15 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>108 37 19 Roosa:</b> Okay, would - What we'd like to do now, Ken, is go ahead and put out the booms now and, as soon as you have them out, go ahead and start the - start your P20 running right now.

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at109 hours, 2 minutes. We've had loss of radio contact now with Apollo16 Casper, as the Spacecraft went around the corner on its eighteenthrevolution. And when we reacquire in about 45 minutes, Ken Mattinglyshould either be in his sleep period or about to begin. We last heardfrom the crew aboard Orion on the lunar surface at 107 hours, 53minutes, or a little over an hour ago, and they should be in the midstof an eight-hour sleep period at this time. We have an additionalupdate to the landing coordinates for Orion based on the crew'sout-the-window observations and report of the terrain features thatthey were able to see out the window. Our best estimate now is thattheir actual landing site - Landing point - is 656 feet [198 metres]west of the target point and 459 feet [140 metres] north.

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 114 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. At this time I would like to repeat our previous announcement that Flight Director Gene Kranz has just completed a status discussion with [the] flight control team. A first cut preliminary flight plan has emerged. Our present plan is to shoot for the three EVA's, each of about seven hours duration. EVA 1 is set to start at 119 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. EVA 2 start time [is] 141 hours, 43 minutes GET. And EVA 3 about 165 hours, 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Each of these EVA's would be separated by [a] rest period of eight hours in essence. Surface activity would be flopping back to Apollo 15's tight schedule. The traverses for John Young and Charles Duke would be much like th[ose] planned pre-mission taking into account the later landing time. If this plan continues to hold good, the lunar liftoff will be at 177 hours, 28 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Needless to say the consumables outlook for Apollo 16 is favorable. The closest consumable item aboard Orion is water in the Descent system. And this is five to six hours above the three EVA margin and even this could be increased if needed by cutting down electrical power or using from the Ascent system to the equivalent of eight hours. In summary our outlook to this point is good. We show our wake up clock in Mission Control shows one hour, 36 minutes till time of wake up and our Ground Elapsed Time 114 hours, 17 minutes. Continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
