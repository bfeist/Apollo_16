      <p class="pao"><b></a>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 94 hours, 21 minutes into the flight of Apollo 16. Less then a minute away now from acquisition of data and voice from the spacecraft. Coming around now part way through the eleventh lunar revolution. The communications with the two spacecraft have been split at this time, that is a separate CapCom or spacecraft communicator. We'll be talking to Ken Mattingly aboard Casper. Ed Mitchell is the Command Module CapCom. Jim Irwin remains as CapCom to communicate with Young and Duke aboard Orion. During this eleventh revolution, we have Acquisition Of Signal. Let's stand by for communications with Orion.</p>
      <p class="ed">[Although we have two different CapComs, the transcripts do not differentiate between them until after 094:44. After that, the Technical Transcript separates out the communications between MCC and the CM and MCC and the LM. However, before then, it is not possible to determine with absolute confidence which CapCom is speaking, except when the Apollo 16 crew address the CapComs by name. The transcript will simply identify the speaker as "CapCom" until 094:44.]</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>094 23 14 Duke:</b> Okay, Jim. We're zipping right on through the checklist. We've got the PGNS up, the docked coarse align done, the landing gear's deployed, and the only thing we haven't done is really what you need to see. And we're ready to start in on the S-Band checks and bring up the steerable. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>094 23 34 CapCom:</b> Okay, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>094 23 43 Duke:</b> Okay, while guidance is - Let me give you some angles. We had a Verb 06 Noun 20 that was done at 94:20:20. The LM angles were plus 29465, plus 28996, plus 35502.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>094 37 59 CapCom:</b> I think it was about the same, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>094 38 05 Duke:</b> Okay, be advised - we went through the steerable Step 2 on Page 3-62, and the yaw still does not indicate that it's moving, and we cannot hear a grind. Though, with those angles, I get a - that I got of 99 and minus 12, I get a signal strength of greater than 3. I went Track Mode to Auto and Up-Link - and when I went Track Mode to Auto, it sounded like the thing is setting up there just constantly oscillating and the - the pitch needle varies plus or minus 10. The signal strength stays pretty constant. In fact, no matter what position I select on the S-Band antenna, the signal strength stays up around 38 or so. </p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. We've had loss of signal toward the end of the Eleventh lunar revolution of Apollo 16. Still docked at this time, however, by the time that the two spacecraft come around the front side of the Moon again at the start of the 12th revolution they will have undocked. I have a schedule of Ground Elapsed Time of 96:13, about four minutes, correction six minutes prior to first acquisition on orbit number 12 as the spacecraft went around the corner. Duke and Young were conducting the Reaction Control System hot fire checks aboard Lunar Module Orion. There has been some difficulty in getting the steerable S-Band antenna on Orion to perform - particularly to yaw to the proper settings for providing good communications to Earth. However, for Revolution 13 which is the landing revolution we will have the 202 foot, 210 foot [64 metre] large communications dish at Goldstone, California in acquisition of the spacecraft and all the high bit rate data, voice and all of the forms of communication with Orion can be handled through the omni antennas, provided we do have the 210 foot antenna. There was some imbalance between Reaction Control System regulator pressures between Systems A and B; that was the reason why the crew was instructed to open the cross feed to allow some of the propellant from System A to go into the Ascent [Stage] propellant storage tanks. The propellant is not lost in this operation. It merely is transferred to another tank. Also the crew is instructed to use System A only for the RCS hot fire, also to take some of the load off of the RCS System A. We're some 45 minutes away from acquisition in revolution Number 12. At LOS, Apollo 16 at [sic] an orbit measuring 10.3 by 58.9 nautical miles [19.1 by 109.1 kilometres], and at 95:32 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 95 hours, 45 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Some 31 minutes away from acquisition of Apollo 16 as it starts around the front side of the Moon on orbit number 12. To summarize the apparent problem with the Lunar Module steerable antenna, if by the time of power descent and landing the problem has not sorted itself out and the antenna is, indeed, out of commission, right now, it appears that the crew cannot get the antenna to rotate in the yaw movement. It will be possible for all data in voice, high bit rate data, to be relayed to Earth through the Omni antennas starting with revolution number 13 which is the landing revolution. The 210 foot antenna in Goldstone, California will be the prime site. There's no apparent concern here in Mission Control with the potential loss of the steerable antenna. Some mention as been made of the fact that the meters that indicate antenna position sometimes fail or hang in the one indication, when actually, the antenna is properly rotating, but over the next two revolutions, this situation should sort itself out. At any rate, loss of the antenna does not mean that the landing will be aborted. We're still in a Go situation. And at next acquisition, the two spacecraft, Casper and Orion, will have been separated by some six minutes prior to acquisition. 28 minutes now until Acquisition Of Signal from Casper and Orion. At 95:48, this Apollo Control.</p>
