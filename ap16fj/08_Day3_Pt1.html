      <p class="tech"><b>045 59 11 Young:</b> Houston, Apollo 16. Good morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>045 59 56 Young:</b> Houston, how do you read Apollo 16? Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>045 59 59 Peterson:</b> 16, you're loud and clear. How me?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 00 03 Young:</b> I read you the same. Good morning to you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 00 07 Peterson:</b> How are you doing this morning?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 00 10 Young:</b> Doing great.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 00 22 Young:</b> I guess that sort of depends on what y'all can say about the old platform.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 00 27 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p><a name="046_00_37"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 00 37 Peterson:</b>Okay, 16. The gimbal lock and the coarse align that you had back at 38plus 18 [GET] was caused by a CDU transient in the yaw axis. The transientwas induced when the TVC relay was disabled. And this relay is normallyenabled when the Optics is in Manual and disabled when you select P00,and that's kind of the situation that you're in when that occurred. AndKen had just selected P00, and he had, prior to that, been using theOptics in Manual. And they say that this type transient has beenobserved in CSM 117 [Apollo 17] testing, and we're presently looking at- a software work-around for LOI. And we'll get some more words to youlater on this - on this same subject.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 01 26 Young:</b> Now you're talking. That's the best news I've heard today, so far.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 01 41 Peterson:</b> Okay. And, John, we've had some problems here getting commands up to the bird - real-time commands. And we've got a command test we want to run. And - we'll be standing by. As soon as you can get ready, let us know and we'll get into it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 01 58 Young:</b> Okay. We've got some seat flops to do and we'll let you know.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 02 05 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>PAO</b> This is Apollo Control. 46 hours, 1 minuteGround Elapsed Time, and about 30 minutes early, the, or ahead of thescheduled wakeup time, the crew has called Mission Control. We have afew seconds of accumulated tape caught unawares. Then we will rejointhe conversation with the crew of Apollo 16 live. Let's roll the tape.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 02 36 Peterson:</b> 16, in the situation we'rein now, we've only got one omni that we can read, and we can't command.So we're only getting about 11 minutes of low-bit rate data out ofevery 18 while you're in PTC. It's possible - we might lose you; if so,just stand by and we'll pick you up again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 02 57 Duke:</b> Okay. We're ready for that command test, Pete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 03 02 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 03 12 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie. We're gonna go one step at a time. First thing we want to do is Up Telemetry, Command Reset and then Normal. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 03 25 Duke:</b> Okay. I can give you - You want a Command Reset and then Normal? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 03 32 Peterson:</b> Charlie, we want the Up Telemetry Command switch to Reset and then Normal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 03 42 Duke:</b> Roger. It's Reset, Normal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 03 48 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie. Stand by. We're gonna try some command.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 04 09 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie. Thatapparently didn't work. We're going on in. But we want to cycle the UpTelemetry switch Off for three seconds and then back to Normal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 04 22 Duke:</b> Roger. In work.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 04 30 Duke:</b> Okay, you're back to Normal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 O4 35 Peterson:</b> Okay. We're trying commands now, Charlie. Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 04 52 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie. That apparently cleared it up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 04 59 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 05 03 Peterson:</b> And, Charlie, we've got commands again. We'll handle the antenna and the bit rate for you now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 05 09 Duke:</b> Okay, fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 05 21 Peterson:</b> To repeat an old phrase,Charlie, we had a lot of people down here turning blue on this - untilthat - until that last little situation got cured there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 05 32 Duke:</b> Was that that IMU problem?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 05 35 Peterson:</b> No, the - the - comm problem.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 05 39 Duke:</b> Well, you could put Fendell in the backup mode and just put him up on top of the building.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 06 01 Peterson:</b> We may have to put him up there anyway, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 06 06 Duke:</b> (Laughter) Afraid so.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 18 50 Peterson:</b> 16, Houston. I've got aboutthree - a couple, three updates to the Flight Plan. Whenever you're -it's convenient for you, we'll read them up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 36 08 Mattingly:</b> Don, you about ready for a little status report?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 36 14 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 36 19 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. We're all set. Go ahead. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 36 44 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. We're all set.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 36 45 Mattingly:</b> Houston. Casper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 36 52 Peterson:</b> Casper Houston. How do you read me?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 37 10 Peterson:</b> Casper Houston. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 37 32 Peterson:</b> Casper Houston. How do you read me?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 38 19 Peterson:</b> Casper Houston. Do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 38 37 Mattingly:</b> Houston. Casper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 38 39 Peterson:</b> Casper we read you loud and clear. Do you read me?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 39 07 Peterson:</b> Casper Houston. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 39 20 Mattingly:</b> Houston. Casper. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 39 24 Peterson:</b> Casper we read you. Do you read us?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 40 09 Mattingly:</b> Houston. if you're readingCasper, we're transmitting in the blind. We have signal strength on themeter of about 60 percent. We're not receiving you and, based on yourcomment about the antennas, we'll wait about five minutes and then tryagain before we change the configuration.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 40 43 Peterson:</b> 16, you're loud and clear. Do you read Houston?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 46 08 Peterson:</b> Casper, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 46 15 Mattingly:</b> Roger. We lost you there for a while there, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 46 19 Peterson:</b> Roger. You're loud and clear now. Do you read me okay?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 46 24 Mattingly:</b> Loud and clear.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 46 26 Peterson:</b> Roger. You were loud and clear all the time. Apparently, you just lost us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 46 53 Peterson:</b> And, 16, the comm problem may have been on the ground. We'll try to find out and let you know in a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 47 09 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 47 19 Mattingly:</b> The background tone at the- the background noise that the system is making right now is a littledifferent than it was making before, if that would help you figure outwhat the problem was. It's almost like it wasn't up-linking, maybe.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 47 38 Peterson:</b> Roger, 16.</p><a name="046_47_43"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 47 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don; and, if you're ready, I'll give you some status reports.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 47 48 Peterson:</b> Stand by just a minute, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 48 14 Peterson:</b> Okay, Casper, go ahead with your status report.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 48 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm using that famousold trick on how to get someone to talk to you, by every time I pick upa juice bag and get halfway down, why it seems like we are able toestablish comm. So I'll start with the Commander's list and I'll gothrough and I'll skip the menus since they're on separate pages andcome back to them. So let's start with A-1: 22035; Alfa 3: 7, good;Alfa 4: none; Alfa 5: 19, 15, 18; Alfa 6: 6, 5, 6, and 3. That's atotal of four. Going to Bravo. Bravo 1: 15035; 6: good --that's onBravo 3. Bravo 4: none; Bravo 5: 10, 30, 25; Bravo 6: 2, 2, and 5.Charlie 1: 21059; Charlie 3: 7, good; Charlie 4: none; Charlie 5: 15,30; Charlie 6: 7, 7, 5, 5, 5. Okay, and if you want the menu stuff,I'll go back to that now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 50 36 Peterson:</b> Okay, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 50 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. For John, and that'sday 2, Meal B, scratch the bread and peanut butter. On Meal C, scratchthe frankfurters; add an orange drink.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 51 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay, on Bravo 2. Are you still there, Don?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 51 58 Peterson:</b> Affirmative; we're getting a lot of background noise. 16, hold off a minute...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 52 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay, [garble] keep on going.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 52 04 Peterson:</b> ... we'll switch omnis [garble] Hold off a minute, 16; we'll switch omnis.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 54 19 Peterson:</b> Okay, Casper. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 54 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay, just a second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 54 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay, starting on - Where did you copy last?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 54 44 Peterson:</b> Okay, we got John, day 2, Meal Charlie complete, and we're ready, I guess, for Bravo.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 54 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Bravo 2. On Meal A, you can scratch sausage patties and - orange juice - and fruit cocktail.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 55 37 Mattingly:</b> On Bravo, that's Meal B,you can scratch turkey and gravy, vanilla pudding, bread, peanutbutter. Meal C, you can scratch the chocolate pudding.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 56 13 Mattingly:</b> Going to Charlie 2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 56 16 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 56 19 Mattingly:</b> On meal A, scratch thesausage patties. Meal B, you can scratch the bread and peanut butter.Meal C, you can delete two of the frankfurters and scratch thechocolate pudding.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 56 40 Peterson:</b> Okay, Casper, we copied all that.</p><a name="046_56_46"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 56 46 Mattingly:</b>Okay, and a couple of other words here on the - We got ALFMED comingup; and, to date, Charlie saw some flashes the other night and not awhole heck of a lot of them last night. And I'm not sure I have seenany at all yet, and John may or may not. So, what we thought we'd dohere is - We've got a little more house cleaning to do here and finishour chores. And we'll probably take a look at what we see, and ifCharlie is seeing sufficient - you know, enough flashes that he'spretty sure he's seeing thing, why, we'll go and run the experimentnow. And if we aren't seeing a sufficient number to look like itjustifies sitting here for an hour with it, why, what would you thinkabout saving it until such time as it looks like maybe we see more ofthem?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 57 45 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. We'll - we'llthink on that a little. And also, I've got a note on the Nikon cameralight meter here in connection with the ALFMED photography.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 58 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay, stand by another second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 58 15 Peterson:</b> Ken, you don't really needto copy much, I think. If you've got the camera handy there where youcan look at it, I can give it to you in a few words. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 58 24 Mattingly:</b> You know one of the things we need in this program is some octopuses.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 58 29 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 58 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don, I don't have thecamera out, but how about just reading to me whatever it is you want tosay. I'll write it down here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 59 05 Peterson:</b> Okay. It's not - it'sprobably not worth writing down except maybe a little note to remindyou the - the camera was observed to hang up in the Battery Checkposition full down, when you hit the camera light meter On, Check. Andwhat we want you to do is - the little button on top of the camerathere has a while band around the base of it - they want to make surethat white line is visible on the light meter switch button. If it'snot visible, you can take your fingernail and catch the top of thatbutton and pull out on it until the white line is visible. And then,verify that the meter is operating by holding the camera up to a lightand observing the meter response to varying light level.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 59 53 Mattingly:</b> Roger. We'll make sure it works before we use it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>046 59 57 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. That's all I've got on that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 02 44 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>047 02 50 Duke:</b> Roger. Flash, with a hot report here. Pass on to the chefs that the grits were delicious.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 02 59 Peterson:</b> Say again, Charlie. I didn't copy that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 03 04 Duke:</b> I say, pass on to the chefs that the grits were delicious.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 03 07 Peterson:</b> Roger; will do. And forKen's information, the status report that we just got was excellent asfar as format, readability, and everything. The - Doc said he reallyappreciates it.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control.47 hours and 27 minutes into the mission of Apollo 16. Crew awake now,presumably conducting either the ALFMED experiment or beyond the eatperiod. As a matter of fact, part of their first activities afterwakeup was the status report, which [lists] all the parts not eaten;in other words, negative reporting on the meals for the three crewmenare read down. Also the problems with the commanding through the omniantennas have cleared themselves up, with the crew cycling a switch Offto back On again, which cleared the logic in the switching circuit. Andeverything is properly working now in that area. As soon as the crewcompletes the current housekeeping activities, the trouble shootingprocedures for the inertial measuring unit and the Guidance and ControlSystem, Guidance and Navigation System will be read up to the crew, andthey'll pursue that problem. As a little aside to the crew food report,Charlie Duke, a good southern boy from South Carolina, said "pass on tothe chef that the grits were delicious". Grits having been packed inthe menu on his request. Present distance of Apollo 16, 157,253nautical miles [291,233 kilometres] out from Earth. Velocity everdecreasing as we near the cross over point. Now 3,396 feet [1,035metres] per second. Total spacecraft weight still 102,890 pounds[46,670 kilogrammes]. We're continuing to leave the circuit live byground noise and all, as we anticipate resumption of communicationsbetween spacecraft communicator Don Peterson, and the crew of Apollo16, for the day's activities. This is Apollo Control at 47:30.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>047 35 44 Young:</b> Houston, based on the burn yesterday, is the data you gave us for the SPS burn card still going to hold for LOI?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 35 55 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 36 00 Young:</b> And the other question is, does it look like we're going to have another midcourse, and which one and how much is it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 36 07 Peterson:</b> Okay, we'll get back to you in a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 36 12 Young:</b> Okay, thank you, Pete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 36 41 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. On the burn card,we will probably have to do some more updating, we'll get to thattomorrow. And on the midcourses, Midcourse 4, right now, is - lookslike it's less than one foot per second. If it gets much bigger, we'llprobably do it. But we'll advise you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 37 04 Young:</b> Houston, 16. You're breaking up badly. How do you read us? Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 37 16 Mattingly:</b> [Garble], Pete, you probably read us loud and clear in the [garble] mode [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 37 15 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead, Houston, [garble]. Say again on all [garble] on the burn card.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 38 08 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16, if you read. Weprobably will have to do some updating on that - on that pad. And we'lllet you know on that and we'll update it tomorrow.

      <p class="tech"><b>047 38 43 Mattingly:</b> Houston, your up-link keeps fading in and out on you.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>047 39 17 Young:</b> And I read you same. You faded cut on your last transmission again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 39 23 Peterson:</b> Okay, hang on a minute until the comm clears up a little bit and then I'll come back to you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 39 29 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 39 44 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. Let's try itagain. On that updating the pad, we'll get that to you tomorrow. Andright now, Midcourse 4 looks very small, less than one foot per second.If it gets larger, we will probably do it, but we'll keep you advisedon that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 40 01 Young:</b> Outstanding.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 40 16 Young:</b> Just to review that SPSpressure system - as near as I can make out, it's purely - we don'tactually have a Delta-P. It's just - of about more than five psi. Whatwe do have is a gage difference. Is that not correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 40 41 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative, John.There's a - there's a chamber in there - a reference chamber that'ssupposed to be at atmospheric pressure. It has apparently vented to avacuum condition, which brings in about - about a 14.7-psi bias. Thenthere's a 5-psi meter bias on top of that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 41 01 Young:</b> Okay, so actually, the two meters, as we look at them now, are actually balanced. Is that not correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 41 08 Peterson:</b> I believe that's correct.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 41 12 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 41 20 Peterson:</b> John, the actual pressures on both meters - the actual pressures are the same, although the meters are reading differently.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 41 29 Young:</b> Okay, we got the message.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>047 44 01 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. Will we need to charge Battery B, just looking ahead in the Flight Plan a little bit? </p>

      <p class="tech"><b>048 00 53 Peterson:</b> Can you tell what part of the Earth?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 00 54 Duke:</b> We've got a half-Earth. Say again?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 00 58 Peterson:</b> Can you yell what part of the Earth you're looking at?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 01 03 Duke:</b> Well, we got half-Earth, and wesee a land mass - see the North Pole - the north polar cap with two bigswirls coming out off of it to the southwest. I can see the subsolarpoint very distinctly. It's a big white dot in the center towards theLM, away from the terminator. And there's a big land mass that'svisible in the center. And - can't really make out exactly what it is.It's clear of clouds, though. It's the only place that's fairly clear. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 01 44 Peterson:</b> Okay, we show you directly over North Africa. And that's just about the terminator.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 02 00 Duke:</b> Okay, you got North Africa at the terminator?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 02 04 Peterson:</b> Just about.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 02 06 Duke:</b> Okay, that's what it is, then,looking at it, yeah. It's - it's Africa. Looks like a good storm systemup in the Atlantic Ocean and above the subsolar point.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 02 18 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 02 45 Duke:</b> The blue coloring - the white ofthe clouds and the blue of the ocean, Dick. Things just stayed prettyconstant as we move out - still really a spectacular sight.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>048 07 13 Peterson:</b> I guess we'll give Ken credit for that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 07 24 Young:</b> Darn right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 08 31 Peterson:</b> 16, let us know what you think about the number of light flashes and whether or not it's feasible to try the ALFMED.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 08 40 Young:</b> Okay. That's in work right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 08 43 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 08 44 Young:</b> That is, if you can work on seeing flashes.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>048 08 56 Young:</b> That's a low metabolic load.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>048 19 49 Young:</b> Okay,Houston. We're going to start on the ALFMED now. I guess it'll take usabout an hour and a half from the time we start to the time we finishup.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 20 02 Peterson:</b> Okay. And you think you are seeing enough light flashes to make it valid?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 20 07 Young:</b> They haven't gotten around to doing that yet, but they're working on it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 20 12 Peterson:</b> Roger; understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 20 13 Mattingly:</b> Don, Charlie saw some thismorning when he got up. And so we're going to put the ALMED on Charlie.And we will not turn it on until we start to see some flashes, and ifwe don't see any, we'll just terminate it. We'll wait some reasonabletime, and we'll talk it over with you. We'll tell you when we're readyto go through it. That's our present plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 20 39 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken, we'll be standingby. And, Ken, while I'm talking to you, we've got a little moreinformation on this platform problem and its a fairly big mouthful, so,sometime when you get a chance when you can copy some information, giveme a call. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 21 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. it looks like it'll be a couple of hours.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 21 03 Peterson:</b> Roger. We don't want you to get into another P52 before we have time to talk about it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 21 10 Mattingly:</b> All righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 21 18 Duke:</b> Pete, (clear's throat) a little background on these flashes [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 24 02 Peterson:</b> 16, Houston. We missed your comments on the light flashes. You'd started to give them to us, and you were blocked out by noise.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 24 13 Duke:</b> Roger, Pete. I was just tellingyou - the first night - during the first sleep period, whatever thatwas GET, I saw numerous light flashes before going to sleep, probably a- as freq - as high as three or four a minute. The next morning, theywere not as numerous as that, and then last night still not asnumerous. This morning, I was perhaps seeing maybe one every couple ofminutes or so. If that frequency repeats itself during this test, isthat good enough to go ahead?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 24 50 Peterson:</b> Stand by one, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 25 03 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie. If you see one every minute or so, that's enough to go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 25 09 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 01 Peterson:</b> And, 16. At 48:30 in theFlight Plan, there's a line that says "Synchronize mission timer to CMCclock," and it is not required.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 11 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 12 Mattingly:</b> Oh, that's great. Thankyou. Hey, Don, is our comm gonna be good enough the way we're goinghere now for you to get the marks or are we gonna - shall we count onrecording them on board too? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 28 Peterson:</b> You better record on board as well.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You'll start the tape recorder, is that affirmative ?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 25 39 Peterson:</b> Affirmative. Call us when you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 41 Duke:</b> Or you want us to do that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We'll do that; thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 26 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay, if at any time, thevoice quality goes down, our procedures, as I understand themdescribed, will - I'll knock off or I'll take Charlie's place here, andI'll knock off the observations and go to recording. And other thanthat, Charlie will be doing all the things that I was going to bedoing. But, if you want us to record them in pen and ink at the sametime, just give us a call.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 27 20 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>048 36 51 Duke:</b> Okay, Pete. I just got the ALFMED on and in position, and we're gonna see if we see anything.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 36 58 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 53 33 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>048 53 39 Duke:</b> Okay. I've seen five in 15 minutes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 53 42 Peterson:</b> Five in 15 minutes, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 53 46 Duke:</b> That's affirm.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 53 50 Peterson:</b> Okay. Stand by a minute; we'll look at that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 53 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. We were justabout ready to call this thing off and try it another day. And thenlooked like Charlie was starting to see them at - at a pretty fairrate. That five in 15 minutes was like four in the last minute or so.And John has seen one; I have not seen yet. But sounds like Charlie isgonna be able to see these and I'm gonna go ahead and take thephotographs and get - get all set and wait for your answer.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 54 26 Peterson:</b> Okay. We've been advised that we do want to go ahead with the ALFMED experiment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 54 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It's in work. I'll tell you when we're ready to start timing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 54 37 Peterson:</b> All righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 54 41 Duke:</b> Okay, Pete. They seem to come in clusters. You get one or two right after - and then - then nothing for a while.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 54 50 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 58 07 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Don. Can you help us[garble] record our [garble] 12 [garble] 0.15, 1.2, [garble] at threefeet shows Charlie in the ALFMED with his face sticking out. I'm takinga picture from the LEB looking up towards the center couch. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 58 40 Peterson:</b> 16, that was so garbled we didn't copy, so you're gonna have to say it again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 58 45 Mattingly:</b> Did you copy that, Don?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 58 47 Peterson:</b> Negative, Ken. We were in - had a lot of background noise, and we didn't get any of that.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>048 58 55 Peterson:</b> Casper, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 59 00 Mattingly:</b> Did you copy comments about the film?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 59 02 Peterson:</b> Negative; we did not. We had too much background noise. Can you say again?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 59 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess I'll write it down. I think that's faster after all.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>048 59 13 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>049 08 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Houston. We're ready to start. Could you make sure the tape recorder is running?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>049 08 58 Peterson:</b> Ken, it's been running awhile. We're going to rewind it, and I'll get it back to you in a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>049 09 12 Peterson:</b> In the meantime, Ken, if you've got comments we'll take them on air-to-ground.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>049 09 21 Mattingly:</b> Does that mean you want us to go ahead and start?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>050 18 54 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 18 58 Mattingly:</b> You're cutting out pretty bad, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 19 03 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 28 05 Peterson:</b> 16, the PI advises on theALFMED experiment that we got about 70 counts, and he's very happy withthe results, and he wants you to verify that the clutch is in the Stowposition.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 28 19 Mattingly:</b> That's a verify.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 28 23 Peterson:</b> Roger; thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 28 24 Duke:</b> Okay, great. Those things -those things are really something, Don. There were a couple of thephenomena that I had seen previously that I didn't see today, but therewere some other ones today that were different too. The phenomena - theflashes leave no afterglow and they're - they're just instantaneous.All the colors are white - were all we saw. We saw no colors at all;neither John nor I. It was - every one we saw was white.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 28 55 Peterson:</b> Roger, copy that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 32 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. I'm ready to copy some things now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 32 22 Peterson:</b> Say again, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 32 23 Mattingly:</b> Before we get into copyingstuff, let me confirm what Charlie said about that clutch. Now Ilistened to that thing retract before, and as soon as we went to themid-position on the clutch - why, you can hear the plates come down.And we went ahead and rapped it once, anyhow, just to be sure, but Ididn't hear anything jiggle. And we cycled it to Operate and then backto Stow, and it all felt normal and the - the plate travel soundedproper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 32 56 Peterson:</b> Okay, we copied that, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 33 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and I guess my onlycomment on ALFMED is that I think those light flashes are made by thesame guy that makes the emperor's clothes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 33 08 Peterson:</b> That makes what?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 33 13 Mattingly:</b> I think they're made by the same guy that makes the emperor's clothes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 33 17 Peterson:</b> Roger; understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 34 19 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Don, I'm standing by to copy - the words you got about P52s and G&amp;N and any of those other subjects pertaining to our operation.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 34 28 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken, I'll - we'll talkabout the platform problem first, and I'm gonna back up and talk aboutthe original data that we passed up because there are some smallcorrections to that. And then I'll - I'll try to break it down intoabout four shovel-fulls here for you, because it's a fairly bigmouthful if we try to do it all at once.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 34 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You have some stuff that I probably should copy, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 34 54 Peterson:</b> Yes, I will have some items for you to copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 35 01 Peterson:</b> Hold off a minute, 16. We're coming up on an omni switch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 35 10 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 36 53 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. How do you read now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 36 58 Mattingly:</b> Loud and clear.</p><a name="050_37_00"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 37 00 Peterson:</b>Okay, we'll start here on this thing. First of all, the - the problemoccurs, apparently, in CSM-117 when the TVC relay changes state, eithergoing from enable to disable or from disable to enable. And it causesan electric glitch that makes the CDUs go to 90 degrees; in particular,the yaw CDU, and therefore the CMC thinks it's in gimbal lock and goesinto a coarse align mode. The - some of the cases that could causethis, for example, are when you go to - when you select Manual Optics,you have the TVC relay enabled and then if you go from Manual to Auto,or if you hit the Zero Optics switch with Manual Optics selected, or ifyou go from P52 to P00 with the Manual Optics selected, you will resetthe TVC relay, and that can cause the glitch. This is apparently whathappened last night.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 38 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay, is it important for me to copy those things that cause this, or are you going to give me a way to prevent it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 38 21 Peterson:</b> Negative. You don't have tocopy those. That's just background. Now we're going to talk about whatyou can do here in P52s and maybe subsequently in - for the LOIs andfor P40s. There are two ways to approach the P52. There's a - there's aquick and dirty way which is to simply go to SCS Control, because withSCS control, the TVC relay is not enabled. And, by doing that, youdon't run the risk of generating this glitch. That's not the way,however, that the guys are recommending, because they have a procedurethat they think will handle not only the P52, but the burn cases. Andthey'd like you to get that procedure, and you're going to have to copythat one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 39 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay. How about runningdown that list of things that causes the TVC enable to change stateagain? Let me - let me copy those this time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 39 23 Peterson:</b> Okay, will do. And - now -these cases are not all inclusive. These are just some examples that -that we can bring up to you. First of all, the TVC relay is enabledwhen you select Manual Optics. It is then subsequently disabled if yougo from Manual to Auto or if you go to zero the Optics with Manualselected, or if you go with Manual - with the Manual Optics selected,if you go from P52 to P00. But these are probably not the only cases;they're probably just some examples that we know of. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 12 Peterson:</b> Another important point, Ken, is that it changes state during the TVC gimbal drive check. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 22 Mattingly:</b> Yes, that's what I was afraid of. Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 24 Peterson:</b> Okay. We're going to - thisnext procedure that I have to read up to you is probably going to bethe one that we'll use to try to get around that. And also, we'd likeyou to use it in the P52s because it allows us to monitor for theglitch, and at the same time prevents the glitch from bringing yourplatform down.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 47 Peterson:</b> Okay, if you're ready to copy...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 48 Mattingly:</b> [Garble]...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 49 Peterson:</b> ...I'll read you up the procedures.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 51 Mattingly:</b> ...[garble] copy this or -Okay, I'll just copy this on a scratch pad, and we'll put it in theappropriate place, if that sounds reasonable.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 40 57 Peterson:</b> Roger. That sounds realgood. Number 1, we want you to key Verb 48 Enter and load Noun 46,Register 1. The first digit should be loaded as a 3. The rest of thenumbers can be left as they are.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 41 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay, why don't you read on at about that pace, Don, and I'll just copy, and then I'll read it back to you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 41 31 Peterson:</b> Okay, the second step is keyVerb 25 Noun 07 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, 1 Enter. That sets theAverage g flag, but does not turn Average g on. The combination ofthose two will prevent the CMC from going into coarse align. Afteryou've done that, you can select P52 and use your normal alignmentprocedures And, when you've completed the P52 to terminate this - EMP,we'll have you key Verb 48 Enter, load Noun 4 Register 1 with itsoriginal value, whether that was 2 or 1 in the first digit. Step 2,we'll have you a key Verb 25 Noun 07 Enter, 75 Enter, 1 Enter, Enter.That will then return your - you to the correct DAP and also reset theaverage g flag.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 43 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that - that was, in Verb 25 Noun 07, that was a 75 Enter, 1 Enter, and then zero Enter or a 1 Enter?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 43 26 Peterson:</b> Zero Enter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 43 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 43 32 Peterson:</b> Okay, that's the whole procedure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 43 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay, let me look it over here for a second. At first glance, the first thing I see here looks like - do I - should I [garble]?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 43 58 Peterson:</b> 16, we're switching omnis; hold off a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 45 50 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. How do you read now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 45 55 Mattingly:</b> Loud and clear.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 45 56 Peterson:</b> Okay. We lost comm there temporarily. You can go ahead now with the readback on that any time you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 46 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Did you get my questions about the Verb 46?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 46 09 Peterson:</b> Negative, but we have acaution note that says, "Do not key Verb 46 Enter while this EMP is into prevent Sap - Saturn DAP actually coming on."</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>050 46 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay, what you would dothen is - we're gonna set Saturn DAP in Average g in order to preventcoarse aligning in the event middle gimbal picks up spurious signals.And to do this, we set Verb 48 with a Noun 46. Digit A is set to a 3,and we set the Average g flag with a Verb 25 Noun 07, address 75, bit1, set it to the 1. Then we should call P52 normally, and if the glitchoccurs, it'll be ignored. I assume from this if the glitch occurs sometime while we're in the process of taking marks, that we get some kindof garbage out of P52, but it should be obvious. And from what you gaveme on this list up at the top, it looks like normally we would not runacross TVC Enable during that period. At the completion of a 52, we goback into a Verb 48, and now we take Noun 46 back to its originalvalues. Then we reset the Average g flag by taking channel 75 bit 1 toa zero, using Verb 25 Noun 07, and the restrictions on this EMP is thatwe will not use Verb 46 at any time while this is punched in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 48 04 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 48 12 Mattingly:</b> Okay, do you have some words on how - on how we handle the P40?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 48 30 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken, and - in the P40is what we're thinking about and we haven't completely decided now iswe probably use this EMP before and after the TVC gimbal check, and wemay move the TVC gimbal check earlier or before the burn so that wehave plenty of time to get this thing in and out. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 48 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that sounds like a good plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 49 00 Peterson:</b> Okay, now I've got the last shovel-full here if you're ready to copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 49 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I've got my bucket out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 49 08 Peterson:</b> Okay, if you should lose theplatform alignment, we'll do the same thing we tried last night, a Verb23 Noun 20 Enter, Enter, Verb 40 Enter, and then go to the checklist,G/7-1, and do the rapid IMU realign.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 49 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. If we tumble thething again, we're going to release the platform by setting Noun 20 to- to zeros, and we do that with the Verb 23 Noun 20 Enter, Enter. Thenwe release the platform with the Verb 40 Enter, and then we go throughpage G/7-1 and get a rapid alignment to the GDC. Now that - thatassumes that what happened to us was the glitch in the middle gimbal.If I understood your conversation, it's possible to have a glitch inone of the other gimbals. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 50 23 Peterson:</b> That's correct. That willnot, however, get you into the - into the problem that causes theplatform to go into coarse align. And also, we were advised that whilethis EMP is in, you shouldn't have the problem with losing the platformalignment. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 50 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay. If we - if we getthis glitch in one of the other axes - I - and we have the controlsenabled, I assume one of the things we would - we'd see would be someunusual thruster activity.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 50 58 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative, and in that case I guess all you need...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 51 00 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] proper correction. Well, I'm trying to figure out what we'd do if we have a - say we're in attitude hold. If we have that glitch occur right now and - with our engines disabled, I don't think there would be any way I'd see it until I went to use some auto optics or something. And that - if we were in an attitude hold, it appears to me that I would see a - a DAP that appeared to be unstable in the axis that it was going for, or at least it would take off for some place other than where it is. And we would go to SCS momentarily, and the proper response would be a Verb 40, Enter, and allow the CMC to zero and recount the IMU CDUs. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 51 50 Peterson:</b> Right on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 52 00 Mattingly:</b> This TVC enable that we'retalking about that's used for the gimbal drive test - now that's afunction only of the gimbal drive test and not a function of thesetting of the trims in P40. Is that correct? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 52 15 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 52 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay, so, our P40 thenwould be something like we would go out and we'll get a gimbal drivecheck to you folks early, then we'll turn the gimbals back offprobably, and I'm just ... what I'm [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 52 35 Peterson:</b> Omni switch coming up, 16. Stand by. Stand by, 16; we're switching omnis.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 52 46 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 54 19 Peterson:</b> 16, how do you read now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 54 23 Mattingly:</b> Loud and clear, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 54 24 Peterson:</b> Okay. Go ahead with your question.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 54 25 Mattingly:</b> I'm trying to give you myimpression of what we're gonna be - the general approach to the burn -and we check out the gimbal drives and the gimbal trims and then, whenwe come into P40 for the actual burn, we would go ahead and use the SCSgimbal checks to verify all the gimbals are properly hooked up. Then wewould bypass the flashing 202 with an Enter, and we'd just let thegimbals go to trim, and everything else would be done nominally.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 55 07 Peterson:</b> Ken, I think your generalimpression is right. I guess we're not yet ready to commit ourselves toa - a set of procedures. We're going to have Stu take a look at it inthe simulator here, and we'll come up to you later with some detailedprocedures specifically for the burn.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 55 27 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I understand that; I just wanted to make sure I had a general understanding in case we had to do some original thinking.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 55 35 Peterson:</b> Roger. I think we concur with what you said so far.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 55 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And the other thing,that out of curiosity - if the guys in the back room, after they getthrough getting all the important things squared away, that they couldkind of think some more about their list of things that causes thisenable relay to change state. I'll compile a list of those things incase we come across something later on that we hadn't thought about.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 56 16 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken, we'll do that foryou. And there's one last note here, that, prior to your P52s, it'd bea good idea to align the GDC just prior to going in .</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>050 58 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I 'm on page G/9-4,reading down column A. On line 7, I replace "77426" with "76747." Online 11, I replace "00214" with "77552." On line 12, I replace "77714"with 77756." Line 13, I replace "77446" with "77307."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 58 49 Peterson:</b> That's correct, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 59 10 Peterson:</b> And we've got, Ken, heresome notes on this jet-on monitor EMP. We'd like to do a check on it at54:25, and I can read you up the procedure for that any time you'reready to copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 59 24 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>050 59 27 Peterson:</b> Okay, at 54:25 in the FlightPlan, we would like to add "P20 option 5," in the "LM checkoutattitude'', Noun 78, minus 09000, minus 03000, plus 25500; Noun 79,plus 00050; Noun 70, plus 00047. We will up link the jet-on monitorloads and, when the P20 maneuver is complete, you can do a Verb 74Enter. And the P20 attitude that we've selected will be the attitudethat you're already in, so there is actually not a maneuver involvedhere.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 00 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay, when you say whenmaneuver complete, - does that mean that you would want us to maneuverto the LM checkout attitude using P20, or are you going to let us go toVerb 49 for that? And then, I'll call it up and bypass the maneuver, isthat correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 01 06 Peterson:</b> You can use a Verb 49 for that, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 01 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I understand. A Verb 49, and then we'll call P20, and then you can command the same attitude I'm in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 01 17 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 01 18 Mattingly:</b> In other words, I've got the 50:18 the second time. Then you want the Verb 74, Enter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 01 24 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. Coming up on an omni switch, 16. Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 03 24 Peterson:</b> 16, how do you read now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 03 29 Mattingly:</b> Loud and clear, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 03 31 Peterson:</b> Okay, the only other thing is at 56 hours, that's 56:00, we want you to terminate the jet-on monitor EMP.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 03 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay, can you tell me what dead band you are gonna be setting in there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 04 35 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken, it'll be a one-degree dead band.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 04 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you're setting me in the EMP at one-degree dead band; is that affirm?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 04 55 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 05 15 Peterson:</b> Ken, on the Noun 70, I read you a - a plus 00047. You actually don't need that plus; that's an octal number.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 05 25 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 05 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay, it's not clear to me- if we are going to exceed this or not; we normally would not. Do youwant to try letting us drift out of the dead band and see if themonitor works?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 05 55 Peterson:</b> Negative; that's - that's not the intent, I think. They just want to get the program in and look at it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 06 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, sometime beforewe get through, would you ask them if they would object to letting ussee if that thing triggers the same response that we're used to?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 06 16 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken; we'd like to think that over. We'll get back to you on that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 06 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay, fine. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 06 23 Peterson:</b> Okay. Now I've still gotthis note that we've had since about 24 hours ago on changing the angleon that Sun wheel and if you have that out now, we can clear that upotherwise, I'll hold it a while.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 06 37 Mattingly:</b> I don't have it out, butwhy don't you tell me what it is. I think I know what you're talkingabout. It's due to the REFSMMAT angles on there being changed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 06 44 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. And we (belch) inked "27 degrees" on it. We should have written in "37 degrees".</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 06 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It turns out we're at - is inked in at 27 and it should be 37.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 07 06 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>051 10 42 Young:</b> What's the probability of this - glitch happening? Is it about one in a million?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 10 47 Peterson:</b> Stand by 1</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 10 59 Young:</b> Say again, Pete. You cut out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 11 01 Peterson:</b> 16, I guess we really don'tknow the answer to that. That's one of the reasons we want to get thisEMP in to kind of watch for it and see if it's occurring frequently orinfrequently. Omni switch, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>051 11 53 Young:</b> Okay, Don, we're going to goahead and punch through this P52 and we'll start with our littleprocedure here, and you might kind of watch us through and make sure wedo it right the first time.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>051 13 34 Peterson:</b> I think we don't know theanswer to that, John. That's why we want to load this software programso we can monitor to see if that glitch is occurring frequently - or itmay never occur again, we really don't know.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>052 47 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I copied the Optics to Zero and the Optics Zero to Off when in CMC Mode control.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 47 21 Peterson:</b> Okay, and that was number 2.Number 3 is Spacecraft Control switch, SCS. Number 4 is THC, clockwise.Number 5 is Verb 37 Enter, XX Enter. Number 6 is fresh start, Verb 36.Number 7 is Verb 34 or PRO; in the sighting mark routine, R53 display.Number 8 is Auto Enter RCS DAP at SPS cut-off plus 2.5 seconds in P40.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 48 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I didn't understand that one, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 48 49 Peterson:</b> Okay. It's the - it's whathappens to you immediately following the burns. The SPS cuts off, andthen 2.5 seconds later in P40, the TV relay gets reset.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 49 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 49 18 Peterson:</b> Okay, and on the question of options, back up under set condition number 1, it's all options except number 2 in program 20.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 49 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 49 39 Peterson:</b> And that's all of them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 49 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and I understand that this - this can happen when you either set or reset the enable relay, is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 49 52 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. They say it can happen going - any change of state on the TVC relay. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 50 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Can you tell me ifit's the change of state of the relay, or just the command to change?For instance, if we already had it in some of these things like a Verb37, any program resets it; but if it's already in the reset position,is that a condition that's likely to trigger one of these things, or isthat one of the safe conditions? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 50 34 Peterson:</b> We - we think, Ken, it's the actual relay set/reset changing, not - not the command.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 50 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 51 20 Mattingly:</b> Don, let me read back whatyou read to me, and then I'll want to mull that over for a while andsee if I have any other questions.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 51 27 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 51 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and I think that, except the TV enable [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 51 43 Peterson:</b> 16, you're fading out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 51 53 Peterson:</b> 16, we are unable to read.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 51 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay, the things that willset the TVC enable are the Spacecraft Control switch to CMC, the OpticZero to Off, the Optics Mode to Manual, and the CMC TVC gimbal test inP40. These things occur only if I'm in P20 options 0, 1, 3, 4; P22,P23, P24, P52; and a Verb 41 Noun 91.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 52 29 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. On that, thefirst three of those constitute one set of conditions; and the lastone, that is, the start of CMC thrust vector control, is anothercondition that is sufficient by itself.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 52 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, understand. The first three go with those programs, and the CMC thrust vector control is sufficient by itself.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 52 57 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 53 01 Mattingly:</b> Did you - I don't rememberif we concluded whether that was when it - the CMC sets the gimbal inpreparation for the burn or only during that test. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 53 12 Peterson:</b> I don't think that's - at least, I haven't been advised as to which set of conditions we're talking about there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 53 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay, now I'll read you the reset ones.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 53 24 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 53 26 Mattingly:</b> It's Optics to Zero, OpticsZero to Off when in CMC Mode, Spacecraft Control to SCS, translationhand controller to clockwise, and Verb 37 Enter to XX Enter, a freshstart, a Verb 34 or PRO when in the sighting mark display, and the Autoengine off or AUTO TVC reset after a burn in P40.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 53 58 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. There are eight different reset conditions; number 2 actually contains two separate items.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 54 12 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. Can you...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 54 16 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 56 11 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. We're starting the fuel cell purge and waste water dump.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>052 56 16 Peterson:</b> Roger; Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 05 52 Young:</b> Houston, Casper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 05 54 Peterson:</b> Go ahead, Casper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 05 58 Young:</b> Okay, we've got a LM/CM Delta-P of 0.6. We'd like to go ahead and pressurize the cabin and then get ready for the LM entry.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 06 10 Peterson:</b> Stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>053 06 17 Peterson:</b> Okay, Casper. We copied, and you can go ahead.</p><a name="053_06_22"></a>
