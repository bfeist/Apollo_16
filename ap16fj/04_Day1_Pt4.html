      <p class="ed">[Apollo 16 has completed the Trans Lunar Injection burn(TLI) of the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V booster. The S-IVB nowholds only 2.75 tonnes of the 108.45 tonnes of propellant that it waslaunched with, the balance having been consumed to place the stage andthe attached Apollo spacecraft on the long, three day ballistic coastto the Moon. The 40 metre long, 65 tonne "stack" of booster andspacecraft is travelling at 36,360 kilometres per hour, but is slowingdown rapidly since it is still subject to approximately one quarter ofEarth's surface gravity. It will continue to slow down until the Moon'sgravitational pull exceeds that of the Earth, in about two days time.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[Inside the Command Module, John Young, Ken Mattingly andCharlie Duke are continuing to prepare to separate the Command andService Modules (CSM) from the conical shroud known as the SLA, in 20minutes time. (NASA sources of the time give varying meanings for thisacronym; either Service Module/Lunar Module Adapter as in the FlightPlan or, more commonly, Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter.) This willthen allow them to turn the CSM around, dock with the Lunar Module (LM)and extract it from the SLA. This is referred to as Transposition,Docking and Extraction (TD&amp;E)]</p>

When we were coming around out about30 or 40 feet [9 to 12 metres] out, we had a lot of white particles.Looked like it was coming out from around the Lunar Module. Quite anumber of them. And, as we got closer, it looked like to me that theprimary - most of the particles were coming bet - from between theascent propellant tank over quad one and this omni antenna. And itlooks like they was being jetted out from either some outgassing orsomething, and we assumed it's Mylar but are not convinced of that.</p>

Our space digital displayin Mission Control [is] presently using the Moon as a reference and weshow that Apollo 16 is 174,639 nautical miles [323,431 kilometres] awayfrom the Moon. At 4 hours, 37 minutes, continuing to monitor. This isApollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 39 52 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. Don't know if you can see it or not, but we've started the LOX dump on the S-IVB.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 40 01 Duke:</b> We lost it a little while ago, Gordy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 40 03 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control, Houston.4 hours, 40 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The booster systems engineer reports that the LOX dump has been completed with the S-IVB. We're at 4 hours, 41 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 41 07 Duke:</b> Houston, are you ready for us to start charging Battery B?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 41 17 Fullerton:</b> Okay, we're Go for the battery charge on B, and we'd also like you to dial in the Flight Plan high-gain angles, minus 47 and 98, and go to Reacq[uire].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 41 29 Duke:</b> Okay, you got the angles, and you're going to Reacq[uire].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 41 31 Duke:</b> Mark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 45 46 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 45 48 Fullerton:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 45 50 Duke:</b> Okay, we got Bat B charging, and it says volts should be 37� to 39�, and I'm looking at 33.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 46 04 Fullerton:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 46 25 Fullerton:</b> Charlie, we got - wefigured about 8 amp-hours out of that battery, so it'll be a while yetbefore the voltage gets back up, and EECOM thinks that's okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 46 37 Duke:</b> Okay, fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 47 22 Young:</b> Houston, we got 3.4 on 7A. We're gonna vent - we gonna vent the battery to zero, if that's okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 47 31 Fullerton:</b> Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 47 41 Fullerton:</b> We'd like you to hold on that a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 47 47 Young:</b> You're too late, we just vented it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 48 00 Young:</b> Okay, it's reading about 0.2 right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 48 05 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 48 06 Young:</b> Say again, 0.4.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control, Houston;4 hours, 50 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. The space digitals display isstill using the Moon as a reference. We presently show Apollo 16 at adistance of 172 - 173,082 nautical miles [320,548 kilometres] away fromthe Moon. Continuing to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 50 51 Mattingly:</b> Houston, got a couple of comments on the EMS for G&amp;C, whenever he has a break.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 50 59 Fullerton:</b> They're all ears; go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 51 03 Mattingly:</b> That must look funny. Okay.We been running null bias tests here for - well, since we got in orbit- each time the checklist calls for it. On the first one, we found thatin our hundred-second check, it gained 2.5; then, just before docking,it got 2.6; and I just ran another one, and I have 2.8. And I don'treally know what you can do with that, but I just thought I'd go aheadand tell you about that's the magnitude of what we're looking at.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 51 34 Young:</b> Okay, and our first rough guessas to how the SCS GDC system is performing, it looks like it's wellwithin spec in pitch, yaw, and roll, as far as its drift measurementsgo.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 51 50 Fullerton:</b> Okay, Ken and John, we got that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 53 15 Fullerton:</b> 16, Houston. Whenever you're ready, we're ready to load the PTC REFSMMAT.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 53 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you have P00 and Accept.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 53 28 Fullerton:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 54 19 Fullerton:</b> Ken, sorry about that. Wedidn't get coordinated here. We don't have an up-link site, so go backto Block until after 5 hours, and we'll try it again then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 54 29 Mattingly:</b> All righty. They're back inUpTel to Block. And we're going to be kind of hanging up here for awhile anyhow, while we get our suits off. It - it turns out to be apretty interesting operation with these new B-suits.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 54 46 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b><a name="004_54_50"></a>004 54 50 Mattingly:</b>I'll tell you, Gordy, there were some sights out there that were reallysomething. One of the - one of the things that - most things happenedlike people had said they would. But there were a couple of things thatI had never seen or heard anyone even mention, and maybe they'd been on- been there all along. But one of the things that was really niftywas, while we were in powered flight, both in later stages of the boostand during the TLI burn, there were particles that I could see out thewindow that were going past us in the plus-X direction, and I keptthinking that that was an optical illusion, and I kept going back andlooking at it again, and sure enough! And these were after we were insteady state. It wasn't around any kind of a staging event or anythingthat I was aware of.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 55 37 Fullerton:</b> Oh, how about that. I haven't heard of that one before.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 55 43 Mattingly:</b> Then when we - when wescooted out here and you started your nonpropulsive vent, we could see- First, it just looked like it was a little mist around the outsidewhen you looked at the Sun. And then the Sun hit it at such an anglethat you started getting a spectral reflection, and it looked like arainbow out over the LM. And then after that, you could look out myNumber 1 window, and apparently the lighting was just right so that it- it had the appearance of light streaming off to a point source atinfinity. There was a little blank spot in it at the - at what lookedlike the origin. And then all these streaks were coming back towardsyou, like you were right in the center of a cone. And these thingswould change colors. They go to a light - light purple, and then they'dhave a little sandy color to them. That was another one that I don'tremember ever hearing before, and it was - maybe it was just thelighting on it, but it sure was pretty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 56 46 Fullerton:</b> Roger. Enjoying the description.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 56 53 Mattingly:</b> I'll tell you, you can't wait too many years to make this worth it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 56 59 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 03 Young:</b> Gordy, on that boost, that S-IC is a real freight train. I'll tell you, boy. I can't get over that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 11 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 14 Mattingly:</b> Could you folks see that thing on the TV up through staging?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 20 Fullerton:</b> I didn't watch it all the way until it went out of sight. I'll have to check here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 32 Fullerton:</b> Yeah, I guess we saw even [the LES] tower jett.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 38 Duke:</b> Good show. John's in the middle of his suit doff.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 43 Fullerton:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> We're at four hours, 58 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Most of that long description coming from Ken Mattingly, how...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 57 52 Mattingly:</b> And thanks to good old Stu Roosa's suggestion, we wrote in the Flight Plan to be sure and take a look at the fires out there in Africa as we went over, which is something we probably would have forgotten or never even thought about. And they are just as beautiful as everybody's ever said they could be. They're just all over the place. All these little - little yellowish-red dots down there. And there was some - looked like some low overcast in parts of the area, or maybe it was - from our altitude, maybe it was a high overcast. But it just gave - It looked like looking at the lights of a city through fog, and then there were others that were clear. Just something well worth remembering to look for.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 58 32 Fullerton:</b> Roger. We'll be sure to remind Ron to look for that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 58 43 Mattingly:</b> I tell you, God didn't equip us with enough eyes to see everything that there is to see in the first hour.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 58 51 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control, Houston. 4 hours, 59 minutes. That last remark coming from Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly. Our space digital display still using the Moon as a reference. We show Apollo 16 172,048 nautical miles [318,633 kilometres] away from the Moon.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 59 26 Mattingly:</b> Gordy, it looks like thiswhole operation may take us longer than - than we had guessed. Is thereany thermal constraint on getting a 52 attitude and going to thoseother attitudes? Looks like [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 59 41 Fullerton:</b> I'll cheek on that, Ken. We're about...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 59 42 Mattingly:</b> ...but I just wondered if that's something we ought, to keep in mind.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 59 47 Fullerton:</b> Okays. we're about to a handover here. I'll check on that and come back to you through Hawaii.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>004 59 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>005 00 46 Fullerton:</b> 16, we're - through Hawaiinow. And you're scheduled in this attitude through 7 hours or - atleast, so no problem thermally, and you're not even due to do the P52for another half hour, so you're plenty ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>005 01 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that P52 - We'regoing to come to a decision point; here pretty soon, whether to - youwant us to do that and we'll pick up the suit doffing after that, or we- I'd just as soon go ahead and do the - get all the suits out of theway. And we can do the 52 on schedule, or we can do it after we get thesuits off. Does it make any difference to you folks ?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>005 01 24 Fullerton:</b> Let me check.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>005 01 56 Fullerton:</b> If that's what you'd liketo do, why don't you go ahead with the - finish up the suits. Noproblem slipping the 52 a little bit. And we'd like P00 and Accept forthat up-link.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>005 02 08 Young:</b> Okay, there's P00 and Accept. Is Fredo still around there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>005 02 18 Fullerton:</b> No, he went home about a half hour ago.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>006 03 54 Duke:</b> Hello, Houston; 16. John and I are back up now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 04 00 Fullerton:</b> Roger. That up-link is complete. In case you didn't hear me some time ago, the computer is yours.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 04 l0 Young:</b> Okay, we're in Block.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 04 12 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 04 13 Young:</b> And it took us about an hour for me and Charlie to climb out of those suits and stow them. It's really something.<br></p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 04 23 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"> </p>
      <p class="ed">[Removal and stowage of the A-7LB spacesuits was discussed by John Young, Ken Mattingly and Charlie Duke during the 1972 post-mission debrief:</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Young</b>: Climbing out or that suit is really something.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Mattingly</b>: We had a hard time getting the suits into the suit bag because we were trying to be careful of them. I don't know if taking our pockets off would have helped us or not.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Young</b>: Taking the pockets off is another 10 or 15 minutes per suit. The way they put those things on they're on there to stay. The best way to get them off is to cut them off.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Mattingly</b>: The only point I'm making is that I have stowed suits in the bag in stowage exercises and it's a not a big deal.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Young</b>: It's entirely different in flight and I think there are couple of things that are different. One is the suits which we stowed here [on Earth] never had the pockets and all the paraphenalia straps on. The other thing is you have an old beat up suit that's a rag. You don't care if you step on it, kick it, or what you do to it but when you re on your way to the Moon, you're being ginger with those things.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Mattingly</b>: The bag is just too small for the suits.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Young</b>: Here's something I feel pretty strong about. We haven't had any problems so far but I think that the crews that are going to have to take these suits off and stow them in a bag should be given a demonstration on how to properly roll up and stow an A-7LB pressure suit by a suit technician close to launch so they don't forget what they've learned. Course, that's just another square to fill close to launch. If you damage that suit by stowing it in that bag, and I can see how you could do that because you wouldn't believe the kind of kicking, grunting, shoving and heaving you have to do in zero g to get that suit in there, and if you damage it, there goes your mission because you can't fix it.<br></p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Mattingly: </b>I think that you should point out, we only stowed two suits in a three-suit bag.<br></p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Young:</b> Yes. We only put two suits in there. We got three suits in there on the way back and then found out that we weren't supposed to have three suits in there. We were supposed to stow one of them under the couch. And, we only put two in there on the way out. We stowed Ken's suit undernearth the left couch. But, I was always concerned that maybe we had folded a suit in the wrong direction and put some undue strain on the zipper. We had zipped the zipper up, but we hadn't zipped the pressure sealing zipper up all the way. But we zipped the restraint zipper all the way up and we put the neck ring's dust cover on it.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Mattingly:</b> I think it's a shame to take a chance on the suits on your way to the Moon. I think you should make that bag bigger.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Young:</b> There's about this much room between thebag and the front hatch which is not used and I don't see why theydon't make that big enough so that a guy is not ruining his EVA bystowing his pressure suit. Now, maybe the CSD people will come back andsay you can't hurt those pressure suits. But if I know Ed Smiley, Ireckon he feels that way about it, probably.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Mattingly:</b> Well, the other thing is, when you foldthese on the ground and you got one g helping you pull it up into alittle ball. In flight, it is whatever you could get with your arms.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Young:</b> The other problem is that J-missionspacecraft, with those boxes under you, only one man can get in thereto do the job at any one time,You can't get two men in the space topush the suit right. Well, it was of some concern to me in that we weretreating suits properly when we stowed them that first time.We set anew world record for suit donning and doffing in zero gravity and1/6-gravity seven times, something I would just as soon not have,wewere behind the first day. We didn't have enough time in the timelineto doff the suits and stow them, we didn't have any time in there withone man in the middle of suit doffing, another man is handicappedbecause he's helping. So, that leaves one man to mind the store.</p>
      <p class="ed"><b>Mattingly:</b> We actually had time in the Flight Planfor doffing the suits. We just didn't have adequate time. We had anhour or less and we used almost one hour on the first suit.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 05 19 Fullerton:</b> 16, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 05 23 Young:</b> Go ahead, Gordon.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 05 25 Fullerton:</b> I'm going to hand over toPete here. He's coming on with a good boost there. He's got a bunch of- P37 pad and a bunch of Flight Plan updates for you when you getsomebody free to do some stenographic work there. Enjoyed the first sixhours. Hope the rest of it goes as well.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>006 05 50 Young:</b> Gordon, that was beautiful. Tell Flight and the guys down in the trenches, "Man, that was super!"</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. We've now completed our shift hand over in Mission Control. Flight Director Pete Frank and the Orange Team of Flight Controllers. The CapCom on this shift is astronaut Donald Peterson. We have a change of shift press briefing scheduled to begin momentarily in the MSC News Center briefing room as is our normal practice during change of shift briefings we will have the air to ground line down and we'll be recording any conservations with the crew for playback following the press conference. The coming eight hours or so should be a relatively quiet time for the crew. The booster engineer has pretty well taken care of all activities with the Saturn V third stage of the S-IVB [sic - means S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V]. That vehicle is now gradually separating from the spacecraft [and] tumbling slowly. This is to maintain the proper thermal equilibrium and also to kind of neutralize out any changes in velocity added or subtracted by small ventings from any of the tanks. A normal procedure with the S-IVB.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> The crew is scheduled tobegin a eat period and as we passed up to Charlie Duke we do not expectto have Midcourse Correction 1 based on the current tracking data. At 6hours, 19 minutes, Apollo 16 is traveling at a velocity of 11,159 feet[3,401 metres] per second now, 29,187 nautical miles [54,054kilometres] from Earth. This is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>
