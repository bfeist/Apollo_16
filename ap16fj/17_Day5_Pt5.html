      <p class="obcm"><b>101 12 48 Young (LM comm):</b> Ken, I don't know. If- if you want to get closer right now, I don't care. I think that - Iwould like for you to be in good station-keep position and be sure whatyou're doing, and then we'll just go on around. Okay? Kind of dark outthere. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 13 08 Duke (LM comm):</b> We can still see your probe.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 16 29 Duke (LM comm):</b> Boy, that landing site and that North and South Ray are really something, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 16 34 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> That sure is. I got a good look at them a couple of times.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 16 37 Duke (LM comm):</b> It looks just like the LMA.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 16 41 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Sure looks different than it did yesterday.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 16 43 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 16 54 Young (LM comm):</b> Guess we better [garble] track [garble]. On the ground [garble].</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 17 36 Young (LM comm):</b> Phew! There's no cooling on this thing at all.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 18 19 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Sure looks like a jack-o'-lantern.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 18 29 Young (LM comm):</b> Oh, me! Give me some water, Charlie. I'm really about to erp.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 18 33 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay, just a minute.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 23 59 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 24 02 Duke (LM comm):</b> It's off. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 24 04 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Loud and clear. I got a - a squeal with you. But I got you good and - good and clear.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 24 13 Duke (LM comm):</b> Ken, how do you read now?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 24 15 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> You still got a real bad squeal.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 24 21 Duke (LM comm):</b> Ken, over.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 24 51 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Loud and clear.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 25 10 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay, Ken. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 25 12 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Loud and clear. How me?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 25 13 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay, if you read, I'm transmitting -</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 25 17 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; are you getting - getting me now?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 25 35 Duke (LM comm):</b> How do you read, Ken?</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 25 41 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm transmitting on B and receiving on A.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 25 49 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay. Why don't we try- I think it's our B Receiver. Why don't you try B Duplex? Transmit B -correction, transmit A and receive B.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 00 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well - Okay, just a second. Let's go to something simplex. That worked real nice.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 09 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay, B Simplex.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 10 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay. B Simplex.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 32 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay. I think it's our B Receiver.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 35 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, why don't we use A Simplex then?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 39 Duke (LM comm):</b> Tag back here in 30 seconds.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 43 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Say again?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 45 Duke (LM comm):</b> A Simplex is no good. Tag back B Simplex in 30 seconds.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 26 49 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 27 01 Duke (LM comm):</b> VHF A, Ken?</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 27 08 Duke (LM comm):</b> That's the best one. It - it's our B Receiver is a little scratchy.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 28 35 Young (LM comm):</b> Ken, this in plane may be mighty bad if the Sun comes up and hits you in the eyes. I don't know which way you're pointed.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 28 46 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I don't either.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 28 50 Young (LM comm):</b> Find out right quick.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 28 53 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah. Well, if it is [garble] field of view.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 29 01 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, I'm pointing...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 29 02 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> It ought to - Ithink you're the one that's going to be looking into the Sun, becausewe're in - in an inertial attitude and I was looking at the Sun atsunset. I think the Sun's going to rise over my back. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 29 22 Young (LM comm):</b> That'll be fine. I don't care.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 29 32 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm glad to hear that because there's really not much that I can do about it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 29 39 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, I knew that there wasn't. You know, if we do PDI from now, it will be a miracle.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 29 47 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm afraid you're right. And here comes the Sun. Man, are you bright.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 30 00 Duke (LM comm):</b> Well, Ken, at least our urine dump works.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 30 04 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> (Laughter) Well, I guess [garble] you have to have something to do. Have to get down and get that water in a few minutes. I thought about that on the last pass, and I thought I had - had more than enough time to get it squared away.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 30 27 Duke (LM comm):</b> Well, we don't see you venting anything. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 30 29 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm not. Had a problem [garble]. Afraid I'm gonna - gonna pop that relief valve if they don't [garble].</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 30 42 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay; well, are you - No. Hey, Ken, if you - you're in great shape. Why don't you go get it, and we'll - watch it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 30 55 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Let's wait until we get - get daylight on the whole spacecraft.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 31 00 Duke (LM comm):</b> Oh, we ain't got day - I got daylight on you.</p><a name="101_31_02"></a>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 31 02 Mattingly (CM comm):</b>You have? Okay. That's a beautiful sight. All right, I'm going to godown and turn the dump on, and if it looks like it's going to obscureour vision, then I'll - holler and I'll turn it off right away.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 31 16 Duke (LM comm):</b> We'll do it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 08 Duke (LM comm):</b> Bring that out of there! I can see why that's propulsive.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 23 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; I'm back at the capsule to visual.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 29 Young (LM comm):</b> Okeydokey.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 31 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Man, we must be over the Sea of Rain.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 38 Duke (LM comm):</b> Ken, you ought to see that dust squirt out of there.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 41 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I can see it going past you.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 45 Duke (LM comm):</b> I got a good picture of that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 47 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> That's good. Somebody will get something out of all this.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 56 Young (LM comm):</b> Looks like you're translating your spacecraft.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 32 58 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I've picked up quite a drift here.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 33 40 Mattingly (CM onboard?):</b> Man, that's a long wench coming over the cold north [garble].</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 37 56 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> You guys have another dump going?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 37 58 Duke (LM comm):</b> No. This thing just catches this in a can down there, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 03 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Oh. There was still something. Maybe it's just - my stuff was bouncing off of you.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 08 Young (LM comm):</b> Hey, there's an icicle hanging off that dump.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 11 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> That right?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 13 Young (LM comm):</b> Is you about to go ahead and terminate?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 16 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I beg your pardon?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 18 Young (LM comm):</b> (Vox) popped your dump valve, there.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 21 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Did you say something about terminating?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 25 Young (LM comm):</b> (Vox)nate your dump?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 28 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> If you want me to. Like I'm down to 50 percent.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 35 Young (LM comm):</b> It's ice, I guess.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 52 Young (LM comm):</b> That little door down there that's open, is that the solar door?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 38 57 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, the solardoor should be down off my left foot. Yeah, underneath the terminallines of the urine dump - the water dump, rather. Can you see it fromthere?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 12 Young (LM comm):</b> Sure can.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 14 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> How about that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 31 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> If you'd like to yaw around and get the Sun out of your eyes - you can do that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 38 Duke (LM comm):</b> We're in great shape. It's not in our eyes, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 40 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Oh, okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 42 Duke (LM comm):</b> Ken, your SIM bay is all retracted.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 46 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; how abouttaking a look at that mass spec. You - you know where that one is.That's the one in the - all the way in the aft shell, and it's the onetowards the plus-Y axis.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 39 58 Young (LM comm):</b> Cover's silver, right?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 40 01 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Beg your pardon? The cover over it is white. The silver cover goes over the gamma ray.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 40 09 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay; it's all - everything's in, and all the covers are closed.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 40 16 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay. That's interesting.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 40 19 Duke (LM comm):</b> Following us?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 40 22 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, he's drifting some.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 40 30 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I wastrying to see what this dump did. Looks like it started out giving meDelta-V and then it looked like it quit. Or at least it changed. Itcould be that it - if it's forming icicles out there, that it'sdeflecting us up.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 41 17 Duke (LM comm):</b> That big chicken's been over on this side again, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 41 22 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah. That sure is a fascinating place down there. [Garble] good-size chicken, though.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 41 42 Duke (LM comm):</b> You said it was - onceyou tried it with the - in Accel Command with the 204. Did that have -It said it looked like it was stable but oscillating. What does thatmean?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 41 57 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, it meantthat it was pointing about plus or minus one degree. But it seemed tobe pointing at one degree about the desired axis.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 42 10 Duke (LM comm):</b> We got you about ten minutes on the dump, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 42 14 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; I'm down to 40 percent. I got my timer running here.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 42 23 Duke (LM comm):</b> One for you, too. You know every crater - every one over here shows those lineations, like on 15.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 42 32 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I wasnoticing that. Everywhere I looked, I saw that. In the craters, in thehighlands, in the - just the whole surface of the Moon is covered thatway. I was about to decide it was an optical illusion, but the lasttime I came across Theophilus down low, it turned out that thoselineations follow the depressions that touch the craters that are alongthe rim. Where - where there was a crater on the rim, you see these -these little lineations curve around it. They take the same pattern,like there is really a whole bunch of - of fractures there. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 43 14 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 43 19 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> But you're right.They're everywhere. I haven't seen any place, except there's a coupleof places around Descartes that looked to me like they didn't have it.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; 101 hours, 44 minutes into the mission of Apollo 16. Fourteen minutes before the start of revolution number 14 around the Moon. At which time shortly after the spacecraft, which now should be nose-to-nose station keeping, will come around the east limb of the Moon. They will be given a Go/No-Go decision from the ground on whether or not to make the landing during the succeeding rev- revolution, or lunar orbit number 16. To recap again, the source of the current situation and delaying the landing, [is] the secondary, back up system, which actually acts as a tiller for the large 20,000 pound [89,000 newton] thrust engine in the Service Propulsion System, or the main engine on the Command Service Module, has experienced some difficulties in the yaw mode or the left and right motion of the engine. The engine is moved up and down, left and right by what are called gimbal actuators. This back up system in the Command Module guidance equipment is used if there is a failure in the primary system, which is called the Guidance and Navigation, or the G&amp;N system. And the flight mission rules call for both systems to be functioning perfectly before a landing is committed. Simulations at the manufacturer's plant in California and in the Command Module simulators here in Houston have been under way for the last several hours to determine the possible effects of having this oscillation - left to right oscillation - by the engine, whether or not it would damage the spacecraft structurally. Some initial times have been generated here by the Flight Dynamics people on the maneuvers for a landing should the decision be made to continue with the landing. The Command Module circularization burn would be made at 103:22:05. The Powered Descent Ignition [sic] or the start of the landing phase would be at 104:17:20 Ground Elapsed Time. These times are subject to change within a few seconds one way or another. To repeat again, some 11 minutes from now the two spacecraft will come around the front-side to start lunar orbit number 15. The spacecraft communicator will pass up to the crew the Go/No-Go decision for landing during revolution number 16. The crew has requested that if a landing is made that the EVA be postponed until after they can have a sleep period.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 43 47 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> All right. Let'ssee, if we delay - I bet one of the constraints may even be the Sunangle for me. Just trying to think - looking back at - at how mucheffect that Sun angle had between looking at that landmark last nightand looking at it this morning. Last night you couldn't tell North andSouth Ray. You could tell that the craters were there, but you couldn'tsee any rays. And this morning, the rays were very obvious. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 44 15 Duke (LM comm):</b> I think the constraint to landing is you.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 44 18 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, I'mthinking that, if we get a - if we get a workaround, which right now,I'm fresh out of ideas. But they've given me clever ideas before.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 44 30 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah. Let me say I didn't mean that "you" literally.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 44 41 Young (LM comm):</b> It'd be better. You'dget shadows and - and then the shadow of the LM when it comes down, incase this landing radar does its thing again.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 51 23 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Looks like allthose little particles there, they're coming out and slowing it down.They look like they're just sort of stopping out there. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 51 31 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay; it's almost stopped, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 51 34 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> The thing I haven't figured out is that the particles also look like they're coming out slower.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>101 52 52 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; rough calculation says we should pick up AOS about 102:02 [garble].</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 55 16 Young (LM comm):</b> What's your best guess for P21, say, Ken?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 55 20 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Where we are right now. We're about 125 degrees, probably about 30 miles high.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 55 29 Young (LM comm):</b> I don't care. Just wondering when we was going to get acquisition.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 55 33 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'd say about 102:02, I think.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 55 37 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 55 38 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> That's about 100degrees east and gonna be about 25 miles high. I got that out of ourspiffy - spiffy little P29. He's doing longitude now. Get that. Thatwasn't a bad guess. We're now at a 121 and 33 miles high.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 56 19 Duke (LM comm):</b> Ken, the way that figure looks, we're down to one gimbal motor in yaw then, huh?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 56 25 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, that's right unless they can find something. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 56 30 Young (LM comm):</b> Well, there's not much that they can find on the ground to fix it, though.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 56 34 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, they mayfind some crude control mode that you could use in here that would makeit oscillatory but not unstable. It's the divergence [garble] it'stracking. If it had been just the [garble] we got to go ahead and burn;then we go [garble] the Moon. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 57 02 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I tell you, that thing is really threatening to whip around to[at?] the back end. Think it'd just be [garble] like that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 57 22 Young (LM comm):</b> They've got the data from one that you'd let it do that on a little?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 57 27 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I showed itto them on two separate occasions on that last pass. Both times, theyhad high gain all the way. So there should be no question about it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 57 55 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I just really didn't follow their comment about what they were trying to duplicate conditions on the simulator.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 58 13 Young (LM comm):</b> Well, they want to make - make it unstable and see if somebody can fly it. Would you believe?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 58 24 Duke (LM comm):</b> Hey, Ken. If they letus go, boy, I'll tell you, if you ask me, you ought to just forgetabout that MEP - EMP thing, and just leave the gimbal motors on thosesix minutes.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>101 58 51 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, I reallydon't really know if that had anything to do with it or not. It - itwould seem that, with this being our first gimbal problem and that'sthe first time we've done that, that would seem like a reasonable thingto suspect. But if that's what they suspect, then - then the nextanswer is pull the plug.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>102 01 36 Irwin:</b> Okay, Orion can always tellCasper what his problem is, but it looks like an open circuit in therate feedback and your servo loop. We've run exhaustive tests down hereon the West Coast and East Coast on controlability aspects andstructural aspects, and everything looks satisfactory. On Apollo 9, weran - a similar test was run, as you probably remember. And if such a -such a problem did occur up there, you could expect oscillations, ofcourse, with the gimbal, but you could expect a steady attitude. Itwould be a limit cycle. So we're convinced down here that we have asatisfactory control mode if we have to revert to that one. Over.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>102 44 02 Irwin:</b> Roger; could you give us the - your Noun 93s? We'd - had lost data at that point.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 44 10 Duke (LM):</b> Yeah, sorry about that,Jim. Here they are: the star angle difference was 4 balls 1, minus 4balls 1; our torque angles were minus 0.067, plus 0.108, plus 0.050;torqued at 104:42:25.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>102 45 30 Young (LM):</b> Hey Houston, I don't know where Ken is at this point when we missed up into our P52. I trust he is still keeping an eye on us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 45 40 Irwin:</b> I hope so too.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 45 41 Young (LM):</b> Hey, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 46 20 Irwin:</b> And, Orion; this is Houston. Just a reminder on the 400 plus 3, and a Verb 47.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 46 31 Duke (LM):</b> Roger; we already did that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 46 33 Irwin:</b> Okay; very good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 47 14 Irwin:</b> Charlie, this is Houston. Could you put your mike a little closer? Your volume seems to be a little lower than - than John's.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 47 26 Duke (LM):</b> Okay; how's that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 47 28 Irwin:</b> That's better.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 47 32 Duke (LM):</b> Okay; I had one of them up. Every time I turn my head I get orange juice.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 47 39 Irwin:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 47 50 Duke (LM):</b> It's delicious, Jim, but it's better in your mouth than floating around the cockpit.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 47 55 Irwin:</b> I know what you mean. I wish I had some. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 48 00 Duke (LM):</b> As a matter of fact, I've already had an orange shampoo with the helmet on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 48 09 Irwin:</b> I guess that's better than no shampoo.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 48 15 Duke (LM):</b> Yeah, I think you're right.Jim, we were really impressed with that landing site from ten miles,anyway, it sure looks exactly like the LMA.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 48 32 Irwin:</b> Okay, Charlie. We're kind of curious about the orange juice problem. Did you have a - a bag failure?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 48 39 Duke (LM):</b> Well, I think it must bethe valve. The Command Module water had a lot of air bubbles in it andwhen I - of course, when I put my suit on, it sort of compressedeverything. And every time my mike comes by and grabs the - the valve,it bends it down just slightly, which is - which is enough to causesome to squirt out due to the pressure from the suit. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 49 04 Irwin:</b> We copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 49 10 Young (LM):</b> I have the same problem all the time in one g.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 49 15 Duke (LM):</b> Yeah, at one g though, you bend over and it's on your visor and you can lick it off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 49 59 Duke (LM):</b> Casper, Orion transmitting VHF A Simplex. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 09 Irwin:</b> Charlie, this is Houston. We're kind of concerned about how much...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 Duke (LM):</b> Casper, Orion...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 13 Irwin:</b> ...orange juice might havespilled out. We're concerned about the amount that might have got inthe suit loop and its effect on the LiOH canister.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 25 Duke (LM):</b> Jim, most of it, for somereason floated up under my helmet - I mean my Snoopy hat, and I'mpretty sticky around the temples and all; and I don't think anything -most of it stuck right in my helmet. And the suit loop flow is notenough to drive it down under - into the suit. And I don't feel likeI'm wet at all down in that area. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 49 Irwin:</b> Okay; thank you, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 51 03 Young (LM):</b> Yeah, I don't - I don'tthink there is any of it in the suit loop to amount to anything.Looking at Charlie, I can tell where most of it is. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 51 27 Duke (LM):</b> Yes, Ken, I was just seeinghow you read. We're all set to go for your circ. Okay, what kind of sepmaneuver did you do? All right, thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 51 55 Irwin:</b> Orion, let's try Biomed, Left.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 52 02 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, you got John's arrhythmia.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 52 05 Irwin:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 52 53 Duke (LM):</b> Houston, Orion. I'd like toconfirm that in System A we have enough ullage volume to get all thepropellants out of the tank. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 53 02 Irwin:</b> That's not correct, Charlie, we'll give you the exact number here shortly.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 53 12 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, we're still looking at 2000 - about 2100 psi [14500 kPa] on the helium.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 54 37 Irwin:</b> Orion, this - this is Houston.In answer to your question, Charlie. If you were to lose sourcepressure right now, you could get 35 percent out. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 54 50 Duke (LM):</b> Okay; well, we only have 50 - 50 percent remaining.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 54 55 Irwin:</b> Understand. And that 35 percent is enough to complete this mission.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 55 02 Duke (LM):</b> Okay. if we could - Do we have a double failure here on the two regs and that loop?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 55 07 Irwin:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 55 14 Duke (LM):</b> Okay. So what's holding us is that check valve that unseats at 2 - about 225 and reseats at 212?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 55 25 Irwin:</b> That's correct, Charlie. And really you have - should have about 60 percent in that system. Your gage has an error in it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 55 35 Duke (LM):</b> We copy. Roger; we copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 01 26 Duke (LM):</b> Houston, Orion.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 01 27 Irwin:</b> Go ahead, Orion.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 01 31 Duke (LM):</b> Roger, Jim. We watchedKen's waste water dump, and I can see why that thing really gives FDOfits. It really comes out of there like a water hose.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 01 44 Irwin:</b> Okay; we copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 01 45 Duke (LM):</b> And we took a picture of it, or two, and I hope they come out and show you that. We had pretty good lighting.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 01 54 Irwin:</b> Good; we hope you have some good pictures of it. And we're showing about two minutes and a half to LOS.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>102 04 16 Roosa:</b> Hey, Ken, I've got a couple other words about that if you'd like to listen.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 04 26 Mattingly:</b> I surely would, Stu.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 04 27 Roosa:</b> Okay. Most of the cases wherethey appeared to be diverging to you and you shut it off the motor,would short, and some of them was just very close to the point at whichit became stable. And on some of the - the longer ones, we did see thestability, but those that you called as diverging were short ofreaching this stable point, it appears that the controllability is notgoing to be any problem when - If you would have to burn with this,according to the stroking tests on [Apollo] 9, you'll get a lot of - ofoscillations and you'll feel the spacecraft shaking, but the attitudewill not be changing. You'll probably see the rate needles movingaround a little bit. And just for your info also, most probably do theburns with the 90 degree roll, so we'll have a - so we'll have theredundancy in the - in the yaw axis platform consideration.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 05 43 Mattingly:</b> That sounds like a good plan. Now, I guess if I'd have been a little smarter, we'd have pressed on on schedule.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 05 49 Roosa:</b> No, I don't think so, Ken. They- they appeared to be diverging and it was a - it was a true divergenceas far as you could tell. It - it was just, in most cases, just shortof becoming stable.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 06 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I tell you - you knowthe difference in this and the simulator, where you can really feel itmove, and this old dog was really wagging its tail.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 06 14 Roosa:</b> Yes. You know, Jim was talkingabout the Apollo 9 test, and he said that - that they really - youreally feel it in the spacecraft. But this thing is stable. They have -they've really checked that out, and it'll rattle and roll a littlebit, if you have to use it, but it's stable. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 06 37 Mattingly:</b> Sounds good. Once again, the ground earns their pay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 06 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, I guess I'm inneed of a general outline of where we intercept the Flight Plan. And itlooks like one of the things I'll be needing is a - some kind of aseparation burn from Orion again, so that I'm not setting here blastingit into his face. And then I'll need a certain burn pad. And afterthat, I'll - I guess we just sort of stumble along and try to pick upsome landmark tracking and things like that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 07 27 Roosa:</b> Okay...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 07 28 Mattingly:</b> My fuel is kind of low.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 07 33 Roosa:</b> Okay, of course, as you know,we're working the Flight Plan now, and Hank's got the - the pads foryou. And I just wanted to make one other comment now. Do you have anyother questions - do you have any reservations about this duty, becausewe sure want to get - get your concurrence? But everything looks likeit's - it's go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 07 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Did somebody fly one of these in the CMS?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 08 02 Roosa:</b> Well, But...it's been flown on the hardware evaluator.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>102 48 47 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by, Ken. I'll get you an answer on that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 49 18 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken, what we'd likefor you to do is leave the secondary gimbal motors off until you havefinished the gimbal drive check, then bring the secondary gimbal motorson, and do a normal burn.

      <p class="tech"><b>102 29 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll not do - I'll dothe gimbal drive check with the secondary in pitch - unless - Are theyin the same package? It seems like they're in separate packages. Thesecondary in yaw is the one I'll bring on after the gimbal drive check.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 49 59 Hartsfield:</b> That's okay, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 01 Mattingly:</b> Or would you rather just not exercise it. It's macht's nicht to me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 09 Hartsfield:</b> It's your druthers, Ken. If you want to do it that way, that's fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>102 50 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It'll just verifythat I've got everything else hooked up properly. I'd like to keep asclose to the normal procedures as I can. Hey, you did copy the P52things?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>102 58 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and I took the trimmaneuver in P40 and I put that bias to Attitude B, 90 degrees roll, 139pitch, and 1.7 in yaw, and that's about right, considering the roll.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Andwe've had loss of signal as Apollo 16 spacecraft Orion and Casper havepassed behind the Moon. Nearing the end of lunar orbit 15, some 47minutes before spacecraft come around for the 16th revolution andsubsequent landing which is now scheduled for Ground Elapsed Time of -actually the ignition for PDI, Powered Descent Initiation will be at104:17:23 with the landing some 12 minutes later. The powered descentwill have a total velocity change of 6,703 feet [2,043 metres] persecond. The crew has been advised - that is the crew of Orion - thatthey will be about 16,000 feet [5,000 metres] high above the normalflight path at the time of powered descent, and some 20 000 feet [6,000metres] south of track. However, the Lunar Module guidance system willguide the spacecraft to take these discrepancies [out and make a ]normal landing. After landing the crew will then have a sleep periodprior to beginning the first EVA which at this time is scheduled tobegin at 118 hours 30 minutes Ground Elapsed Time or about 10:30 a.m.tomorrow morning Central Time. The decision on whether or not the EVAswill be their full length - a total of 21 hours - will be made duringthe night while the crew is asleep. Such factors as the consumablesremaining such as battery power et cetera in the Lunar Module will havean effect on this decision. To go back and recapitulate, the reasonsfor the delay in landing was [that] Ken Mattingly, on hiscircularization burn during revolution number 13, experienced aoscillation in the yaw mode for the Service Module engine duringcheckout and it turns out that the secondary servo loop or one of thecircuits for the yaw gimbal drive which can be controlled by either theG&amp;N system or the Stabilization and Control System (which is abackup mode) apparently had this oscillation in it. Subsequentsimulations and tests here and across the country have found that thereis no potential structural hazard to the spacecraft even if it werenecessary to go to the mode where there might be some chatteroscillation in the yaw gimbal. [The] Gimbal is the yoke on which theengine is mounted; one for pitch and one for yaw and the thrust vectorcontrol system in effect acts as a tiller for turning the engine muchas you would use a handle on an outboard motor to direct the thrust ofthe propeller. The thrust vector control aligns the engine through thecenter of gravity of the spacecraft. At 103:09 into the mission ofApollo 16, this is Apollo Control.</p><a name="103_14"></a>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, 103 hours, 49 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Less than two minutes before Apollo 16 spacecraft Orion and Casper, come around on the 16th revolution. Some 27 minutes away from ignition for the power descent and subsequent landing which should take place around 8:23 p.m. Central Standard Time. Ignition for the descent to the lunar surface is now programmed for a Ground Elapsed Time of 104:17:23 seconds. As Casper comes around the corner it should have circularized its orbit around the Moon with the burn maneuver for circularization having taken place at 103:22 Ground Elapsed Time, some half hour ago while the spacecraft was behind the Moon. The Lunar Module Orion weighing some 18 tons now will weigh half that amount at touch down, some 9 tons. All of this weight loss is propellant that will be consumed by the descent engine. Here in the Control Center all of the scribing plotters in the center display panel in the front of the room have been changed around from lunar orbit tracking chart to show the - we have CSM AOS as confirmed by the network controller. We'll come up live now with the air-to-ground circuit to monitor the next hour and half [of] front-side pass on Rev 16 and hopefully a successful landing.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>103 59 10 Hartsfield:</b> That was a good readback, Ken. And Stu would like to give you some words on the rendezvous.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 59 16 Roosa:</b> Okay, Ken. I got a couple ofcomments about - in the event of a PDI abort as far as the rendezvousscheme. And you might want a sheet of paper there to jot down a coupleof things.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 59 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay; I got a little corner here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>103 59 31 Roosa:</b> Okay, we're going to do thenavigation in SCS. In other words, the marking routine; and we'll usethe CMC to maneuver us into the burn attitude and set us up for thetracking. We'll burn in SCS, and there are three places through herethat you can activate that relay, if you're using the normalprocedures. Now we've got some detailed procedures we won't read to younow. If we get in that situation, we'll talk to you a bit. But thethree times that you want to watch out for are: don't place theSpacecraft Control in CMC with the Optics Mode in Manual. I thinkyou're probably pretty familiar with that one. Don't respond to the 204display with Spacecraft Control in CMC. And if you make a burn, you'llprobably be trimming it with G&amp;N. And wait until you've got yourVerb 16, your Noun 85 display up before going back to CMC. And we cantalk about it in detail, like I say, later if we need it. We've run acouple of these and they go pretty smooth.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 00 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Stu. The way Iunderstand the scheme is that for attitude holding, while we're doingnavigation, we'll do it in SCS; and when we're ready to go to work,why, we'll do CMC maneuver to the burn attitude, and we'll make theburn in SCS to avoid this relay again. Then, we don't ever want to goto CMC control with the Optics in Manual, and we don't want to respondto 204 with the CMC command. And the third one, I didn't copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 01 32 Roosa:</b> Okay. If you do a burn in yourSCS, you - depending on what you've done there, Ken, you'd probably endup with your flashing 99 display. And we want to make sure that you goon to your Noun 85 display, before you go to CMC. Then go ahead andtrim the G&amp;N residuals.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 01 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Houston. Roger, I understand. We don't want to go through that transient at the end of the P40, certainly.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 02 06 Roosa:</b> Righto. And that one thing, too...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 02 08 Mattingly:</b> If they do not respond to 204, Stu - if they don't respond to that, do you mean don't even Enter on it? Go by past it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 02 16 Roosa:</b> That's exactly what I mean.Don't Enter on it. Of course, you'll be doing the SCS burn, but don'tEnter on that, or you will activate that relay - until you put thespacecraft to SCS control.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 02 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay; as long as it's in SCS control, though, - I can by pass no problem. the 204 with</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 02 37 Roosa:</b> That's affirmative, Ken. Ifyou're in SCS control, that relay - the power is interrupted, that -the power to that relay goes through the Spacecraft Control switch, andit's got to be in CMC.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 02 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 02 52 Roosa:</b> And one other point now I'd like to clarify, Ken, is that for your tracking - see after you go to your track attitude, CMC will start you off on a rate drive, and then go to SCS Control and go to Minimum Impulse and Pitch, and just every now and then, you might have to flip it - like between PPI [?] and Midcourse 1, it just took one Minimum Impulse time and kept me right up around the 22 degrees trunnion.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 03 24 Mattingly:</b> Roger. Sounds like you've been working, too.</p>

And they just pointed out they made anerror here at 105:29 in your Flight Plan. The Image Motion should comeOn after T-start with the mapping camera. That was a procedural error.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 48 59 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I understand that; no sweat.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 49 07 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, let me read backwhat I have. 105:20, you want the mapper door open; at 23, you want toextend it. At 28, the Laser Altimeter comes On; 29 we get Pan Camera toStandby, Stereo, and Power; to Operate at P-start, which is 05:29:27.The Mapping Camera comes On at 105:29:27. The IMC comes On, and we putit to barber pole, on the Image Motion. At 50, we'll get AOS, and we'dlike to have SIM bay activation. It's my understanding you'd like forme to hold SIM bay activation until we're within AOS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 49 51 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 49 52 Mattingly:</b> Mass Spec Boom deployed toeight feet, which is T plus 01. I got your answer, thank you. Gamma Raydeployed to seven and a half feet. That's 53 seconds. The Mass SpecExperiment On, and the Ion Source is Standby. The Alpha X-Ray doorcomes open; the X-Ray goes On. At 59:27, the Pan Camera Mode goes toStandby, and the Power comes Off when you give me a call.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 16 Hartsfield:</b> That's a good readback, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I think we've got it made. We may get caught up yet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 34 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. And I guess when we start bringing that on, Ken...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 36 Mattingly:</b> [Garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 37 Hartsfield:</b> ...and we ought to bring the S-Band Aux TV to 5, so we can get the data.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Any harm in my doing that now so we don't forget it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 49 Hartsfield:</b> Go right ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 50 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You've got it. Andwhen we get AOS next time, I'm content to - while we're reading thingsup, I'll be prepared to copy some things. And I'll be prepared to hoparound and reconfigure whatever you need in real time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 51 11 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. That's real good, Ken. Go ahead and get your suit off and get comfortable.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 51 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll - I'm just aboutto the point where I'll take my comm carrier off so I'll be off commhere for about ten minutes. What's LOS time?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 51 30 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we have LOS in about 12 minutes, somewhere around 03.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 51 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I may not be back up for that, but, if not, I'll just execute this Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 51 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; Ken, and good work.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 51 48 Mattingly:</b> You guys did all the worktoday. I tell you, if we ever get a chance to look out that window,it's gonna stand you on your ears. That earthshine is as spectacular asany of the other things, which is much to my surprise.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 52 00 Hartsfield:</b> I hope, with our position now, we can get on to doing some looking.</p>to copy. <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b>This is Apollo Control and Orion is safely on the ground at Descartes,having landed at 104:29:36 Ground Elapsed Time. In local time that's8:23 p.m. [The] time of landing [was] not to far away from the plannedlanding point. After the crew has a chance to power down the LunarModule, do some housekeeping they will have a sleep period which willbegin at about 107 hours, about two hours and ten minutes from now.With EVA 1 starting tomorrow morning out about 10:30 a.m. CentralStandard Time. This is Apollo Control at 104:51.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 52 13 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, well - I cheated alittle bit there, and we didn't really have an awful lot to do while wewere just spinning around. And some of those low revs came up with somevery interesting observations. In particular, the one that strikes memost vividly is the fact that - if you remember all of those apparentlineations we saw in Silver Spur in the places around Hadley in thepictures. Those same kind of things appear all over the surface of theMoon down now. It's just everywhere I look in the area where there'sany topographical relief. They go in all different directions. Ihaven't been able to sort out if there's some preferred direction orsome reason for it. What - what I did happen to notice as I came acrossTheophilus on one of those passes was that you see this in the walls ofTheophilus - that's on the interior - and in the places where there arecraters around the outside or some kind of - looks like some fractureor something of that nature that goes across Theophilus or into it. Yousee what looks like a reflection in that these patterns - if you had acrater on the rim - these patterns would sorta show up like you wouldexpect from a shock pattern. They would be radial and concentric tothat crater. And these little lines seem to take that kind of a twistand then the fact that some of them go along with topographic highs.I'll see if I can get some photos. I didn't take any photos on thisstuff because I didn't have a chance, but I looked out and saw some ofthese things, and they're just everywhere.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 53 50 Hartsfield:</b> That sounds like a real interesting observation there, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 53 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm going to get my suit off, and if I don't catch you at LOS, I'll see you at AOS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>104 54 02 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p><a name="104_54_18"></a>
