      <p class="tech"><b>235 37 16 England:</b> Good morning, Apollo 16; Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 37 38 Young:</b> Morning, Tony.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 37 40 England:</b> Good morning up there. Say, I think we may have driven your High Gain into the stops. Could you check on 225 the High Gain Flight Bus and Group 2? If one's out, push it in.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control in the early wakeup some 5 minutes early because of the High Gain Antenna. Apparently some minor difficulty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 38 32 Young:</b> They're in, Tony, and can't move it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 38 41 England:</b> Which ones were out?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 38 46 Young:</b> They're in!</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 39 38 England:</b> Okay, John, on that High Gain, could we put it to Pitch at minus 40, to Yaw at 90, Reacq, and Narrow?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 40 04 Young:</b> Okay, that's where we are right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 40 08 England:</b> Okay, and we understand that no circuit breaker was popped.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 40 15 Young:</b> That's correct. There was no circuit breaker popped.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 40 21 England:</b> Okay, thank you.</p> <a name="235_40_34"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 40 34 England:</b> And, after you finish your post-sleep up there, before you stop PTC, we'd like to update your checklist or Flight Plan. We've got a couple of changes on the - the PTC initiation, there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 40 56 Young:</b> Changes on initiation before we stop, huh? Okay. Okay, don't blow our record, now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 41 05 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 41 17 Young:</b> You're talking about the super gal, huh? I'm ready to copy, Tony.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 41 23 England:</b> Okay. Okay, for the PTC initiations at 260 plus 44 and 264:01, we'd like to change the PTC procedures and the G&C checklist to keep the PTC coning within plus or minus 3 degrees in pitch and yaw. Okay, if we could go to the G&C 8-2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 41 57 Young:</b> Okay, why don't you just tell me first what the general scheme is, how you're going to do that, while we're getting the book out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 42 03 England:</b> Okay, fine. We'll use you B/D roll, but we'll keep the pitch and yaw jets - D3, D4, C3, and C4 jets - on. And we're gonna leave the roll jets on, too.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 42 32 Young:</b> In other words, you want this thing to - to remain in attitude control throughout the PTC?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 42 38 England:</b> That's right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 42 44 Mattingly:</b> Oh, delete the P from PTC. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 42 49 England:</b> You're right (laughter). I guess we'd call it ATC now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 43 01 Mattingly:</b> There you go. How about AGS? You got to figure out what that stands for, but it's better.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 43 17 Mattingly:</b> You're a scientist; that shouldn't be hard, Tony.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 43 29 England:</b> Active galaxy st - scan?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 43 31 Mattingly:</b> Do you want us to, try - that's very close. You get a 95.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 43 38 England:</b> (Laughter) I want to quit your course.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 43 45 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Oh, It's right down there, John. How you doing on the High Gain? I don't know if you shifted to it or not; looks like we're where you could pick up, now. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 43 59 England:</b> We're gonna try it down here. If we lose comm, why, we'd like you to go ahead and try to acquire it yourself.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 44 07 Mattingly:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 44 21 England:</b> And let me know when you're ready with the G&C.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 44 31 Mattingly:</b> I'm ready. No. No.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 45 12 England:</b> Ken, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 45 16 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 45 21 England:</b> Did you acquire or did we do that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 45 26 Mattingly:</b> You did that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 45 27 England:</b> Oh, good show. Okay, in the G&C Checklist, perform Steps 1 through 4. After the rates are damped in step 5 under the "Auto RCS select," use B/D roll and D3, D4, C3, C4 jets. And you might just sort of write this in at the side - not cross anything out because later on you'll go back to the normal procedure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 46 03 Mattingly:</b> Roger; I understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 46 04 England:</b> Okay, in Step 6, use a minus 0.30 degrees a second, and 3.0 degrees in Noun 79.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 46 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 46 21 England:</b> And delete the last two steps.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 46 23 Mattingly:</b> As long as we're remaining active, why - as long as we're remaining active, why are we trying to damp the rates, Tony?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 46 49 England:</b> Okay, I guess they're not going to let you - they're not going to ask you to damp it down too long. They're just going to get it down to a reasonable rate and then start it up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 47 00 England:</b> Okay, and delete Step 7.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 47 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Roger. I understand.</p>
      <p class="ed">[The PAO, Mission Control and Crew are using the updated GET, intended to align events to the Flight Plan. At this stage in the flight, the difference from the actual GET is 24 hours, 45 minutes and 52 seconds. See <a href="transcription.html#timings">here</a> for more details.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 47 10 England:</b> Okay, and a note here for the PTC attitude at 275 plus 50 [251:03], use the normal PTC procedures. Okay, now we can go to the updating on the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 47 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay, what you're really saying is that except for this - these two special things, we're just gonna do what we always do, right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 47 36 England:</b> That's affirmative. I just say it the long way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 47 42 Young:</b> All righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 47 44 England:</b> Okay, from 262 plus 00 [237:13] to 262:20 [237:33], we're gonna schedule in some geology debriefing for EVA-3 for John and Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 48 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay; Tony, I got that - it's written down. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 48 40 England:</b> Okay, fine. At 264:30 [239:43], change "Purge O<sub>2</sub> Fuel Cell 1" to "O<sub>2</sub> Fuel Cell purge." And then right under that, cancel out all that Mass Spec exercise between 264:35 [239:48] and 264:45 [239:58]. Essentially, all you've done is take all that out and you've done an O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and then ended up with an H<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 49 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 49 24 England:</b> Okay at 267:00 [242:48]-</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 49 30 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 49 31 England:</b> Change our - the High Gain Pitch and Yaw to Pitch, 9; Yaw, 257.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 49 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 49 43 England:</b> From 268:10 [243:23] to 268:40 [243:53] - You're gonna love this. Schedule a TV press conference.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 04 Mattingly:</b> You knew we had it stowed, didn't you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 09 England:</b> Well, we just waited ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 11 Mattingly:</b> You knew we took two hours to do that yesterday.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 12 England:</b> ...until you had tucked it away.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 18 England:</b> Okay, at 268:30 [243:43], delete "Charge Bat A."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 34 Mattingly:</b> That's done.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 35 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 36 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 37 England:</b> At 269:23 [244:36], delete "Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover, Close; X-Ray, Standby; and Verb 49 maneuver to thermal attitude." Delete that whole block.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 50 53 England:</b> Okay, delete all activities between 269:55 [245:08] and 270:10 [245:23] - Mass Spec, RCS jet test.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 51 30 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead, Tony.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 51 31 England:</b> Okay, at 270:50 [246:03], change your Verb 49 attitude to 090, 180, 010.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 51 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, 090, 180, 010, at 270:50 [246:03].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>235 51 52 England:</b> Okay, and your High Gain attitudes there are Pitch, minus 75; Yaw, 40.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>236 52 57 Duke (onboard):</b> It worked great. You just cutting that meat.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 01 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. That seemed to work out pretty good (garble) pretty good?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 07 Young (onboard):</b> We should have done that all along - I guess.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. We should have (garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 11 Young (onboard):</b> Don't know it, until you do it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 12 Duke (onboard):</b> (Garble) ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 13 Young (onboard):</b> We ought to recommend that to the 17 guys.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 15 Mattingly (onboard):</b> The trouble is, you know, you try to talk to the guys before the flight about this and ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 17 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) about a year before the flight.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 20 Mattingly (onboard):</b> ...things like how you defecate, how (garble) you have to be. They ain't gonna listen.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 26 Young (onboard):</b> Why, no.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 29 Mattingly (onboard):</b> What else (garble)(garble) probably won't pay any attention (garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 36 Duke (onboard):</b> The only - I did listen to Stu Roosa on that thing (garble) He said get naked and be prepared to get stuff all over your hands. And it happened.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 46 Crew (onboard):</b> (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 53 50 Young (onboard):</b> Just like he said, huh? There's no consolation in that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 04 Young (onboard):</b> Careful.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 06 Duke (onboard):</b> John, what can we do on the stowage or something that - maybe just to occupy my mind ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, you know they got a geology debrief for you guys at 262 hours.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 15 Young (onboard):</b> When is the press conference?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 18 Mattingly (onboard):</b> At 268.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 19 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 21 Mattingly (onboard):</b> And I really want to - I want to take some photographs of the - of the (garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 31 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> And I would like to take photos (garble) while you guys eat - interior photos (garble)?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 41 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I really think - I need (garble) - the only thing that you could really have (garble) is plastic (garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 50 Young (onboard):</b> You can't get that. I (garble) them my lightweight headset. I got to try that thing. Is there a way to get that? It's down there in the A-8, isn't it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 56 Mattingly (onboard):</b> It's a pain.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 58 Duke (onboard):</b> I'm going to take mine off ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 54 59 Mattingly (onboard):</b> ...(garble) supposed to be. They're absolutely worthless.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 55 02 Young (onboard):</b> You want to wear these things for the press conference?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 55 04 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Think that's only way they can hear you.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 55 07 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 55 10 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's wh - one reason I've been wearing mine all the time is it's the only way I can get Houston. The DSE won't pick up the lightweight set hardly at all, unless you do what Charlie is doing, otherwise you won't be (garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 55 21 Young (onboard):</b> Probably be better if you ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>236 55 23 Duke (onboard):</b> Take off your neck.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>237 11 49 England:</b> Okay. I tried to get Hank to send this up, but he wouldn't touch it either. I guess we'd like John on the biomed today and Charlie on it tonight. And just a reminder, for today we'd like items 5 and 6 in the crew status recorded.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 12 10 Young:</b> Yeah, we - We're working both of those problems in.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control, Houston; 262 hours, 3 minutes [237:16] Ground Elapsed Time. We're standing by now for the geology.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 16 48 England:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. Whenever you're ready for the geology, we'll press on with that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 16 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Ready, John?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 16 59 Young:</b> Yeah, we're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 17 01 England:</b> Okay. Our first question here on the portable magnetometer - I forgot to re - I forgot to ask you. It was my omission. I was wondering what the temp label on the - on the electronics box read, if you remember.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 17 21 Young:</b> Tony, you got to be kidding.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 17 24 England:</b> I was afraid of that. Okay. And for Charlie there, we'd like to verify that on the third EVA when he was driving out to Station 11 with the polarizer on, that he used nominal camera settings. He didn't allow for the polarizer.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 17 51 Duke:</b> I did just what was on the top of the camera, Tony. Filter - I used 5.6 at 1/250 in the right position.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 18 01 England:</b> Okay. That's fine - that's great - That's what we needed to know. Okay. The next question we'll - we'll get when we get the rocks back, but I think - Well, maybe the best way to do this is to describe a theory that's coming up as a result of the rocks you've - that you saw there. It looks as if - or - A possibility is that an older theory that was discarded a few years ago may be the right one, that the Cayley is an outer fluidized ejecta from Imbrium. Fra Mauro would be an inner ring, and then Imbrium sculpture would be outside of that, and then the Cayley would be sort of slosh that filled up all the valleys farther on out. But some of the questions that the geologists are - are pressing here is something that might help them define that. And a lot of it is that they're just - can't wait for the rocks to get back. But anyway, at Station 11, you described some rocks you thought to be tuff. Looking back at Station 5 and 6, after seeing these at 11, do you think you might have seen the same kind of rock there? What we're thinking about is where you described the - the square crystals and the needle-like crystals in clasts. And also, in the same question, were these crystals by themselves or were these - I mean, were the cras - clasts single crystals or were the crystals in clasts? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 19 38 Duke:</b> Recalling Station 11, the - the rocks - that big rock in particular was a two-rock breccia, and - I feel. And within the - within the bluish-black matrix, which made up one clast - one of the rock types - there were needle-like crystals in that. And the white matrix also had crystals in it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 20 19 England:</b> Okay. And how - how does - how did those rocks compare to what you saw at station 5 - 5 and 6?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 20 31 Young (onboard):</b> I knew they were going to ask these questions. I - may be - </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 20 40 Young:</b> Tony, I'm afraid I'm not gonna do any better with the answer to these questions than I do on an average field geology trip where you got 10 stations. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 20 49 England:</b> Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 20 50 Young:</b> And the rocks - You know, the rocks that we're picking up at 5 and 6 - that was a long time before Station 11 and - </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 21 00 England:</b> Understand. Don't - don't worry about it ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 21 01 Young:</b> And I can't remember what the dang rocks looked like, to be honest with you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 21 04 England:</b> We're gonna have an antenna switch.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 21 11 Duke (onboard):</b> I think there were some of the same, John.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 21 14 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, but I mean it's entirely speculative to answer a question like that on ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 21 34 England:</b> Okay. I'll try to stick here to questions that were impressions, and we're going to get the rocks back anyway. I don't - I don't really think there's any point in pressing - pressing with questions where we'll get the answers in a few days. Outbound on EVA-3, you noted one to five-meter craters. And then, 10-meters craters going north and you called them secondaries. We're wondering what evidence there was that - if any, that they came from North Ray. Do you think you saw any secondaries from North Ray? And if so, where would they be? And could you compare them to the size and character of the South Ray secondaries?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 22 21 Duke:</b> There was out - out around Palmetto. There were a couple of craters, if I recall - I don't know - exactly whether it was Palmetto or not, but as you're going out that way, there were some craters with some blocks in them. And that's the reason I called it secondary. They - they were not as fresh - in fact, craters going toward North Ray were a lot more subdued than the craters going down to Stone Mountain. The North Ray had - something had - either they're older or something, but they were a lot more subdued and there was less blocks around. But we did have one or two that had some blocks in them, and that's why I called them secondaries.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 23 13 England:</b> Okay. Were the blocks as angular as the ones you described from South Ray?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 23 23 Duke:</b> In general, our impressions were no.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 23 26 England:</b> Okay. As you were coming off of - and going up into North Ray area, could you give a guess at the relative proportions of - and the size and shapes of the white and the dark rocks.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 23 51 England:</b> In other words, was there a change ra - radially outward from North Ray?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 24 04 Young:</b> Yeah, this is just an impression, Tony. But I'd say that the - that the dark rock was less prevalent as you went outbound, generally speaking - as you went away from the crater.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 24 21 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 24 22 Young:</b> I could be 100 percent out - wrong on that. But we sure drove over a lot of - in the regolith there in particular. The upper layer in regolith, which contained these - I mean the - the ejecta blanket - which contained - the upper layer in the ejecta blanket contained a lot of boulders with just their heads sticking through, and those were the ones I was looking at because I was trying to go around them. And they - and I don't ever remember seeing a - a dark brecc - breccia-like rock in those boulders.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 25 01 England:</b> Okay, sounds good. And that very large rock you sampled up there, Charlie, you mentioned there was white and dark rock in the one rock. Could you describe the contact? Was one contained in the other, or did the contact meander through the whole rock?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 25 18 Duke:</b> Just sort of meandered through, Tony. It was a - it was a - again I'll say a two-rock breccia, where it was a white and the black. And the clasts were very large, up to a meter size. I think the - the predominant rock was black. At least, the overall color gave you a black, but when you looked closely, you could see white clasts in it. So the - and the contact just meandered. I think we've got a couple of close-ups of - of how the contact just meandered through. It was sort of a angular clast in this predominantly blackish matrix.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 26 03 England:</b> Okay. The white rock, was it - that was in this big boulder - was it like the white rock that you sampled to the southwest of where you parked the Rover?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 26 14 Duke:</b> Yes, it was all - yes, uh-huh.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 26 17 England:</b> Okay. Incidentally, that shadow cone that. you saw on the big boulder - Did it - Did the surface on the cone go right through the clasts, or did the clasts poke out kind of like nodules on the cone?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 26 35 Duke:</b> Well, they - No, it didn't. The shadow cone was in - was fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, in - in the black matrix. And it was - it was a crystalline rock where the shadow cone occurred.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 26 50 England:</b> Okay. Understand. Okay. Now that you've seen both North and South Ray ejecta blocks, could you say a few - a little bit about the ray material in the area from the LM to Flag? Do you feel that all that material is characteristic of the bigger ray blocks that you identified near either North Ray or South Ray?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 27 24 Young:</b> Yeah. I ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 27 26 England:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 27 27 Young:</b> I guess my impression might be that some - at some places, we had some of each and - but most of it was from South Ray. And around the LM, I'm - We saw - Once we got going toward North Ray, those - that material around the LM, by gosh, the breccia - and I collected several of them at that last Station - in hand specimens - some of them were like the material we got out of South Ray, clear of South Ray blanket, and - but several of them were from North Ray. At least, that was my impression.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 28 14 England:</b> Okay. Understand, We always had the feeling ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 28 17 Young:</b> I'd say the most of them for - from South Ray.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 28 19 England:</b> Okay. We seem to have the feeling that the rocks you were describing in the LM area were just somehow just a little bit different than what you were picking up either down South or up North. I guess we'll get that all straight when the rocks get home.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 28 36 Duke:</b> Tony, I think that's - that the breccias were different. We've been - Maybe I'm going way out on a limb when I say this, but you - we've been collecting little fragments that have been floating around the cockpit here and looking at them, and they're crystalline - crystalline fragments that - with little white powdery exterior on part of it, and it - chalky appearance. And to me, this is - was characteristic of the rocks - some of the rocks around the Cayley, which - now I'm really leading to a tuff breccia - but the matrix being the ash with these crystalline frags, and the crystalline frags looked just like the rocks - the crystalline rocks around North Ray. At least, the black ones - at least, the couple I found here floating around. Now that's not to say that the fragments are - there are some fragments from whitish rocks, but they were a little bit dif - more difficult to see in this white matrix of what looks like tuff now, because it's very powdery.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 30 03 England:</b> Okay. Understand. I wonder if you could describe that - those vesicles in that rock at Station 13.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 30 15 Duke:</b> Well, they looked like - I call them drill holes. Let's see if John has a different word for it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 30 37 Young:</b> They look like those pipes that you see in rocks. Like Charlie says, they just look like drill holes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 30 48 England:</b> Okay. Understand ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 30 49 Young:</b> And they were about a couple of - up to 2 to 3 centimeters across.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 00 England:</b> Okay ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 01 Young:</b> ...in diameter, and perfectly circular. It appeared to me to be.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 04 England:</b> And how deep did they go? Could you tell - I mean, did they go straight in, or did they seem to meander around?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 12 Young:</b> They seemed to go straight in, and I couldn't tell how deep they were, because they only go in a - They disappear from sight. I didn't try reaching into any of them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 21 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 22 Duke:</b> Tony, they were - there wasn't anything in them. You could just look in and you'd just - and they looked clean, and - and - just like somebody drilled out the rock.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 34 England:</b> How about the orientation? Were they all perpendicular to the surface, or did they all have a preferred orientation?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 31 49 Duke:</b> I got the impression that they were parallel to the - to the surface. The rock was - As you stood and faced the rock, you could see - see these little holes sticking out at you that - with most of them parallel to the - to the regolith.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 32 13 England:</b> Okay. How about when you went around on the other side? Did they poke out at you there, or were the - What I'm trying to get a feeling is - Did it indicate a top and bottom in the rock, or did it just poke out all over the rock?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 32 33 Duke:</b> I'm - We don't - we only remember seeing them on one side, Tony. And that was the south side or the east side of the rock. The rock was facing - the side we saw them on was away from North Ray.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 32 46 England:</b> Okay. Understand.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 33 01 Duke (onboard):</b> You need some help with that, John?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 33 03 Young (onboard):</b> I'll make it, I think. It's run off somewhere.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 33 09 England:</b> Okay. And - Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 33 51 England:</b> Okay. Charlie, just before you left the - or during the LM closeout time, you started to make a remark about the change in character between the regolith - between the LM area and Stone Mountain, and somehow we got interrupted there and you didn't finish your statement. I wonder if you could finish what you're going to say - if you happen to remember? Can you characterize the difference in regolith between the LM area and Stone Mountain?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 34 25 Duke:</b> Stand by one on that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 34 27 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 34 29 Duke (onboard):</b> Did -</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 34 32 Young (onboard):</b> What you say, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 34 33 Duke (onboard):</b> Those two regoliths seemed to be pretty - pretty much the same, sort of loosely consolidated and you sink right in. The one that I thought was impressive was up at North Ray where you - where it was very shallow, and you didn't sink in at all. Did you - do you remember anything being different about the two regoliths - between the LM and Stone?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 34 59 Young (onboard):</b> No, I sure don't. We never stopped between the LM ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 35 02 Duke (onboard):</b> No, I mean between - say, up on Stone Mountain and at the LM.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 35 09 Young (onboard):</b> Well, the one up at Stone Mountain was clearly a - We just sunk in more because of a lot of down-slope debris ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 35 15 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 35 16 Young (onboard):</b> ...in there. I'm sure of that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 35 22 Duke:</b> Tony, I think that - We're just sitting here trying to decide - recall, and I - right now the only impression is that you tended to sink in more up on Stone Mountain, which could be down-slope movement of particles, and - It was a - just very loosely consolidated up there. Everywhere you'd - you'd step, you'd sink in a couple of inches. And on the slopes around the LM, it was the same way. And even, in fact, where we landed. Up around the ALSEP site, it was very loosely consolidated, and as you walked you could - your foot would leave quite a imprint. And once we had pretty well turned over the surface around the LM and up on Stone, it would look like freshly raked ground and - to me. Stone Mountain - Smoky Mountain - or excuse me, North Ray, wasn't like that at all. It was very thin regolith and as we commented, we had a tough time raking because it was so rocky right up - within a couple of centimeters, at the top of the regolith. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 36 47 England:</b> Okay. Understand. I think your down-slope movement there on Stone was probably - probably right. Although that wouldn't explain why it was harder at 5 and 6 than at 4. Well, anyway. Next question here - On that half-orange-sized rock that you put on the LPM, wonder if you could estimate - estimate how common that type rock was around.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 37 22 Duke:</b> Well, John picked up one just like it up on - It was a grab sample up on Sto - yes, Stone Mountain. And it was one of the crystalline rocks with that sugary crystalline texture to it.
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 37 38 Young (onboard):</b> Like whitish rock?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 37 40 Duke (onboard):</b> Huh?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 37 41 Young (onboard):</b> It was the whitish rock?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 37 42 Duke:</b> Huh? Yeah. And it was one of those whitish rocks that was a little dusty. I think that - I think it's fairly common. We'll just have to see when we get the samples back, but it was my impression it was one of the three predominant rock types there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 37 56 England:</b> Okay. Understand. And the soil at Station 8 - was it white underneath the top surface like you described up at Station 4 and a lot of other stations?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 38 16 Duke (onboard):</b> I can't remember. I don't think so. Do you remember that, John?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 38 27 Young:</b> We kicked - we kicked some of that, and I - I can't remember whether it was or not at Station 8.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 38 36 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 38 37 Young:</b> I think it - Anyway, we sampled the soil sample there, and it's in the - it's in - it's in the box somewhere. But I can't - I certainly can't remember whether it was a - white underneath or not.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 38 51 England:</b> Okay. Understand. And just subjectively, could you compare - now that you've been up fairly close to Smoky and on Stone - could you compare the two - two structures?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 39 09 Young:</b> They looked the same to us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 39 13 England:</b> Okay. Well, that's all of the geology...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 39 15 Young:</b> I - Okay, I wouldn't be surprised but what they aren't the same. When Ken and I and Charlie looked at it in this real low Sun angle, I - I guess that's - As far as geometric form, it certainly looked - it was the hummocky material from the Descartes region is the way it looked. Right across Smoky - right through that whole region, it looked like a single unit, and - and I guess that would be my interpretation of it at this point. But it's pure speculation, but I would guess that tonight. I wouldn't be surprised but that we don't find a lot of these rock types on one region very close to another region being about the same.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 40 08 England:</b> Okay. Understand. The reason ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 40 09 Duke:</b> Tony - That was - I was just going ...
      <p class="tech"><b>237 40 13 England:</b> Go ahead, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 40 14 Duke:</b> ...to add to that, I was just - I had the same impression. Looking at the - the South Ray, with the black and white streaks up the wall - up on the interior of the crater, and also at Baby Ray, being very stark in contrast. And then in North Ray, having that same impression but more subdued. And the rocks appearing to be very similar - I think there's a good lateral - and you guys can demolish this when you analyze the rocks, but right now my impression is that - the - the two craters penetrated are very similar - or two very similar rock units. The white and the bluish black.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 41 11 England:</b> Okay. Understand. The reason for a lot of these questions - and we know the answers are in the rock boxes and bags there and we'll all get when you get home. But there's a lot of interest since the model - the model that we have of the whole area is being changed because of the high aluminum to silicon ratios and because of all of your rock descriptions there. And everybody's ...Well, we switched antennas there. There's a lot of push here to reformulate a new model. The press is kind of pushing, and you'll probably get some questions this afternoon in your press conference. I was wondering if there's anything you wanted to ask the geology team about this - this new model, since I don't think you've ever been briefed on it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 42 09 Duke:</b> No, I'd sure never heard it was slosh from the Imbrium at the Cayley.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 42 14 Young:</b> I'd say it's premature to be making those kind of statements, Tony. And I would like to wait until we get all that data in and take a look at it. It's just too soon to be on - on hearsay and - and - and not having the real evidence and not having the - all the data analyzed. It's too soon to be making any major conclusions about the region. It's just - I can't see how you could do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 42 38 England:</b> I sure agree with you, John. But, you know, everybody's - Everybody's excited and trying to press with it. But, anyway, I thought you might want to - to hear a little bit about that, if you're going to be asked on it this afternoon. That isn't - Now, of course, that isn't to say anyone's saying that Kant Plateau or Descartes Highlands are slosh. It's just the Cayley part. Anyway, that's all - that's all we have here, if you just want to press on there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 43 11 Young:</b> No, I just don't see how you can come to that conclusion this quick without any evidence, Tony. It's - It'd be nice to do that, but I - boy, I would - I would not press for that sort of thing this early in the game. And I wouldn't answer questions to anybody to amount to anything on that kind of stuff because that's too speculative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 43 30 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 43 31 Young:</b> In other words, it ain't good - it ain't good science.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 43 35 England:</b> Yeah, John. I think - I think you're right on, and I hope they heard you in the backroom, because I - I think I said the same thing this morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 43 59 England:</b> And we have a slight change to the Flight Plan at 264:10. We'd like to change the Noun 79 deadband to 2 degrees.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 44 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The Noun 79 changed to 2 degrees at 264:10.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 44 24 England:</b> Roger. And I'll see y'all tonight. I'll come back and tuck you in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>237 44 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Tony. Thank you.</p>

Tell EECOM we got some good pictures of a dump when we were station-keeping up there while y'all were deciding whether we could land. Ken did his dump, and we had perfect lighting for it and so we got some DAC film of it and it was really coming out of there.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>237 53 48 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah. John and I were just talking. Our - my theory is that the Cayley - We did see some endogenic craters and that - and that - the Cayley is really a tuff breccia - the - the - the plain, and it - because the crystals in this tuff are the same - like this one right here - looked the same as those big rocks that we found up at North Ray and also in the adja - in the secondary craters out of South Ray.

      <p class="obcm"><b>237 57 05 Duke (onboard):</b> Observations in the rocks we picked up.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 57 07 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 57 10 Duke (onboard):</b> That the rocks in that South Ray ejecta are the same as the rocks at North Ray. So at least to the depth that they penetrated, there was some crystalline rocks at least to those depths - at those depths. The rocks came out, and there they are; they got to come from somewhere . And then, covering this - all this, and probably ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 57 31 Young (onboard):</b> (Yawn)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 57 32 Duke (onboard):</b> ...predating, at least predating the - the - the event, the South Ray event, there was a volcanic episode of - of - of pretty pyroclastic nature that created a tuff breccia, and the clasts in the brec - in the tuff are the same as the rocks - as the crystalline rocks that you brought back from the secondary craters.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 58 00 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) hypothesis (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 58 0h Young (onboard):</b> Well, I think they've oversimplified the thing.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 58 06 Duke (onboard):</b> They do.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 58 07 Young (onboard):</b> The first thing, I think, is that probably that whole area was a big impact thing to start with, see? So then on top of that then happens all these things that Charlie's talking about, and then after that - a while later - happens the Imbrium event.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 58 21 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>237 58 22 Young (onboard):</b> And I don't think the Imbrium event had beans to do with what went on there. Because I don't think any of those rocks look anything like what they - those guys got up on the -</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>239 18 23 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We understand that, Ken.

      <p class="tech"><b>239 21 53 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Ken. We'd like to do it in that same procedure that - that Tony read to you this morning. And, for the next one at about 275:50, we'll go back to the regular procedures.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And you want to use the same jets that Tony read me this morning?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 10 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And those, I guess, should be the ones you have enabled now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 20 Mattingly:</b> Except I got - this morning I had all B/D Rolls enabled.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 26 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we'd like to start up in single jet, which is what you have now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll use the jet configuration I have now, then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 42 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And, I guess - did Tony read you the change that we wanted the 2-degree dead band?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 49 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 50 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 22 52 Mattingly:</b> And how about the rate? Now, he read me 0.3 this morning, and normally we do 0.42. I take it 0.3 is what you're really after.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 23 03 Hartsfield:</b> Let me double-check that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 23 15 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, 0.3 is the correct rate.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 23 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 23 34 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, when we get to attitude, we'd just like to hold that before you start the P20, so we can dump the tape recorder.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>239 27 19 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, we need to get the High Gain, and I guess we need you to do a Manual Roll about 30 degrees left.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>239 27 41 Hartsfield:</b> And, in regard to the urine dump coming up, the doctors think they see a correlation between the urine dump times and the dump port temperature. So, just to see if this really works, and if it does work, we may be able to get rid of all of this recording stuff. We'd like for you to identify which bags you are dumping and give us a mark at start and the end of the dump.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 28 10 Mattingly:</b> Run that by one more time, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 28 13 Young:</b> Looks like you guys don't understand the problem, do you? I can't believe that. We all dumped the urine into the same bag.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 28 24 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, give us a start and stop.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 28 26 Young:</b> We been stowing - yeah, but, Hank, we're all dumping into the same big white bag and then that gets dumped over to the side. Is that what you want? A total volume from all three of us?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 29 17 Young:</b> Did you get my last, Henry?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 29 20 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. They still would like to know the start and stop times.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 29 27 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Be our guest.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 29 29 Young:</b> What do you - start and stop of what? You know, we let this thing purge, line out, and then we let it sit there until we're sure everything's all cleaned out - afterwards, to make sure we don't plug things up. I guess we can tell you when we do each step, but we don't really know when those bags are empty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 29 44 Hartsfield:</b> Well, that would be my guess, also, but can you guess at it? Okay, if you can't, forget it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 29 55 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 30 24 Young:</b> Okay, Henry. Here's what we've been doing with the urine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 30 50 Young:</b> Is this attitude okay for you, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 30 56 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 31 03 Hartsfield:</b> John, could you repeat what you said. INCO cut the antenna off about the time you started?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 31 25 Young:</b> Houston, is this attitude okay for the High Gain?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 31 27 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. It's a good attitude.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 31 32 Young:</b> Okay, now. Let me tell you what we've been doing with this stuff. We've been using the Gemini [?] bags and then dumping it into a big white bag. And it's all in there now, all mixed together, and nobody knows whose is whom's. And - and, furthermore, we don't know when we dump that big white bag when - We know when we start to do it, but we don't know whenever it finishes. Because you can't see the inside of the bag. You just don't have a feel for that. So, what you just do is you just let it run until you think you ought to quit and look and see if you've got particles on the outside. And even after you quit, there's still particles on the outside.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 32 13 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy, John. Why don't we forget about that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 32 21 Young:</b> Okay. I would be glad to do it, if I thought it would give you any data. But I can't see how it'll give you anything you could use.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 32 30 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, John. What we're trying to do is find some way to make the procedures a little cleaner on - on Apollo 17. So they think they can get some useful data out of this, and if you can just give us a mark when you start, maybe they, from the temperature curves, can tell just about when it ends. They got a - they're trying to get a calibration on how the temperature of the port changes during the dump.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 33 01 Young:</b> Yeah, but - are you sure that, for example, that we don't have at least thousands of chamber dumps that'll tell you the same thing?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 33 22 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. They said the chamber data is what got them looking at the possibility of doing this.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 33 29 Young:</b> Okay, Hank, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll give you mark when we start and a mark when we stop.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 33 36 Hartsfield:</b> Thank you.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>239 41 03 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. When you get ready to dump the waste water, we'd like to dump to 49 percent. That'll leave us enough for the Skylab contamination.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 41 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay, dump to 49 percent.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 41 41 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. We can go ahead and start spinning up, but first we've got to load the Verb 49 with a current roll attitude and Pro going to attitude and then start the spinup. And for the spinup, we'd like to use Delta 2 in addition to the jets you now have configured so we can get a couple of spinups, and then turn Delta 2 back off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 42 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we add Delta 2 for the start and then turn it off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 42 11 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>239 52 59 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, I guess you've figured out the reason we got caught there is we can't load the Noun 79 in Option 2.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>239 53 21 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, you restarted it after going to Accel Command, is that right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>239 53 28 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I restarted it, then didn't mean to stop it, just kind of kept it going. Is that attitude looking all right or - I don't have any way of reading out where the dead band is centered now. Would you like for me to just stop and start all over again?</p>

We're at 265 hours, 6 minutes [240:19] Ground Elapsed Time. We show Apollo 16 at a distance of 117,608 nautical miles away from the Earth and travelling at a speed of 5,242 feet per second.

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 19 12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I've had more high heart rates in the last two weeks than I have in my whole life.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 19 18 Young (onboard):</b> Pretty exciting business.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 19 21 Mattingly (onboard):</b> The thing that galls me about these shrinks and everybody else is - just like the way they tackle zero g in the body. Instead of fighting the thing and trying to make you live in a protected environment, you ought to learn to live in the environment you're in.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 19 34 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 19 36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Let man adapt to zero g. Quit trying to force his body to stay in one-g condition, because it isn't gonna work.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 19 45 Young (onboard):</b> But if you provide him with one g, it ain't gonna work. I've been trying to tell them that.

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 19 55 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Right. And there's no future in that. That negates all the reasons for going into zero g.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 20 00 Young (onboard):</b> Well, and there's - you know - there's places on a spacecraft you could make it on, where you could put a - you could - you could put some (garble) ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 20 07 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, but it's not productive. You'd have to spend 6 hours, 8 hours a day doing that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 20 12 Young (onboard):</b> You'd have to spend a lot of time in your zero ...</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 20 32 Mattingly (onboard):</b> And you just learn to live with that. The only place I see a hazard is in recovery. If you had to really exert yourself ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 20 40 Young (onboard):</b> Then that's really what we'd do, you watch.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 20 43 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I think I'd find a way to do that (laughter).</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 21 31 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Until they get a collar around this thing, I ain't going to be very comfortable, because my experiences with the Stable II egress from this son of a gun have always been bad (laughter).</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 22 05 Mattingly (onboard):</b> The problem is, people have been setting focuses wrong, for one thing. What - what is the proper intensity to set this thing? I think these particles are real bright.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 25 55 Young (onboard):</b> He can do it with G&N controls.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 25 56 Duke (onboard):</b> How do you do that?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 25 57 Mattingly (onboard):</b> CDUs only talk to the computer.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 25 58 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 25 59 Mattingly (onboard):</b> They don't talk to the eight ball. And it - it thinks inertially. The platform just sits there and it does its thing, and it takes those accelerometers and integrates them and says, man, you need to go a little long. And if you needed to go long, you ought to have 112 degrees bank, and we just roll 112 and we'll plop it right in the same place the computer ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 16 Young (onboard):</b> You'd have to adapt it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 17 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. But it's got the same accuracy that the G&N has.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 25 Young (onboard):</b> We already found that out, didn't we?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 27 Duke (onboard):</b> I hate to tell you, but that brought on a "Shhh."</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 30 Crew:</b> (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 33 Young (onboard):</b> We'd better hurry. We got to give a TV show in ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 35 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 37 Young (onboard):</b> ...in 3 hours.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 38 Duke (onboard):</b> Three hours?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 41 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, thanks. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 43 Duke (onboard):</b> Do you want to dump your stuff down here, Ken?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 45 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, I guess.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 46 Duke (onboard):</b> Or do you want me to do it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 48 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Let me stop and take a second look. That sure got my attention. I thought John was playing games ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 26 57 Duke (onboard):</b> I turned around and looked at that, and I saw the PGNS light and the ISS light on down there.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 05 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, at this point, I feel pretty comfortable even without the PGNS. Because ain't nobody going to No-Go entry.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 15 Young (onboard):</b> That's for sure.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 16 Mattingly (onboard):</b> At least not up my watch.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 18 Duke (onboard):</b> I'd sure like - like to have that guidance working, though.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 22 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, got to have a little stick time.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 28 Duke (onboard):</b> It's a mighty big ocean.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 29 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter) I would like for it to come in automatically, too, Charlie; don't worry. My desire to be a hero does not mean I want to fly manually, just to prove you can do it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 42 Young (onboard):</b> Now, Ken, you can do it. And I want you to prove it. (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 46 Mattingly (onboard):</b> We will - if we need to, we will put it down right there, but I'd just as soon go automatic. I believe in computers.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 54 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, I believe in computers, too.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 27 57 Duke (onboard):</b> That - that warning light was like going in the gym, Ken. (Laughter) Automatic constipation reliever (laughter).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 07 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Man, I'll tell you, the way I've been - the way I've been having to go lately (laughter). I'm really getting worried; if I were in the gym now, I would never stop.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 16 Duke (onboard):</b> Are you going to dump that thing through a filter and everything, Ken?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 19 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No. I'm going to dump it through the little filter.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 22 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 23 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I got to use the other end of that big filter ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 25 Duke (onboard):</b> Close it. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 26 Mattingly (onboard):</b> ...of the urine hose here.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 31 Young (onboard):</b> Now promise me you're not going to clog up the urine tube. You ain't gonna promise me that, are you? (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 38 Duke (onboard):</b> John?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 40 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 41 Duke (onboard):</b> This is the last dump anyway.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 43 Hartsfield:</b> (Garble) ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Have - have - ask him to hold on.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 47 Hartsfield:</b> ...(Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Ask him to hold on and we'll be there. And the Mal Procedures are up there in the little (garble) box.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 55 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay. Stand by.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 28 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That - they're in that box that's so hard to get to, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 00 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah, I know.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 01 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's normal. Gosh. Who turned the lights off? We got a burned out light in one of the pumps down here. Let's see, scissors. Hold that for a second.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 17 Duke (onboard):</b> Can you reach it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 21 Young (onboard):</b> What could that be about?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 25 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Could what be about? The first thing I'd do is run a P52 and see if it knows where it is.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 37 Young (onboard):</b> No, it's a - The REFSMMAT flag is still set.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> We can check all those ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 46 Young (onboard):</b> The angles are good; it's got to know where it is, doesn't it? Better just keep your eye on that flag ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 51 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah, you - you could ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 52 Young (onboard):</b> ...auto - auto transient wouldn't kill the REFSMMAT flag, would it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 56 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Why don't we just go through this procedure and see what it says.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 00 29 57 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 29 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Let me take care of all those things in an orderly, thought-out fashion.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 02 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, okay. Why don't I just move over here, and...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 06 Mattingly (onboard):</b> How's the dump looking?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 11 Young (onboard):</b> Still dumping.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 14 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Man, on the - Look at that I Look at that!</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 16 Young (onboard):</b> You're dumping like crazy.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 18 Mattingly (onboard):</b> It worked.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 19 Young (onboard):</b> There it goes again. </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 20 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, we're in SCS mode. It doesn't matter.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 25 Young (onboard):</b> Watch it. Okay, we just had the program alarm again.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) first and two.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 47 Duke (onboard):</b> Here you go, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 51 Duke (onboard):</b> Here you go, John.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 52 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, I'll get it in a second. I got that purge ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 55 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Again?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 30 56 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 01 Young (onboard):</b> Drive us crazy.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 02 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, if it's a bit failure, we can avoid that by going around it. Let me get in there and work on that thing for a moment.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 16 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, I'm turning this thing off and it's not - the hose isn't hooked up to anything, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 21 Young (onboard):</b> What - what - what - what G&N? Number 6, is that the one that ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 25 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. That's the one. Why don't you let me in there ?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 35 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Why don't you let me slide in there, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 36 Duke (onboard):</b> Oh, excuse me.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, you're okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 39 Duke (onboard):</b> Reach it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 40 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. Hey, John?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 41 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> They slide in there.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 43 Young (onboard):</b> In here?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 45 Young (onboard):</b> Okay. Okay, the program alarm resets. This is a nuisance.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 51 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, let's - We've got nothing else to do.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 54 Young (onboard):</b> The answer is transient ISS condition.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 56 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 57 Young (onboard):</b> Program alarm reset.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 31 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 00 Young (onboard):</b> Spacecraft Control, SCS. And - Okay, then it says alarm code. No, the (garble) came off. It just came on again. Alarm code, ICDU to A/D check.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 21 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Did we get both the ISS and the program alarm?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 24 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 25 Duke (onboard):</b> I have P on the ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 26 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Every - every time?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 27 Young (onboard):</b> Every time to my - Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 28 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, I did - I haven't seen the ISS light.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 32 Duke (onboard):</b> Well, I - it is on down there.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 34 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's the PGNS light down there ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 35 Duke (onboard):</b> No, there's an I ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh, what's it look like?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 37 Young (onboard):</b> ...right there (garble) ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I only saw the ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 39 Young (onboard):</b> ...my ISS light wouldn't come on, and so ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 40 Duke (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Every time?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 43 Duke (onboard):</b> Every time.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 45 Young (onboard):</b> I've been watching it, because it goes out ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 46 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Does everybody ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 47 Young (onboard):</b> ...which is why you ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 48 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, but it goes out.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 49 Young (onboard):</b> I don't give a darn; I seen it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> All right, John. I'm not saying it didn't come on, I'm saying it goes out as soon as the condition goes away.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 53 Young (onboard):</b> Okay. Well, it's been going out just like that, too.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 32 55 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay. So it means that - right there, you know that it's a - it's a hardware-caused thing and not a software. And let her do ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 33 05 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, (garble) again?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 33 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's strange. Let's - let's do this thing, even if it only takes us to Block 5.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 33 17 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) get an answer.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 33 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, when we go into number 6 procedure, we come down, and the logical answer out of Block 2 is that the - you can reset the program lights and the ISS light goes off all on its own. It's only on for a very short period of time. And that says that it's a transient condition and stops. I -- guess we could take a look at going down through the "No" path and try Block 6, but I'd like to have some concurrence on that before we do it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 34 02 Hartsfield:</b> We concur - like for you to go to block 6.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 34 10 Mattingly:</b> You had some bad comm there; I understand you want us to go to Block 6.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 34 12 Hartsfield:</b> That is affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 34 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 34 16 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, let's do - let's do - why don't you do a Verb 16 Noun 23?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 34 23 Duke (onboard):</b> Y'all don't need the old LMP for that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 34 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Before we started on that, we've decided to take a look at 16 20 and it seems to be counting in all three axes. And they agree with what's on the FDAI. We're gonna start into Block 40 now. And I'm going on the Vox so I can talk and read at the same time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 34 58 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Ken. Before you do this, would you check yaw real carefully. We're showing about a degree difference between the ISS att and the ICDUs.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 35 09 Mattingly:</b> Say again, Hank. You - you were blocked out right in the middle.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 35 11 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Could you check the yaw axis real closely; we're showing about a degree difference down here. The other two axes look pretty good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 35 21 Mattingly:</b> I - I repeat, the FDAI and the Noun 20s look like they're in as close agreement as I can read. You can't tell a degree on the FDAI down here anyway. (last sentence is Young in the CM transcript] </p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 35 32 Young (onboard):</b> I mean, there's that much dispersion in the instrumentation. You know that. Idiots.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 35 32 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 35 33 Mattingly:</b> There's that much dispersion in the instrumentation. You know that. Okay; can we proceed?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 35 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, can we proceed?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 35 45 Hartsfield:</b> Proceed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 35 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we did. And it's counting again, and it's gone back to the same numbers - well, it just blanked again. Let's see here; maybe I was premature.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 36 07 Young (onboard):</b> What happened there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 36 15 Mattingly:</b> That's where it zeroed. Yeah, it's still showing about the same numbers, Hank. The biggest change was in the - no they're all - they're all ball park, within readability, from one reading to the other.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 36 36 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 36 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. So out of that, I come up with a "yes" answer, and I'm going - looking at block 12.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 37 00 Young (onboard):</b> Want to load that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 37 23 Mattingly:</b> I guess in order to do this block 12, I have to be in CMC Control, is that not correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 37 32 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by. SCS should be okay, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 37 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I had no displacement; I did a Verb 43 Enter, and I loaded R-1, 2, and 3 - and I got no needle displacement. Is another Enter required or something?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 38 06 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 38 24 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, we'd like for you to repeat the procedure, starting with the Verb 43, and do it very slowly so we can watch it down here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 38 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay; there's Verb 43 - Enter, plus 00250 Enter, plus 00333 Enter, plus 00333 Enter, and the needles pulsed out and right back to zero.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 39 12 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. The needles did jiggle, but they went back to zero.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 39 23 Mattingly:</b> That's correct.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 02 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 40 05 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Stand by a little bit, and we'll digest this a while.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 18 Mattingly (onboard):</b> What did he say?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 20 Duke (onboard):</b> Said stand by a little bit and they'll digest this.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 22 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh. Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 26 Young (onboard):</b> Let me ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 27 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, the very first thing to do is to just find out if I have a good alignment. It could well be the detec - the detection circuit.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 39 Duke (onboard):</b> What - what angle are we, Ken?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 42 Mattingly (onboard):</b> 180 roll, 40 degrees yaw, and 130 degrees in pitch.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 40 50 Duke (onboard):</b> You know, lots of times when those things happen, it depends on - you can just be in a certain attitude and it'll happen ...</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 265 hours, 29 minutes [240:42] Ground Elapsed Time. What we've been listening, to Ken Mattingly troubleshooting with the ground with the Guidance and Navigation. [The] Program Alarm came on onboard and this was the alarm code 03777 causing the - a warning to the Inertial Sub-System. He has been going through some malfunction procedures now it's - it's being assessed on the ground and we will stand by and continue to monitor as conversations develop. We presently show Apollo 16 at a distance of 116,365 nautical miles away from the Earth; velocity now reads 5,280 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 42 03 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I sure hope that that doesn't prove - You know, that's like McDivitt looking at that - what was it that happened there, and you could see he really made the right decision when he decided to delay the launch even though the information that made it the right decision occurred after he made his decision. (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 42 19 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, I get a chuckle out of that.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 46 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. Well, what I would like to do is to find out if we've lost that loop. Like right now, even if - even if the gimbals (garble), I'm not sure I would be willing to try to get the coarse align.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 46 46 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, but we've got 24 hours to find that out anyway.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>240 46 50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Hey, John, the only other thing besides the coarse align loop that I can think of that - that uses the D-to-A section -</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>240 47 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> It's a transient condition now anyhow. Maybe it'll get un-transient later on.</b>
      <p class="tech"><b>240 47 51 Mattingly:</b> Hank, looks like one other thing that would check the D-to-A's would be - how about if I load a - just a Noun 22 of all zeros, and then call up the Verb 62?</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>241 10 32 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, I see stars. Why don't you close up the - can you close up the (garble), you guys?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 10 36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, I'll close up the hatch for you. I can't believe the difference in 280 and 284 means a hill of beans - in this big marshmallow.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 11 22 Young (onboard):</b> Well, I could see stars there for a while.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 11 34 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 11 45 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay. Say when, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 11 47 Young (onboard):</b> If you can take you some shots, well - let me use the DSKY here. It's a better reference. I'll probably go ahead and do it and then I'll probably get a better hack on the attitude here.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 12 01 Young (onboard):</b> We got two stars out there and I don't know what they could be.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 12 06 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Probably Alpha and Beta Centauri.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 12 09 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) probably right. Is that where we're pointed now (garble)?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 12 12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 12 14 Young (onboard):</b> That's what they are (garble).</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>241 12 25 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, wait a minute, John. I - we'll use the DSKY.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; at 265 hours, 59 minutes [241:12] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 is now proceeding to an attitude to shine sunlight into the SIM bay. The next step will be to go to Program 52 to align the platform and check the Inertial Measuring Unit. We now show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 114,857 nautical miles. Velocity now reads 5,326 feet per second. This is Apollo Control, Houston. Ken Mattingly has moved the Apollo 16 into Program 52. This the platform alignment program. We're at 266 hours, 1 minute [241:14] Ground Elapsed Time.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 13 26 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, now I got all kind of stars up here. There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. I don't know what any of them are.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>241 13 57 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I'll give you the program (garble), John.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> He really didn't mean to just fly over to 280 roll.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>241 l4 13 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No. He meant go to a specific attitude. He just didn't bother to say what it was.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 18 Duke (onboard):</b> I thought he gave you 120.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 19 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, after I asked for it. I could have gone there the first time just as easy.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 27 Young (onboard):</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 29 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Sneeze) Excuse me. (Sneeze).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 32 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) and Beta Centauri?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 34 Mattingly (onboard):</b> It is?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 35 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You can get Menkent (garble) All right. Now we're going to throw ourselves to attitude rate Att Rate 2, Limit Cycle, On.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 49 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) sort of oriented ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 52 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) power must be on.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 55 Young (onboard):</b> Are we - are we oriented up north?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Towards the south.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 14 59 Young (onboard):</b> Towards the south.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 09 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, the first one is star 21.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 12 Young (onboard):</b> Star 21. Gonna have to go to Zero Optics, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 16 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yep.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 18 Young (onboard):</b> Zero to Off (garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 22 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You'll have to turn the Optics power on before you're going to get anything.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 24 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 25 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Turn the Optics power on first.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 27 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah; power on.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 28 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay; now Zero the Optics.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 31 Young (onboard):</b> They're Zeroed.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 34 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You did it after the Optics power was turned on?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 35 Young (onboard):</b> No, before.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, you got to do it after. Because that's the only way the computer gets its discrete.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 48 Young (onboard):</b> You go to Off and then back to Zero, right?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 15 50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. After the power's on. You have an SCS; you can go to Manual when the drive is finished. Whenever you feel like it, as a matter of fact.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 05 Young (onboard):</b> If I go to Off, that program light hasn't been on...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 11 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Huh?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 12 Young (onboard):</b> That program light?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 13 Mattingly (onboard):</b> What about it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 14 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) was on. Do I go back to Zero (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 18 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No, no - as long as you've been in there 15 seconds. And we'll just check it here.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 32 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, that's close enough.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 37 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, it's your computer.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 42 Young (onboard):</b> Twenty-one.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 16 58 Young (onboard):</b> Want me to do - try one?</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>241 17 09 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Laughter) I told you we were pointing south.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>241 17 13 Young (onboard):</b> I know you told me that, but I didn't see any stars out there. </p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>241 18 09 Young (onboard):</b> Phew! Boy, it's really getting bad, Ken.</p>
