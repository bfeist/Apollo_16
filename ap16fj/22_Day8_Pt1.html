        <p class="ed">[The PAO, Mission Control and Crew are using the updated GET, intended to align events to the Flight Plan. At this stage in the flight, the difference from the actual GET is 11 minutes and 50 seconds. See <a href="transcription.html#timings">here</a> for more details.]</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer (continued):</b> About 37 minutes showing on the wakeup clock until the crew of Orion is called for the start of their final days activity at Descartes landing site. Briefly summarized the EVA 3 activities will begin with some 45 minutes after depressurization being spent in the immediate area of the Lunar Module. Getting the LRV loaded with all the gear for the geological sampling. Getting everything prepared for the trek out to North Ray Crater. The arrival at North Ray Crater at what's called Stations 11 and 12 will be at 1 hour and 25 minutes after start of EVA. Total distance out to this particular point 4.9 kilometers. At 2 hours 30 minutes into EVA 3 they will return back some &frac12 kilometer, that is south from North Ray Crater to Station 13, arriving there some 4 minutes later. They will spend 20 minutes at Station 13 collecting documented samples and rake soil samples. Young and Duke will leave Station 13 at 4 hours and 5 minutes into EVA, return to what is called the 10 prime area, that is at Station 10 from EVA 2, going back again for a second look, therefore, it is called 10 prime. They will arrive at this location at 3 hours 31 minutes into EVA. Then they will return to the immediate area of the Lunar Module Orion at 4 hours and 5 minutes into the EVA and spend the remaining 55 minutes of the 5 hour EVA 3 in closeout. Parking - parking of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, stowing all the film gear for transfer into the Orion, all the sample bags, doing all the general housekeeping, grounds-keeping that has to be done prior to closing out the final EVA. The total distance estimated for the EVA 3, that is LRV mileage or kilometrage, will be 9.85 kilometers. Command Module Casper [is] nearing the end of its 45 - 45th lunar orbit some 17 minutes away from Loss of Signal. At 162 [hours] 16 [minutes plan GET, 162:05 actual GET], this is Apollo Control.</p>

        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 165 hours 2 minutes [164:50]. We've completed our shift handover in Mission Control. Flight Director Pete Frank, and the EVA team are now on. Spacecraft Communicator for the Lunar Module Orion is astronaut Tony England, and astronaut Hank Hartsfield is handling the communicator chores for the Command Module Casper. Flight Director for the Command Module is Don Puddy. At the present time Young and Duke aboard Orion, are preparing for their third period of extravehicular activity. The Flight Activities Officer estimates that they're pretty much on the planned time line for that. We expect that they'll be getting out of the Lunar Module a little after 166 hours, perhaps 166:10 to 25 [165:59 to 166:16], or between 9:45 and 10:00 am Central Standard Time. We'll continue to keep an eye on their progress and report and update that expected egress time, as necessary. During today's 5-hour extravehicular activity, primary activities will be concentrated on sampling the North Ray Crater region, and the vicinity of the Lunar Module. Departing the Lunar Module, the traverse [will] proceed to North Ray Crater. Along the normal traverses path, there will be a single station in the vicinity of the old Station 11 and 12 area at North Ray crater, and we expect to have the crew to spend about 1 hour, 5 minutes sampling at this station. Then returning from North Ray crater, along the outbound path, they'll make a 20-minute stop in the vicinity of the old station 13, which is about 1 kilometer from the rim of North Ray crater. And here they'll do some documented sampling as well as taking a rake soil sample of North Ray ejecta. They'll then return to the area of the Lunar Module. We expect that they'll spend about 34 minutes in this area, and we'll concentrate on additional sampling. In addition, John Young will obtain an additional Lunar Portable Magnetometer reading, both with and without a rock. In the case with the rock, they'll be sitting a rock on the instrument and attempting to measure the soft component of magnetism in the lunar sampling in effort to determine if the so called soft magnetism that we've seen on return samples is actually indigenous to the sample when it's picked up on the Moon, or if it perhaps something that's introduced to the sample by the electronic equipment, rotating motors and so on in the Lunar Module, or by some other magnetic field that it encounters on Earth. For the 55, final 55 minutes of the 5-hour EVA, Young and Duke will be going through closeout. Getting samples bagged up, and boxed up and back aboard the Lunar Module, getting everything buttoned up and ready for lift-off, before the time that they climb through the hatch and seal up Orion for the final time prior to LM lift-off. Ken Mattingly aboard Casper was awakened on the last revolution. He is now behind the Moon out of radio contact. We'll be reacquiring Casper in about 11 minutes, 50 seconds. Spacecraft now on its 47th revolution of the Moon. Mattingly is again in good spirits. He has a busy day ahead of him. Now, one of his major activities will be preparing for the rendezvous and subsequent docking later today. In conjunction with this, we read him up the preliminary procedures to the lunar orbit plane change manoeuvre. This puts the Command Module in the proper plane for the rendezvous and docking with the Lunar Module. That maneuver to be performed approximately [at] 169 hours, 10 minutes [168:59], but we'll refine that time. Our flight plan for that event is still not precise. We've got in block times, but not precise times, but on the scale it will appear to be about 169 hours, 15 [minutes] [169:04], and we'll as I say, getting a more precise time on that.

The Laser Altimeter now is getting about 65 percent, good altitude. We've had 1431 firings. Pan Camera is overexposing by one and a half f-stops, because of a bias in the exposure-command voltage. We're 47 frames ahead on that. The rest of the SIM bay apparatus is working real - nominal. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 25 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Has the X-Ray experiment detected anything that looks unusual about the Descartes area, or anything like that?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 26 03 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I'll see if I can get a reading on that.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> One additional change in our Flight Plan schedules which affects television. During the rendezvous and docking, we had originally planned to have television coverage of this. Because of the Lunar Module High Gain Antenna, the LMP's steerable antenna is not functioning, the Lunar Module operates on the Omni directional antennas. We experienced the problem prior to the LM landing where the relatively weak signal strength of the Lunar Module coupled with the comparatively much stronger signal strength from the Command Module High Gain Antenna was saturating the receivers on the ground stations and we were blocking LM communications. In order to avoid this sort of problem, we will not use the High Gain Antenna on the Command Module so that we get a more balanced signal strength level from the two vehicles and don't run into this saturation problem. Because we won't be using the Command Module High Gain Antenna, we also will not be able to receivetelevision during the rendezvous and docking activities.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 27 08 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, you're coming up on about 15 seconds to T-stop Pan Camera.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>165 29 08 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. What we'd like for you to do is take the Mass Spec all the way out and then retract it for 93 seconds.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 29 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That sounds reasonable. Going all the way out and back in for 93.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 29 24 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And that would get us back to the 10-foot point that I was just - just getting ready to call you for.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>165 33 37 Hartsfield:</b> All right. Take your time; I was just trying to get all this dirty work out of the way so you'd have an uninterrupted eat period.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 33 51 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter). Uninterrupted only by [the] solar corona [observations]. Okay. About PRD, 15054; 7 hours; and none. And yesterday - let's see - well, shoot! They don't even have Meal A in this book. I don't know why it's split this way, but - You can delete the - Well, the only thing I had out of Meal B that's on the list there is the graham crackers and the cocoa. I also had bacon squares, coffee, and some of that pineapple fruit cake, and an apricot bar, and orange juice, and another package of graham crackers spread out throughout the - the day. Meal C: You can delete the beef steak, and the chicken and rice, and the pecans. And you can add that lobster from Meal B.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 35 28 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We got that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 35 34 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That should finish that - fill in that square, okay?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 35 39 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, Ken? How's the air-to-ground been this morning? Has there been a lot of noise on it, or it's been clean to you?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 35 47 Mattingly:</b> Just as quiet as ever. Beautiful comm.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 35 50 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 37 55 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. Could you give us Retract on the Mass Spec boom, 20 seconds? That's a change, 20 seconds.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 38 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay; this is 20 seconds.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 38 18 Mattingly:</b> Coming in now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 38 35 Mattingly:</b> It's Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 38 37 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 40 25 Mattingly:</b> Hank, where is that extra crater that you said you had down. there?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 40 33 Hartsfield:</b> What was that, Ken?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 40 37 Hartsfield:</b> You said something about an extra crater down there. Aw, I've lost it now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 40 44 Hartsfield:</b> Oh. That was between Double Spot over where the LM was and down to the south there towards Stone Mountain. As they were coming back from the surface, it was very apparent there was a very large depression, a subdued crater. There was a - some - they estimated 300 meters, maybe even larger in diameter.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 41 06 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess I looked in the wrong place. I looked short of the landing area.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 50 55 Mattingly:</b> Henry, do you remember the little helmet-shaped...</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 50 57 Hartsfield:</b> Yeah.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 50 58 Mattingly:</b> ...area we had just south of the Riphaeus Mountains?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 51 01 Hartsfield:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 51 02 Mattingly:</b> They showed up in the color differentials. Well, it does have a different color to it. It's - in this sunlight, it seems like these - the things that were showing up on - those red-and-blue color differences - they're showing up more in the low-Suns. Because I can see the mare differences back by Lassell in low-Sun. And they don't show up so well now. And now this one shows up very dramatically as this little - little piece of [garble] out here. And it's kind of - it's just a little tanner than the rest of the mare.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 52 00 Hartsfield:</b> That's a little - kind of interesting to find out that the color's different there than the surroundings.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 52 10 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, and the texture is a little different, too. I got the binocs on it now. The mare has a large number of very small pits in it, as well as a - it's almost a random distribution of crater sizes. This little patch of ground has - oh, I guess about the same distribution of the larger craters, but the little pits don't show quite as much. It's a - it has a ropy texture across the top, not - not as ropy as a - as a pahoehoe flow or anything like that, but just kind of has a little pattern to it. It has some lineaments that run kind of - I guess that's sort of northwest. And it looks like it may be associated with these other little clumps of material that stick out around it here. And - I was trying to compare that to the Riphaeus Mountains, and it looks like - the material looks the same. And another thing I'd never noticed before that looking at the Riphaeus Mountains here - I'm looking at the - at the step of the - let's see, this eastern edge. And if you're - remember that back around Flamstead there's a little foot, a little toe or ring that goes around the inside. And the Riphaeus Mountains all have that little toe. Now whether that's a high-water mark or a second unit, it's hard to say. But all along the margin that I can see - there's that little toe. And it seems to be at the same elevation. And that's true for some of the little patches a little further back - back inland. It looks like a break in slope and a changing color both.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 54 45 Hartsfield:</b> What else do you see in there?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 54 50 Mattingly:</b> I see that it's getting dark outside, and it's time for an eat period inside.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 54 55 Hartsfield:</b> (Laughter). Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 54 59 Mattingly:</b> No, it's an interesting place, you just need to have more time to look at it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 55 17 Mattingly:</b> And I'm all set up for the solar corona. The cameras are all set. The checklist is complete down to turning the tape on.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 55 28 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Why don't you take time to eat then, and - I'll just check out with you at AO - at LOS.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 55 37 Mattingly:</b> All right, sir. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 55 48 Mattingly:</b> Maybe everyone else in the world knew about that little toe in the Riphaeus Mountains. I just never had heard anyone mention that before.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 55 58 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That sounds interesting.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 56 08 Hartsfield:</b> Farouk and the boys in the backroom have been eagerly absorbing your remarks the last couple of days.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 56 18 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, but all the questions they ask, I can't answer.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 57 12 Mattingly:</b> You know, Hank, one of the things I was thinking about last night that might help remember a lot of the things we've seen - do you suppose there's a - any DAC film that I can use to, say, set to look out the window? And I'll see if I can maybe just tape the DAC up somewhere and let it take a one-frame-per-second strip, or something that would give us some reasonable overlap - around the lighted part of the Moon.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 57 47 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We'll take a look at that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>165 57 54 Mattingly:</b> I think I could probably tape the camera somewhere so it would have a - a view approximately the same as what we've been seeing.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 03 53 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, no need to acknowledge. Your consumables look good, and, on the RCS, we're making a little money. We're about 188 pounds now above the rescue red line.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 04 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That sounds good.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 05 43 Mattingly:</b> Henry, are the surface guys out cranking up their little car yet?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 05 51 Hartsfield:</b> Yes, sir. They got out about 30 minutes early, and they are moving on out.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 08 40 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. John and Charlie are powering up the LRV now, and FAO says you're cleared to use magazine EE and KK. At the present, they are on schedule.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 08 59 Mattingly:</b> EE and KK. Okay, what kind are they? Are they CEX?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 09 04 Hartsfield:</b> Both of those are CEX.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 09 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And I'll just use the settings off the photo wheel the same as we use for the 250.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 09 18 Hartsfield:</b> That ought to work out okay, Ken.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 09 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 11 43 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we have been noting a little oscillation in the high gain at acquisition, and we were wondering if you're still noticing that discrepancy between the angles and the knobs when you're in the manual mode. It appears to us that it may be off a little bit in yaw.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 12 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll - I'll set them on the - I've been setting them on the dials rather than on the knobs.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 12 20 Hartsfield:</b> Right. That's preferable - to use the meter there.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 12 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 12 30 Hartsfield:</b> Is that dial for setting the yaw - is it loose?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 12 38 Mattingly:</b> No. No. Huh-uh. It just has that bias. It had it during - I guess it was the last time we were out there in the bird before flight for some test, I noticed that it had a difference in reading. I can't remember now what the occasion was, but I know that - that - that the biggest error is in the pitch channel rather than in the yaw channel.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 13 14 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we copy.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 13 20 Mattingly:</b> Do you have a procedure you'd rather have me try at acquisition to help out?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 13 37 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, if you see the signal strength oscillating a little bit, I guess the best procedure is to go to Wide and wait.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 13 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 15 45 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we are about 3 minutes from LOS. Everything is looking good. The laser has degraded a little more, but other than that, everything is okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>166 16 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll see you on the other side.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>167 07 02 Hartsfield:</b> Hello, Casper. How is it going?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 07 07 Mattingly:</b> Oh, pretty good. Got our solar corona done, and we got a little 16-millimeter strip [garble] - Unfortunately, I missed the first couple of minutes while I was changing mags, but you're pretty close to a full rev. This has turned out to be a - I was looking through the Flight Plan to see a good rev, and it looked like this one has the hatch window pointing almost straight down; it's probably the best rev we got going.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 07 40 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Did you see anything worth talking about up there before AOS?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 07 51 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. I spent all my time getting the camera set up.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 07 58 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. John and Charlie are at North Ray now, and, boy, is that a big hole.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 08 05 Mattingly:</b> Did they have any trouble getting up there? I guess not.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 08 08 Hartsfield:</b> Negative. They whizzed right on up there. Unfortunately, they are not in a position they can see the bottom, and it looks like they might have to fall in it first.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 08 21 Mattingly:</b> Well, let's not get that picture.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 08 24 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And also a surprise. They didn't see any evidence of bedding in the crater anywhere they looked.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 08 34 Mattingly:</b> I don't see any from here, either, it looks like a little slumping, but that's all.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 08 40 Hartsfield:</b> I guess those little things we saw in the photos just fooled us. It turns out that that little black spot on the east rim that was in the photo was really there. It turns out it's one huge dark-colored rock.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 08 57 Mattingly:</b> Is that right? Wonderful. They're going to chip it and get a piece out of the center, huh?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 09 04 Hartsfield:</b> Well, we wanted them to turn it over, but they decided against it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 09 22 Mattingly:</b> Did they make any comment on what the material looked like on their drive up to North Ray?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 09 29 Hartsfield:</b> Most of it appeared to be breccia; however, they did pass one that was a frothy looking thing that - we probably saw our first basalt.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 09 53 Mattingly:</b> Well, it still looks like to me that path that they drove up on is part of all that furrowed Descartes unit.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 10 38 Mattingly:</b> Hank, would you give me a call at time 39 please?</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>167 14 06 Mattingly:</b> My water spout looks like a Christmas tree ornament. It's actually very pretty. It's got a nice big bubble of water about an inch and a half in diameter sitting there on it, just looking at me. And it's just as round - it looks like the cartoons of the - the Jello that all the little mice play in.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 14 36 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 16 17 Mattingly:</b> And, Hank, I took a couple of pictures on frame ZZ; that's frame numbers 22 and 23, of that water bubble, so the folks can see what we're talking about when we say that - that gas separator has a big bubble on the end of it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 16 38 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 18 22 Mattingly:</b> Casper, the computer is yours.</p><a name="167_18_29"></a>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 18 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay, be with you - Okay, that's in Block. And do you remember the guys - I think the folks from Marshall - saying that they thought if you had bubble of water and you hit it with another bubble in zero g that one bubble ought to go through the other one?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 18 58 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 19 03 Mattingly:</b> It seems like they said something like that. I don't remember all the details, but I thought there was a good chance. I had one bubble, I'd try a second one. And I put the water gun on it. And from where I was standing, I really couldn't see all the dynamics; but it looks to me like it splashed out the back side, and the bubble was still intact on the front. Now whether it went through or had a reflection and bounced off the - the other side, I can't really tell. It did develop some air bubbles inside of the big bubble. So there may be some interesting dynamics there. </p>

        <p class="tech"><b>167 26 29 Hartsfield:</b> I called that up to you, Ken. I thought you got that. You acknowledged it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 26 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, that's another on my score, then.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 28 37 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we done passed your 39. It's 40 now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 28 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 28 45 Hartsfield:</b> Sorry about that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 28 52 Mattingly:</b> Ha, that evens the score.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 28 56 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 29 10 Mattingly:</b> That's not fair. I was really going to - I really did forget, because I was going to engage you in some verbal discourse to distract you so that you would let me forget it and I could redeem myself.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 29 25 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. I had - I had a diversion down here. We're fighting the Flight Plan.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 30 33 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, we'd like to get your Flight Plan update up to you, and would you prefer to do it after your visuals or start on it now?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 30 45 Mattingly:</b> Oh, let's see. How much time have I got? Probably I'd just as soon start now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 30 52 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, why don't we get going with it then? Okay, the first - the first change comes at 168:05.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 31 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 31 14 Hartsfield:</b> At 168:05, Mapping Camera, Off, T-stop; Verb 49 maneuver to P52 attitude; that attitude is 142, 250, 042. Mapping Camera , Standby - that should be 30 seconds, about the time you do that maneuver; Image Motion, Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 31 59 Mattingly:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 32 05 Hartsfield:</b> Laser Altimeter, Off - and that's a verify; Mapping Camera, Retract; X-Ray, Standby; Mass Spec Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiments, Standby. And there is a caution: wait 5 minutes before Retract; Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Closed; Alpha Particle X-Ray Cover, Closed; Gamma Ray, Retract; Mass Spec, Retract: enable all jets.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 33 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay, just a second and I'll read it back to you. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 34 03 Mattingly:</b> How about if I read that back to you after I pass the landing site?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 34 20 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 34 24 Mattingly:</b> Is that going to crowd us for time? You've got a better feel for it than I have.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 34 30 Hartsfield:</b> I don't think so, Ken, if we can get right on it right after the visual.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 34 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 36 55 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, John and Charlie are still at North Ray and they have found some basalt clast.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 37 08 Mattingly:</b> Very good. Around the outside or up on the rim?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 37 14 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. They are still on the rim.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 37 41 Mattingly:</b> The thing that I find most puzzling about North Ray is that the albedo comes up - and I can see - as the sun comes up the albedo change shows some, but I can see the rays around there a lot better now. And the rays lay on top of that material that seems to run, that they drove up on. Well, I take it back, it looks like there's a little tongue of that material that's probably about where they drove. It doesn't appear to be as white as the stuff just a little bit further to the east. But all that material down to the east and all the stuff that goes over - goes over to Ravine all look like the same stuff and looks very similar in character to Smoky. I see no evidence of rays in North Ray except for some blocks on the sides there, probably just slump blocks in slump patterns. And taking a quick comparison with South Ray, the - I'm not so sure South Ray is much different. Okay; I'm ready to go back to copying updates.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 39 18 Hartsfield:</b> Ah - Roger, do you want to read back what we had there for 168:05?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 39 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let's see - 168:05. Okay. I wanted to question - I had a T-stop time for the camera of 05:41, and you just gave me 05. Do you want me to stop it at that, or do you want me to go on to -</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 39 43 Hartsfield:</b> 05:41 is the correct stop time. We just - this is just putting in words what goes along about that time.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 39 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And then Verb 49 to a P52 attitude, which is 152, 250, 042.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 40 02 Hartsfield:</b> Correction on that. That's 142.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 40 04 Mattingly:</b> Mapping Camera to Standby. What did I read to you, 142, 250, 042?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 40 15 Hartsfield:</b> That's correct.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 40 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Then it's Mapping Camera to Standby. That's at 30 seconds after we get Off. Then IMC, Off; Laser Altimeter, verify Off; Mapping Camera, Retract; X-Ray to Standby; Mass Spec Ion Source, Off; Mass Spec Experiment to Standby; wait 5 minutes before retraction; then I can go ahead and close the Mapping Camera Laser Altimeter Cover; the Alpha X-Ray Door can be Closed; the Gamma Ray can be Retracted and after the 5 minutes I can retract the Mass Spec. Then I will enable a couple of thrusters.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 40 58 Hartsfield:</b> Good readback. At 168:15 H<sub>2</sub> Purge Line Heaters, On; P52-</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 41 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay 168 - wait a minute, say that again, Henry. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 41 22 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, the H<sub>2</sub> Purge Line Heaters, On at 168:15, and following that a P52 Option 3, and then an Option 1. You are going from the landing site to the burn orient. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 41 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that will be an Option 1 and then an Option 3.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 41 51 Hartsfield:</b> That will be Option 3 then Option 1.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 42 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 42 04 Hartsfield:</b> And just a reminder to use SCS for that, I guess you got that down as a standard procedure now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 42 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's a good reminder nevertheless.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 42 20 Hartsfield:</b> Well, what we are going to do here, Ken, is we're going - you're going to have to get a scratch pad now - we're - there's just no place in the Flight Plan we can do this conveniently. And we'll just give you times and things to do, and fill in the gap between 168:30 and 172:30. And if you want to do that, get your pad out. I'll read these things to you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 42 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I got a pad. Do you think we know enough to - right now that it'll pretty much sequential or do we need to leave spaces for alterations? You know, we got some of those real-time checklist sheets in the Updates book, let�s see if that is appropriate.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 43 14 Hartsfield:</b> I think that's probably a good thing to use. And Ken, I think we got a pretty good handle, too, on what should happen in sequence, so you wouldn't want to leave too many spaces. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 43 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, we got lots of these Flight Plan update sheets, so why don't I use them? And I'm ready. Let me mark this so I can always find this page. Just a second before you read it to me. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 44 21 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, we don't plan to update your platform before the burn, just the affirmation.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 44 30 Mattingly:</b> All right. Okay. I've got my paper in hand. Ready to copy.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 44 56 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Time 168:30, configure for urine dump; 168:37, P30; Verb 49 maneuver to LOPC-1 attitude.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 45 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 45 22 Hartsfield:</b> 168:40 H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge, waste water dump, and urine dump.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 45 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And you want me to dump them both at the same time, right?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 45 49 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And 168:...</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 45 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 45 55 Hartsfield:</b> ...50 terminate waste water dump at 10 percent and H<sub>2</sub> Purge Line Heaters, Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 46 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 46 22 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. They couldn't work that Mass Spec dump in there, Ken. They tried, but they couldn't. 168:55, pre-SPS SIM prep; set DET counting up to LOPC-1; secure equipment for LOPC-1 </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 47 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 47 15 Hartsfield:</b> At 169:05, P40; at 169:13, AOS and that will be those angles you have, pitch, plus 13; yaw, 258; at approximately 169:17 is LOPC-1. And we hope we'll have a good lockup, but it's only about 4 minutes, there, and we hope we'll be locked up so we can watch. At 169:20... </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 48 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 48 07 Hartsfield:</b> ...P00. Okay. And, also, I guess I should tell you, you can use the burn table for that LOPC burn. It's on page 223 of the Flight Plan. That's got all your burn rules and so on. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 48 29 Mattingly:</b> All right. Let me check that real fast.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 49 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Those look like familiar rules.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 49 12 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. And at 169:25 we'll up-link you a liftoff REFSMMAT, and at 169:30, your post-SPS-burn SIM prep, and that still leaves a gap there of about 3 hours, and that's your - after LOPC-1 we don't want to clutter up until we get through with that. But we'll go ahead and give you the rest of the things that fill in here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 49 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll still need the - plenty of time to get the cockpit squared away for rendezvous.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 49 51 Hartsfield:</b> We plan to give you lots of time for that, Ken. Do you want to read back what you got there, just to make sure we agree?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 49 59 Mattingly:</b> Yes sir. Let's see. Have we got anything coming up here that we are supposed to be watching before I read it back?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 50 05 Hartsfield:</b> I'm watching your Mapping Camera. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 50 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll read back. 168:30, configure for urine dump; 37 to P30, Verb 49, the Lunar Orbit Plane Change Number 1 attitude; at time 40, hydrogen and oxygen fuel cell purge; we turn Line Heater On back here at 168:15. Okay, at 40 we also do waste water and urine dump; at 50 terminate waste water dump at 10 percent, and turn the Purge Line Heaters Off; 55, pre-SPS SIM prep; set the DET counting up and secure equipment; at 169:05 it's P40; at 13 it's AOS, with a Pitch 13, YAW 256.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 51 22 Hartsfield:</b> That's 258.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 51 27 Mattingly:</b> At 17, it's plane change 1, 258. Okay. I got that on the other PAD, too. All right, at 17 it's plane change 1, I use the burn rules off of page 223; at 20 I'll go to P00; at 25 you give me an up-link of the ascent REFSMMAT; at 30 I'll do the post-SPS SIM prep.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 51 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And I guess there you will use your modified burn card with a 509 et cetera.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 51 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And I'll start the 509 right after my P52.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 52 04 Hartsfield:</b> 0kay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 52 15 Mattingly:</b> Then do an SCS; then I'll call 509; and then I'll take 509 down and I'll use the modified card where I start at gimbals - bring the bus ties on at 8 minutes.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 53 18 Hartsfield:</b> That's a good plan, Ken, and the - where we are going to pick up the Flight Plan again is at 168:30, to start preparing for rendezvous, and from 168:30 on to 175 hours, if you add 4 hours to all of those times, they're close enough that we can use them all the way through the rendezvous.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 53 46 Mattingly:</b> All right. That's a help.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 53 54 Hartsfield:</b> In other words, 168:30 becomes 172:30 and so on down the line all the way through, and even the lift-off time is within a minute or so. You always get an update on that anyhow, so this section of the Flight Plan will be good.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 54 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Swing. All right sir. I guess I got my work cut out.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 54 30 Hartsfield:</b> And, Casper, you are about 15 seconds from T-stop on the Mapping Camera.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 54 48 Mattingly:</b> All right. Thank you. And it's Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 55 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Our - manoeuvre is underway, Mapping Camera is coming to Standby, the IMC is Off, it's barber pole at gray, the Laser is verified Off, Mapping Camera is coming to Retract.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 56 36 Mattingly:</b> Mark.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>167 56 51 Mattingly:</b> The X-Ray is at Standby, the Mass Spec Ion Source is Off. Mass Spec Experiment is in Standby.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 00 19 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, we're showing a Retract on the Mapping Camera. Does that agree with you?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 00 25 Mattingly:</b> I'll check; just a second. Yes sir. That's about 3 minutes and 30 seconds or so.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 00 39 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 01 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Here comes the Alpha and X-Ray Door. They're closed, and Altimeter's Off, the Camera's in, so here comes the Camera and Laser Door. That must have been in; the door closed. Okay. The Gamma is coming to Retract, and I show it's been 6 minutes, so I'm gonna bring the Mass Spec to Retract, too.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 01 53 Hartsfield:</b> We concur.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 01 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Then we'll start on my P52. Got the Purge Line Heaters- On a minute early so I won't forget those. Okay, I'm in SCS control and I'm gonna call P52.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 02 28 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 04 59 Mattingly:</b> I must have one of the planets right up there above, right in that area, too. Does that sound right? That's around Nunki.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 05 11 Hartsfield:</b> Well, we'll take a look.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 05 51 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter). Okay. Back and do an Option 1 now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 05 59 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at 168:09]. The [LM] crew again [are] pointing the High Gain Antenna and we expect to get approximately 20 minutes at this location, perhaps a little bit less, we're running just a little bit behind on the timeline. While we're waiting for the communications and thetelevision to come back in we might also mention that KenMattingly, aboard the orbiting CSM Casper, is preparingto do a plane change manoeuvre to put the spacecraft inthe proper position for rendezvous and docking later withthe Lunar Module. That manoeuvre is to be performed at169 hours 17 minutes 39 seconds. It'll be on the nextrevolution and on the 49 revolution of the Moon. Themanoever will be performed with the Service PropulsionSystem engine changing the velocity 124.7 feet per second,and it will be a 7 second burn [of] that Service PropulsionSystem Engine. Sounds as if the crew is starting to getthe antenna aligned.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 10 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I have these numbers if anybody wants them.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 10 16 Hartsfield:</b> We got them.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I don't think those are worth torquing, are they?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 10 Hartsfield:</b> Negative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 18 Mattingly:</b> Yes, you have Jupiter in my field of view, and all his little moons.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 26 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 28 Mattingly:</b> He sure must be a longs ways off, because even now he's not very big. You can see his moons, though. That's about all you can tell from it - tell who he is.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 44 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken, before LOS here, after you exit that 52, we'd like to check your boom talkbacks.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Stand by, and I'll be with you. Okay. I've got -</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 12 56 Mattingly:</b> The CMC Mode on the Optics on Zero to resolve - All that's put to bed. I'm going to start the 509. I'll look at your talkbacks first. Oh, now I've got 2, I got 2 of these things that show barber pole. Both the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 13 23 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We show that both booms are not fully retracted; however, we do show them past the point where it's safe for an SPS burn. So we'd like for you now to take the Deploy-Retract switches on both of those to Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 13 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. They are safe for burns. I guess we ought to try that in sunlight.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 14 18 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We're about 3 minutes from LOS.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 14 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We - go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 14 23 Hartsfield:</b> In case we don't get comm before the burn, and at this point you're Go for the burn, the only thing you haven't done is look at your target load. You still have to enable the jets, according to the Flight Plan, and when you do your pre-SPS burn card on the SIM Bay, you'll be turning the Alpha Particle and X-Ray Off and going to Boost on the Pan Camera.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 14 53 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 15 31 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, be sure you load your DAP before you load 509.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>168 15 38 Mattingly:</b> Wilco. I was gonna try to let you take a look at the vector P40 before we got to LOS.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>169 22 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay; that's - Experiment Checklist, page X/2-3, Gegenschein pass 2. Now you gave me some step numbers; does that mean I don't do the whole pass?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 22 19 Hartsfield:</b> Well, we want the photos to start at 17:28.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 22 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay; stand by a minute. Let me get to that. </p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 22 45 Hartsfield:</b> What that's doing, Ken, is that's one of these things where you manoeuvre around to the Moulton point, to the anti-solar point, and to the - do those sequences. So Steps 1 through 4 get you through the Moulton point sequence, then you got to do a little manoeuvre to the anti-solar point.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 23 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Okay, but like I'm gonna do the whole sequence. When you read steps, I thought maybe there was something I was supposed to leave out. Okay. So all we need is another set of attitudes and some times. Now let me have this Moulton point time? It has to be done no earlier than some given time.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 23 20 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We want you to start at 170:28. 170:28.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 23 30 Mattingly:</b> I will certainly try. But that's also the earliest. Is that correct?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 23 34 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. Following that sequence, at approx - well, that time is all wrong there. But we want you to do a Verb 49 maneuver to the anti-solar point. That's about a 5-minute manoeuvre. And the attitude is 279, 223, 356.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 24 18 Mattingly:</b> Oh, boy, - Hank, if we stick a 5-minute - a maneuver as long as that in there, I'm not sure we're gonna make it. Do you know why we're changing the roll that much? Last time we didn't change roll at all. We just made a little pitch maneuver down there.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 24 33 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. FAO'll check that. But that is the same place there on the page on the checklist, the next step.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 24 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 24 47 Hartsfield:</b> They say here, if that is correct, that they want you at that attitude by 170:36, but as far as I'm concerned, you just step through the sequence.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 00 Mattingly:</b> That's the only thing I can do, Hank.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 02 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 14 Mattingly:</b> What was that target time again? 170:36?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 18 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 24 Hartsfield:</b> You won't be there by then if that - Oh, I see. FAO says what they're trying to do is combine deep-space measurements with the - with these photos.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 25 50 Hartsfield:</b> And you're not going to be at that attitude by 36. It'll be more like 38.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 26 00 Mattingly:</b> At the best; yes, sir. Now we can put in a higher rate; that's up to you folks. Is it worth the gas?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 26 13 Hartsfield:</b> You got the gas if you want to do it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 26 21 Mattingly:</b> Well, I'd like to get as much data as I can, Hank. I don't know how to assess what's - worth keeping a little RCS for rendezvous. As opposed to -</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 26 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; press ahead and use the gas. Go to a higher rate and let's get these things.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 26 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll - I'll set the - right after I get to the Moulton attitude, I'll change the DAP to the high rate.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 27 06 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, is there any question on that Gegenschein thing there, Ken?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 27 13 Mattingly:</b> I'm just looking it over. Just a second. Okay; I'm going - I'm on my way to the P52 attitude, which we're gonna get, I guess, here in daylight. That should be no problem. That's why we're gonna do a pulse torque, and I'll open the alpha/X-Ray covers and get the X-Ray on. And at time 51, I'm gonna try to do a Verb 49 to the Moulton attitude, which is 225, 233, and 358, to be there at 170:20. I'll then do those - pictures, and try to start them at 170:28. If I get in attitude, I'm gonna change the DAP to 10102. Then do a maneuver to the anti-solar point at 279, 223, and 356. And those pictures should begin at 170:36. At the conclusion of that sequence, I'll turn the DAP to 10101.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 28 27 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. That sounds good, Ken. And at 171 hours, we want to turn the X-Ray to Standby and Close the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 28 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, at 171, you want X-Ray to Standby and Close the Alpha/X-Ray Cover.</p>

        <p class="tech"><b>169 29 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 30 01 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. Following this, we want you to - this attitude'll be good, all the way up to 172:30. And we want you to get an eat period in there. And at 172:15, do a P52.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 30 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Just a second. You caught me without my book.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 31 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. Say again those events.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>169 31 18 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The attitude that you're in at the completion of the Gegenschein will be good for that time until we pick up on the - in the Flight Plan at 172:30 where we marked it up.

        <p class="tech"><b>169 51 16 Mattingly:</b> Hank, just out of curiosity, all this - minor material that's sticking up through the mare down here has that same little bench on it that I described at Riphaeus Mountains. That includes some of these circular craters that are sticking up. </p>

        <p class="tech"><b>171 23 28 Hartsfield:</b> Good readback, Ken.</p>
        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 171 hours, 36 minutes [171:24]. We're continuing to experience the noisy communications that we'd had to Orion on the lunar surface, due to the fact that we don't have the LM steerable antenna, the High Gain more directional antenna and we're using the Omnidirectional antennas on the Lunar Module. At about 173 hours [172:48] or a little bit beyond that we'll be able to cover the landing site with the 210-foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California. And we'd expect the noise on the circuit to drop somewhat at that time. While the crew on the lunar surface, Young and Duke, have been busy with their third Extra Vehicular Activity, Ken Mattingly has also been active aboard the Command Module, Casper, completed the plane change maneuver at 169 hours, 17 minutes, 39 seconds [169:05]. Flight Director Don Puddy, who's been following the CSM's activities says that the maneuver was almost precisely as planned; 124.7 feet per second change in velocity, this was a 7-second burn with the spacecraft Service Propulsion engine. And changed the plane of Casper's orbit a little over 1 and 1/3rd degrees and placing it in the proper position for rendezvous with the Lunar Module. The current CSM orbit is 65 by 55 nautical miles. For Ken Mattingly, this is a relatively quiet revolution there letting him have a break from his scientific duties, getting the Command Module cleaned up and ready to go - ready for the rendezvous and docking with Orion. And the subsequent large amount of material that will be transferred from the Lunar Module to the Command Module. The LM lift-off is currently scheduled to occur at 175 hours, 43 minutes, 30 seconds [175:31] Ground Elapsed Time. We have about 48 minutes left before we lose radio contact with Mattingly in the Command Module and he's now coming up approaching the Descartes landing site, he'll be passing over that in the next few minutes. At 171 hours, 39 minutes [171:27]; this is Apollo Control, Houston; continuing to monitor activitiesaboard Orion on the lunar surface.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>171 26 33 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. For your planning, I don't know whether it's been passed up or not, but no TV for rendezvous or docking.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>171 26 44 Mattingly:</b> Oh, okay. No, I hadn't gotten that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>171 27 03 Hartsfield:</b> The reason for that, Ken, is that the - the television interferes with the LM comm. They've been having a comm problem there with their steerable.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>171 27 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, that's one less big item to not have to unstow.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>171 30 11 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. While you're working there, I'll just read you part of a little note I got from Farouk in the backroom.

Also, concerning your comments on the site, the traverse planning troops were very happy to have them, and many of your comments were taken into consideration in planning EVAs 2 and 3.</p>

        <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 172 hours 24 minutes [172:12]. That was John Young reporting that they have a problem with dirt in connectors. He's advising us that they plan to remove their helmets sc that they can blow the dirt out of the suit connectors, and get everything fitting in tightly. At the present time Young and Duke are getting the cabin back in order, getting equipment stowed, and preparing to jettison equipment that they will not need further - such things as the Portable Life Support Systems. They'll open the hatch and deposit this unneeded equipment on the Lunar surface. That time in the Flight Plan is around 172 hours 30 minutes [172:18]. We're running a little bit behind. It'll probably come out closer to 173 hours. And at the present time Ken Mattingly aboard the CSM Casper is nearing the end of his 50th revolution of the Moon. We're just about to lose radio contact with that vehicle. It's been a quiet revolution for Mattingly. Flight Director, Don Puddy, advised that this period had been intentionally left open so that Mattingly could get the Command Module cabin in order to receive all of the rocks and other equipment from the Lunar Module, including the two passengers. And also to get everything set up for the rendezvous and docking, which will occur on the 52nd and 53rd revolutions of the Moon. As we mentioned previously we do not expect to get television of the docking. This was originally scheduled, however, it has to be dropped because of the fact the Lunar Module steerable antenna is not working. With this situation it becomes necessary for the Command Module while the two vehicles are operating separately and in close concert such as they will be during the rendezvous and docking procedures. It becomes necessary to operate the Command Module with its Omni Directional antennas, rather than with the High Gain antenna, so that we don't block the receivers at the Manned Spaceflight network station while we have one vehicle operating with a much greater signal strength than the other as we found out prior to the landing. We tend to get better saturation in the receivers in order to keep this balance proper and to avoid that sort of problem, the two vehicles will be operated in a rendezvous and docking stage using comparable signal strengths and comparable antennas. And we therefore will not be able to get the television. The signal strength will simply be too low for a good television transmission.</p><a name=172_13></a>

Dr Tony England was the Capcom also during the EVAs. And we resume will be relieved shortly, although he's still holding down those duties. And the Capcom for the Command Module is Astronaut Henry Hartsfield We're planning to have a change of shift press briefing in about 15 or 20 minutes. Best estimate is probably for about 5:00 p.m. </p><a name="172_50"></a>
