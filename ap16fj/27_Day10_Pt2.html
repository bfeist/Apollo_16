      <p class="tech"><b>218 50 03 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 50 14 Mattingly (EVA):</b> You can use the visor shade, too, when you get out. How's that?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>218 50 42 Mattingly (EVA):</b> I did. Sorry about that (laughter). Oh-no. Okay, where's the camera? Yeah, get my - I've got to get my umbilical up here first, John.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 51 07 Hartsfield:</b> Charlie, could you check and see if the Glycol mixing valve got bumped into Auto, the Temp In?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 51 15 Mattingly (EVA):</b> John, you can check that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 51 22 Young:</b> In Manual.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>218 51 48 Young:</b> There it is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 52 03 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Yeah. All right. I will when I get here. Looks like it's hung up on something there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 52 17 Hartsfield:</b> 16, if you'll take the Temp In switch to Auto, please.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 52 28 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 52 38 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, back to Manual on the Temp In.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 52 44 Mattingly (EVA):</b> I need some more cable there, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 52 57 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Yep.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>218 53 14 Young:</b> Yeah, that's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 53 25 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Charlie, I'm going to have to back in here so I can get a little better grip. I've got to turn the pole around. Get my foot on something. Okay, thank you. See now - let me see if I can -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 53 46 Duke:</b> That's it. Panel 16 [sic] Power, On.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 54 02 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Yeah, I can feel it. How's the - how's the photos of the SIM bay? Does it - do I need to adjust it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 54 11 Hartsfield:</b> Looks pretty good down here, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 54 12 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Houston, is that picture okay? All right, I'm going back to the SIM bay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 54 24 Mattingly (EVA):</b> It - it really is ripe.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 54 41 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 54 56 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Are you ready, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 55 01 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Yeah, on your egress, you sure will.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 55 10 Mattingly (EVA):</b> All set?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 55 17 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 55 20 Hartsfield:</b> Charlie, can you verify the TV pole's aligned?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 55 24 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, I'd say the service module is pretty well blistered. Did the picture shift? Are you not getting a good picture, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 55 38 Hartsfield:</b> It looks like it might be swung - swung a little too far to the left. We're not sure. That would be to Charlie's left.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 55 45 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, I'll fix that in a minute. All right. Okay. Stand by. No, we can't put it there without moving the door. Let's get this done. Number 1, I'm at the Mapping Camera, and the Stellar cover door is open, and the Stellar cover is jammed out, and jammed against the handrail. Copy, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 56 13 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 56 17 Mattingly (EVA):</b> I am.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 56 29 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 56 59 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Oh, man. Man, the old Moon's out there. Okay, going after the Pan Camera. Okay, here comes the hard cover ... gone.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Ken Mattingly will first receive - retrieve the Pan Camera cassette -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 57 32 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Soft cover has gone. Okay, I'm going after the hook.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> He will return this to the hatch, and Lunar Module pilot, Charlie Duke, will attach a tether ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 57 43 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 58 00 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Boy, that old visor of yours - that outer visor on the glare shield really comes in handy. Okay.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Duke will attach a tether, a large hook to the cassette and lock.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 58 23 Mattingly (EVA):</b> The pip pin is out, and I'm throwing it away.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> He will now squeeze the handle and remove the cassette.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 58 35 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Oh, they'll open, not much I bet. Not at all, there it is, it's out.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Mattingly reports he's got the cassette. The Pan Camera cassette weighs 72 pounds in one g. It'll now be returned or transferred to the hatch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 59 11 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, get my feet out. There's one. There's two.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> He was taking his feet out from the restraint.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 59 28 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> You now see the cassette being returned to Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 59 40 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, the TV is just right. It doesn't need adjustment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 59 49 Mattingly (EVA):</b> All right.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> The cassette will be stowed on the Lunar Module Pilot's couch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 00 33 Mattingly (EVA):</b> It is that, all right. I don't even see any stars.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 01 10 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, Charlie, will you hook that back to my ring?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 01 24 Mattingly (EVA):</b> You don't need to lock it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 01 28 Duke:</b> Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 01 30 Mattingly (EVA):</b> All right, going back for the mapper.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Ken Mattingly now returning for the map camera cassette.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 01 47 Mattingly (EVA):</b> No, the mapper is still out here, I betcha.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 01 54 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Oh, man!</p><a name="219_02_10"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 02 10 Mattingly (EVA):</b> All righty. I got my feet well locked, and I got a good suit pressure, and cooling is just fine, and let me tell you a few things about the old SIM bay. Okay. The first thing that's real obvious to you out here is the - is the amount of bubbling on the service module paint. It's more - it's a bit more than I anticipated seeing and the radiator panel down to the right side of the SIM bay looks nice and clean. There's no bubbles on the paint or anything like that. The area right under the quad - I'll have to raise my visor to see - Yeah, I got the inner one still down. I will. Yeah, you don't need to remind me of that one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 03 13 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, the area directly under the quad doesn't look to me like it's blistered any more than the areas everywhere else around here. That's just a qualitative comment. The - in fact, the paint on the quad itself is as blistered. The area directly under the nozzle on the - the plus-Z jet on Quad B is all blistered. I can see that in the Sun. I can't tell about the other surfaces. Okay, looking now at the mapping - at the Mass Spec and the Gamma Ray, I'm going to have to move aft to do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 03 51 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, I'd like to caution you on the Mass Spec to steer clear of that door there. It's very soft and it could bend and break and leave a jagged edge.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 04 01 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Roger. I won't touch it.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Ken Mattingly providing a narrative of what he's seen during his rest period prior to retrieving the Mapping Camera cassette...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 04 10 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 04 17 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Sorry about that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 04 33 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, I've got a good handhold over here on the Pan Camera - this rail, so that's a good one, and now I'm over the Gamma Ray door and it's about open at, say, 30 degrees.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 04 58 Mattingly (EVA):</b> And I can't - I can nudge it, and it looks like it's hitting on the top of the Gamma Ray spectrometer itself. No, it isn't. It's not touching the Spectrometer. And I'm not real sure what it is jammed on. I can't see anything anywhere. The cover just feels like it's a little bit loose at about a 30-degree jiggle, and I can't see the mechanism to tell whether it's broken. The ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 05 32 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; can you see if the guide rails come through the SIM?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 05 34 Mattingly (EVA):</b> ... Mapping Camera - Oh, let me take a look; I don't think I can get my head over there far enough to tell that. Yes, they do. They come right up to the pointed edge.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 05 49 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 05 52 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, and on the Mass Spec, there's nothing there but the door wide open. Was there something in particular you'd like me to look at back here - on the Mass Spec?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 06 03 Hartsfield:</b> Negative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 06 06 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, anything else on the aft end? I don't see any blistering of paint or anything. It's all clean in the aft shell.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 06 17 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Copy.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Two hundred and 43 hours, 52 minutes [219:05] Ground Elapsed Time. Sixteen now at a distance of 173,406 nautical miles.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 06 32 Mattingly (EVA):</b> All right; thank you, Charlie. Now, I'll put my feet in here, and we'll take a look at the old mapper. Okay, while I'm standing on top of the DAC camera, the V-over-H sensor looks perfectly clean. There's nothing on the sensor. I see no evidence of contamination on the sensor, either the - the light meter or the V over H. The barrel is clean, all the decks and surfaces of the Pan Camera installation are clean.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 07 13 Hartsfield:</b> Very good, Ken.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Ken Mattingly now securing himself with his foot restraints. Preparing to retrieve the Mapping Camera cassette. The -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 07 28 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, here comes the Mapping Camera cover - hard cover. The soft cover. Okay, that'll be next. Yeah, that's my wrist tether.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> The Mapping Camera cassette weighs 20 pounds in one g, it will be passed along in much the same way as the Pan Camera was, attached to a...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 07 55 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 08 12 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Ready?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 08 26 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Okay, I'm putting the tether on now, John.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> ...attached to the Commanders tether large hook, to the cassette, it's locked and then stored what's returned to the cabin.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>219 09 05 Mattingly (EVA):</b> Oh, I'm having trouble with this hook. I - If I can get it on, I can get it locked.</p>

It appears to us that something is venting in there. I'd like to tell you - Before we started the Bat B Charger, 3 or 4 hours ago - whenever it was. We failed to check it before we started. And when we started the charge, there was a slight odor that's hard to identify, but it smelled like insulation. Then we stopped the charge, reconfigured again - Mainly I stopped the charge because I was looking at the wrong thing. I was looking at Bat Bus B and I saw the currents go negative which is nominal, but - so I stopped the charge and went back to Bat B Charge, and it looked okay. And there was no odor. And then we looked at the Systems Test and we had 3 - 3 volts. We been venting it now on y'all's request. And we'd vent it to 1, and then it immediately starts climbing back to 01.45, and then it slowly increases and usually stabilizes out at about 2 or so. Over.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>221 57 13 Peterson:</b> 16, we've got a update to the G&amp;C Checklist on the PIPA bias changes, and also we're gonna play a little game with the mixing valve to try to reset it for the Trans-Earth coast. We can do that whenever you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>221 57 32 Duke:</b> Okay; do - we have something to copy for the PIPA bias?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>221 57 36 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. It's in the G&amp;C Checklist, page 9-4.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>221 57 44 Duke:</b> Okay; could you hold off on that? And we're sort of cluttered here now, and we - give me the mixing valve. Is that procedure down on below the couches or just up on the cockpit?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>221 57 57 Peterson:</b> We can do this all from up in the cockpit. What we're gonna do - and I don't want you to do it now - but what we're gonna do is put it in Auto, and EECOM will sit here and watch the flow-rate change, and when we a - get to a certain lead point on what we think is the desired flow rate, he'll cue me, and I'll cue you, and we'll go to Manual.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>221 58 21 Duke:</b> Okay; we're ready at your - Give me a mark.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>221 58 26 Peterson:</b> Okay; stand by. Okay; go to Auto, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>221 58 39 Duke:</b> Mark. Auto.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 02 45 Peterson:</b> Okay; Charlie, the - the valve didn't act the way we thought it was going to. It's been oscillating down and back up on the flow rate, and we were gonna try to catch it in midcycle. And this time, when we went to Auto, it just went up pretty high and it's oscillating a little, but it's staying high. We're gonna watch it for a couple or 3 more minutes, and if it doesn't work, we'll probably have to go down below the couch here and play with the manual valve.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 03 12 Duke:</b> Okay. That'll be the trick of the week in our present configuration.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 03 19 Peterson:</b> Well, we can wait awhile for that.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; at 246 hours, 50 minutes [222:03]. The procedure that we have Charlie Duke, involved in at the moment is attempting to get the proper setting on the mixing valve. This is the valve that controls the amount of the cold water coming back from the radiators - cold water/glycol - that is mixed with the warm water/glycol that has been circulated through the electrical equipment in the cabin, and it's picked up heat from various sources in the spacecraft. By mixing the amount of cold water that is allowed to flow in with the warm water, you're able to maintain the proper cabin temperature. Since very early in the mission it has been known that the mixing valve, which functions in much the same manner as a thermostatically controlled heater valve, has been oscillating more frequently that it would normally oscillate. It has been allowing the flow to increase and then shutting it down and increase and shutting down more rapidly. To get around this we've been having the crew set the level manually at what we think is the proper level for the cabin conditions that are existing at the time. The situation at the moment is that we're attempting to have them reset for changing conditions of the spacecraft to take care of the situation that we now have with the thermal loads and the metabolic heat given off by three crewmen and the situation as we have in this trans-Earth leg of the flight. To do this we had hoped to have the EECOM here in the control center watching the telemetry data. The procedure is to have the crew, in this case Charlie Duke, switch the valve from the manual setting to the automatic setting and watch it cycle. And as it cycled and reached the desired level, Duke would then switch it to manual and it would hold at that point. The problem initially was that the valve was not cycling in auto as we had seen it but it, at last report from EECOM, had started down. And when it reaches the proper level, Charlie Duke will be given the cue to switch to manual and the mixing valve should then hold at that level. And we would hope that that would be a suitable level for the spacecraft during this trans-Earth coast. Apollo 16 at the moment is 166,331 nautical miles from Earth. And the spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 4,094 feet per second.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>222 10 39 Peterson:</b> Charlie, on that noise that you're hearing, is - are John and Ken also hearing the same thing?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 10 47 Duke:</b> Yeah, what it is, is John has his comm carrier off but connected, and it - in his PGA, one of the mikes was down in the neck ring, and the - the vent tube was blowing on it. It's okay. It's up here. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 11 02 Peterson:</b> Okay; we understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 11 04 Duke:</b> It sounded exactly like radio - it sounded exactly like the radio static, though.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 11 09 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apparently the situation on the noise that Charlie Duke mentioned - initially reported, was not on the uplink but as you heard him say, an unused microphone in one of the suits. I believe he said in John Young's suit was in a position where it was picking up air flow. Presumably through the suit loop and was in fact putting a noise on their communications loop in the spacecraft that sounded much like wind blowing, which in fact it was.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 11 45 Duke:</b> Pete, we've still got quite a bit of stowage left. If you could keep us advised on the Flight Plan, we'd appreciate it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>222 11 53 Peterson:</b> Okay. Will do.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Again to reiterate on the procedure that we had Charlie Duke going through to get the mixing valve set at the proper flow rate to keep the cabin temperature adjusted properly. And apparently that procedure worked. Now, what it required was that the mixing valve, in effect, malfunctioned as we have seen it doing in the automatic position where it is cycling rather than holding at a constant level. When we first tried to go through the procedure, the mixing valve refused to cycle in the automatic position, but instead held steady the way it should. However, knowing that this could be a temporary condition [and] that it would again begin cycling at some point, it was still necessary to get it set in the proper position manually. Having Duke cycle the switch from automatic to manual, and back to automatic again. Apparently [this] had the desired effect, and immediately after he did this, the EECOM reported the flow rate again cycling in automatic, and as it dropped through 242 pounds per hour flow rate, we gave the call to Charlie Duke to switch it to manual at that point, at which point it would hold that level in the manual position by the time the message got past from EECOM to Capcom and up to Charlie Duke in the spacecraft, and the switch thrown, the flow rate had gone below 242 to 236, but we consider that to be an adequate flow rate to maintain the kind of cooling that would be desirable at this point in the flight. And from the crew description, they apparently still have some stowing to go through following that EVA. Apparently the suits are not yet stowed, and they'll be doing that prior to their eat and sleep period. Also, at the present time they have the spacecraft SIM bay pointed toward one of the galactic sources of X-rays, using the X-ray fluorescence spectrometry experiment, in an attempt to get some signatures from these various X-ray sources in other galaxies.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; at 247 hours, 50 minutes [222:03]. It's been a rather quiet crew for the past 30 or 40 minutes aboard Apollo 16. At the present time they have the spacecraft Scientific Instrument Module bay pointed toward one of the X-ray sources in deep space. And the Principal Investigator for the X-ray fluorescent spectrometry experiment reports that we are getting good counting data on the X-ray source. Later this evening the crew will be aligning the guidance system platform which is used as a stable reference for attitude determination. They also are scheduled to change out one of the lithium hydroxide canisters which removes carbon dioxide from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. A little while ago we had Charlie Duke set the mixing valve which controls the cabin temperature manually in the proper position. And that appears to be doing its job properly at the moment. The crew is scheduled to begin a rest period at 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43], or approximately 11:30 Houston time. And around 12:30 Houston time, INCO - the Instrumentation and Communications Officer here in the Control Center - plans once again to turn on the television camera aboard the Lunar Rover at the Descartes landing site and we'll operate that for about 15 minutes. We'll be receiving the television through the 210-foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California. And again, we'll be pointing the camera by remote control from the Control Center at various rocks and hills around the landing site allowing geologists to get a second look, in this case a third look at these features. The camera was activated last night, and we took a similar pan of the landing site looking at rocks, interesting rocks and interesting features and that will be done again this evening actually early tomorrow morning for about 15 minutes. In the Control Center we now have a clock counting down to entry. That event will occur will occur at 42 hours, 31 minutes from now, with Apollo 16 re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The spacecraft, at this time, is 163,952 nautical miles from Earth and we're watching the velocity increase gradually, and that will be a continuing thing that we will be seeing and as we get closer to entry. The velocity that now is reading about 4,100 feet per second will be up in excess of 36,000 feet per second.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. Our Flight Plan time is now 248 hours, 54 minutes [224:07], and aboard Apollo 16, the crew is keeping the spacecraft Scientific Instrument Module bay pointed at a galactic target known as Sco X-1. This is a galactic X-ray hot spot source of unusually high X-ray emission, and in order to maintain the proper thermal equilibrium within the spacecraft, actually on the spacecraft surface and for the various equipment located beneath the surface of the CSM, the crew is rotating in such a way that they will change the way the Sun is shining on the vehicle, but at the same time maintain the proper orientation within the SIM Bay so that the alpha - rather the X-ray Spectrometry experiment maintains its proper pointing attitude. As they're going through this maneuver, we're having momentary drop outs in communication, but expect that they will have the High Gain antenna locked up again. In fact, we do now have apparent solid lock-on. In about an hour, the crew will be again aligning the platform of the spacecraft, the stable platform used as an attitude reference. They are then scheduled to have an eat period. They'll be changing out one of the lithium hydroxide canisters; and at about 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43]; beginning an eight-hour rest period. And that will be at, a little after 11:30 Houston time. We presently show Apollo 16 some 161,300 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4,186 feet per second. And the spacecraft has just maneuvered out of antenna lock-on so that we're getting, again, the noise on the communication circuit. And we would expect that to clear up momentarily. Our clock counting down to Entry Interface, the point at which Apollo 16 will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, shows that we're now 41 hours, 27 minutes away from that event.</p>

      <p class="ed">[Break in CM transcript until 227:20:10.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 30 33 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. We need to go extend - or Deploy on the Gamma Ray for 26 seconds.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 30 49 Young:</b> Okay; that's in work.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 30 53 Peterson:</b> Roger; and we do not want to retract it first; just extend it for 26 seconds from your present position.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 31 03 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 35 36 Peterson:</b> And, 16, we've got some national and local news here for you while you're finishing up with your chores there. The - first of all, Ken Mattingly made the headlines today in connection with the EVA, and we got a big cartoon here showing the Apollo 16 Intercelestial Hauling Company coming back from the Moon with a big load of rocks. Looks like they've made a - a railroad car out of a SIM bay here and got a big pile of rocks on it there. Moon in the background, and all that sort of thing. Got a couple of things here, one from Vietnam. Communist tanks drove retreating South Vietnamese soldiers toward the provincial capital of Kontum in the Central Highlands today, forcing Government troops to abandon two more artillery bases in the town of Dac To. Seven bases in the Central Highlands have fallen to the Communists since Sunday. Ten waves of B-52s bombed Communist troop positions during the night in an effort to stop the offensive that appeared aimed at Kontum. And from Northern Ireland, some guy found a new use for a baby carriage. He packed it with gelignite, which one of our backroom guys here tells me is a - an explosive, and bombed Northern Ireland's main telephone exchange during the night in a major attempt to disrupt the province's communications. The carriage exploded in a sheet of flames shortly before midnight Monday outside the Belfast Telephone Exchange, injuring two British soldiers and a civilian, and toppling part of the wall of the seven-story brown brick building. And the Astros amazed everybody, I guess, by winning a - their seventh straight today. Chicago's Ron Santo and Houston's Lee May bashed two-run homers for each side in the first inning, and then the two teams battled tenaciously without another score until John Edwards smashed an 11th inning home run that gave the Houston team a 3-to-2 victory. That makes it seven in a row for the Astros, and brought them a first-place tie with Los Angeles in the National League West, and gave them the best nine-game start, that's seven wins and two losses, in the team's 10-year history.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 38 02 Young:</b> Go get them, Astros.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 38 06 Peterson:</b> Okay; got another little thing here in the local paper you might be interested in. Houston paper reports that the city is moving to annex a 50-square-mile area west of Houston, including the Federally-owned Addicks and Barker Reservoirs and the land between them and the present city limits. The annexation reportedly would open the way for the city to develop the reservoir areas for recreational purposes. And I guess that does not - the annexation would not include about 4 square miles of Barker Reservoir in Fort Bend County, which is outside the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. And three US Representatives have studied a feasibility study of deepwater ports in the Gulf of Mexico and have recommended the Texas Coast as a possible site. Texas Representatives Jack Brooks of Beaumont, Bob Eekhardt of Houston, and John Young of Corpus Christi appeared here Monday at a US Corps of Engineer public hearing to voice their opinions on such a facility.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 39 37 Peterson:</b> Okay; the weather here is real nice. Houston and vicinity was fair all day and tonight. Becoming partly cloudy Wednesday. Warm afternoons, cool again tonight the paper says. High today was in the upper-80s, low tonight in the upper-50s, and high Wednesday in the mid-80s. And dry, cool air prevailing over most of the US. And of more immediate interest, the weather in the recovery area is excellent and forecast to stay that way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 40 16 Duke:</b> That's the best news we've heard in a long time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 40 21 Peterson:</b> And we got one final item here I thought you might find interesting. The Memphis Better Business Bureau couldn't help the man who complained that a car dealer refused to refund his $50 downpayment after he decided not to buy the car. Apparently he hadn't told the Better Business Bureau all the facts, because it turns out the dealer suggested he take the car for a test ride and he did, but he was gone three days and put 1,500 miles on the car.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 40 50 Young:</b> (Laughter) Beautiful.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 40 56 Duke:</b> And then he didn't want to buy it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 41 00 Peterson:</b> He didn't want to buy it, and he wanted his money back, his $50 downpayment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 41 05 Duke:</b> (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 41 17 Peterson:</b> You can probably find a lot of flaws with that kind of test procedure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 41 22 Duke:</b> Yeah, sure could.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 41 33 Young:</b> How did the TV look down there with Ken outside? I was watching it on the monitor. It seemed like - in places it was too bright, and other places, not bright enough. And I guess that's the way the - I guess that's - unfortunately, that's the way the sunlight is up here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 41 50 Peterson:</b> Yeah, I guess we agree with that, but the pictures were overall real good, John. They looked - looked real good to us. You could see a lot of the detail, and I don't think we missed very much. There were some - some dark areas.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 42 06 Young:</b> Okay; fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 42 09 Mattingly:</b> I'll tell you, the darkest area, Pete, is looking away from that Sun. Boy, is it black out there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 42 14 Peterson:</b> I bet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 42 17 Young:</b> That's time number 47.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 42 50 Young:</b> I know you guys won't believe this, but after spending 3 days among the rocks, ever so often, when we're sitting around in here, we see a pebble go by. And that's the truth. I don't know what we're gonna do with them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 43 06 Peterson:</b> Just a pebble, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 43 07 Young:</b> They just seem to - I guess they'll all get collected in ECS. Yeah. When we came back in our suits, it - it got in. I guess we pretty well tracked a lot of dirt into the LM unavoidably, and we weren't able to clean it up. So when we docked, we tried to keep it all in the Lunar Module, but it - this - the inflow valve over here was the only thing that was really working once we got powered down. And then when we went back in there and powered up everything, we took the Command Module hose over with us and that circulated the air. And I think we ended up with quite a few unexpected little pieces of Moon rock in the Command Module.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 43 47 Peterson:</b> Roger, understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 43 50 Young:</b> And every time - and every time Charlie sees one float by, he picks it up and changes his story.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 43 57 Peterson:</b> He's still analyzing them, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 44 01 Young:</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 44 02 Duke:</b> I got it all straight now though, Pete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 44 04 Peterson:</b> Good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 44 10 Duke:</b> I will be unswayed by the facts when we get back.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 44 15 Peterson:</b> Roger, understand. And would you give us Gamma Ray, Shield on, now, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 44 21 Duke:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 46 02 Mattingly:</b> I tell you, Pete, looking away from - on that EVA, looking away in it out into that blackness, you get the distinct impression that you don't want to let go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 46 14 Peterson:</b> Yeah, I - I can believe that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 46 24 Peterson:</b> Even on TV it looks pretty dark out there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 46 31 Young:</b> I - I guess - we're sitting around talking about it here when we had a few slack moments, and one of the things we think is that no matter what you see on the pictures, or what you see on the TV, or what you'll see when we get back with these pictures, you just don't have a feeling of about how stark and brilliant these colors are. Like Descartes was the most dazzling place I believe I've ever been. It just absolutely - brilliant colors that contrast in that bright Sun, and the same way for this EVA that Ken and Charlie just finished. Why it - looking out that hatch it - the black that you can take with a camera is not gonna show up the way that that black actually was.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 50 03 Peterson:</b> 16, we've got about three more small items. We've got an update to the G&amp;C Checklist, one change to the Flight Plan at 251:45 [226:58], and we need to get John's PRD reading.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 50 26 Young:</b> Okay; well, I just packed the thing away in the suit locker. If you want me to dig it out, I'll get it, but it's gonna be a job.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 50 34 Peterson:</b> Stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 50 36 Young:</b> I'm sorry about that, but that thing is just hard to get a hold of and keep a hold of.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 51 00 Peterson:</b> Okay; John, I guess we'll try to get to it sometime tomorrow, maybe.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 51 12 Young:</b> Well, in other words, you tell me that you want me to go in there and dig that thing out, and I don't mind doing it if it's got to be done, but I mean - I can't see I'm getting anymore PRDs than the other two guys.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 51 35 Peterson:</b> Stand by, John. We - we're having a little discussion here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 51 45 Mattingly:</b> He's been within a couple of counts of me, Pete, during the whole flight.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 51 52 Peterson:</b> Roger. While we're waiting, you want to go ahead and get this change in the Flight Plan at 251:45?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 52 02 Mattingly:</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 52 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 52 30 Peterson:</b> Okay. At 251:45 [226:58] where it says "Gamma Ray, Retract and then Deploy," we want to strike out the part that says "Retract," and also we want to change the "45 seconds" to "12 seconds." What we're gonna do is just bring it back in from its present position. And we want to make that a "Retract" instead of a "Deploy."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 52 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay; that's a Retract to 16 feet, and that's 12 seconds from the existing position.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 52 57 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. And also I've got this update on Page G9-4, G&amp;N [sic] Checklist.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 53 12 Young:</b> Okay, I'll have to - I'm gonna have to unstow that thing to see where we put it.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>224 53 39 Young:</b> Okay; we've got a - a Flight Plan update that starts at 249 hours and 39 minutes [224:52]. It's called "Crew Eat Period."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 53 49 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 53 53 Young:</b> Just thought we ought to be able to make some real-time changes from up here too.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 53 57 Peterson:</b> Roger. That sounds reasonable. I think we've done our share in the last couple of days.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 54 03 Young:</b> Yes, I'm sure you'll - you have earned the medals you will receive.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 54 12 Peterson:</b> That sounds tragic.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 52 14 Young:</b> (Laughter) Okay. How about - I got G9-4 here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>224 54 23 Peterson:</b> Okay. We want to change in column A, line 5 should now read 03753, and line 7 should read ...</p>

A short while ago - that was Ken Mattingly who gave us a Flight Plan update, obviously in retaliation for the hundreds of Flight Plan updates that Mission Control has passed up to the crew since they got behind in the Flight Plan.

      <p class="tech"><b>224 57 29 Peterson:</b> 16, the decision has been made. We'll leave the suits stowed, and we won't worry about the PRD. And, also, we'd like to advise you that we're now back on the Flight Plan at 250 hours.</p>

      <p class="ed">[No comm for 19 minutes.]</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 250 hours [225:13]. The crew aboard Apollo 16 now apparently getting caught up with their eating. After what they described as a rather involved job of getting piles of material stowed - a job which John Young said they still haven't completed - but they're looking for places to get everything tucked away neatly prior to entry which is now some 40 hours, 23 minutes away. And we also have a clock counting down to the time of splashdown which would be 40 hours, 36 minutes from now. And about 2&frac12; hours from the present time; or at about 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43]; we expect to say goodnight to the crew and get them bedded down for an 8-hour rest period. As they have begun to make headway in getting things stowed away and getting the cabin ship shape again, we find them much more talkative. During the past hour we've gotten a rather picturesque description from all three crewman. They would appear to be in obvious good spirits. You heard a conversation between CapCom Don Peterson and John Young in reference to the PRD, or Personal Radiation Dosimeter. These are radiation meters carried in the suits of each of the crewman measuring their exposure to radiation and Young reported that he had stowed his suit with the radiation dosimeter packed away in the suit because of the problem in getting this instrument out. The fact that his dosimeter had been reading very closely to the readings that we were also getting on Charlie Duke's coupled with the fact that none of the levels have been anything for concern, we've given Young a go ahead to leave the dosimeter stowed where it is. We'll have no further requirement to get a radiation dosimeter reading on him. At the present time, Apollo 16 is 158,668 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is up now to 4,239 feet per second and that just updated to 4,240. At the time of entry, the velocity will reach some 36,196 feet per second. And we're currently showing Entry Interface angle - the angle at which the spacecraft enters the Earth's atmosphere - to be minus 6.6 degrees. The mid-course correction performed at Mid-Course-Correction-5 opportunity earlier in the day brought that flight path angle from something in excess of 7&frac12; degrees down to 6.6, which is getting close to the desired 6.5. And we do have a mid-course correction opportunity, the so-called Mid-Course-Correction-7, which comes shortly before Entry Interface. And at that time, would expect a small correction again to bring the flight path angle down to the desired 6.5 [degrees]. The time of entry is determined by the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. From that point on, the mid-course corrections are targeted to control the Entry Interface angle. This is the angle measured below [the] horizontal and describes the amount of the angle at which the spacecraft is digging into Earth's atmosphere. Any negative number has it entering, a positive number would show that the spacecraft was coming in such a way that it would not re-enter. This Entry Interface angle is set so that the spacecraft comes in at about 6.5 degrees below horizontal. This gives the proper balance between an entry that does not produce excessive g-forces, and one that bites in sharply enough to Earth's atmosphere to assure capture. And that again, that nominal Entry Interface angle is 6.5 degrees. We're currently showing 6.6 which is very close to that desired. About the only activities that we now show on the Flight Plan prior to putting the crew to sleep, are to do a platform alignment, aligning the guidance platform which is used as an attitude reference. We have an activity called contamination control, which primarily involves removing the screens from the environmental control system and cleaning them off. You heard John Young report that there's a fair amount of dirt and debris which is almost inevitable from the amount of dirt brought back on their suits from the lunar surface. And we routinely, during the trans-Earth coast, perform a number of these contamination control operations to minimize the amount of dirt collecting on the screens - the filtration screens of the Environmental Control System. They also will be changing out one of the lithium hydroxide canisters that absorbs carbon dioxide, keeps the anount of carbon dioxide in the cabin atmosphere at acceptable levels. And up through 251 hours, 30 minutes [226:43], the crew is scheduled to have the X-ray fluorescence experiment in the Scientific Instrument Module bay pointed at Sco X-1, the galactic source of X-rays which allows the Principal Investigator to get a calibration, so-called signature, of the X-ray energy admitted by this galactic source.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>225 27 54 Duke:</b> Roger. Pete - Pete, we're wondering if you could get FAO working and - on the Mars attitude sequence and see if he could come up with one that - during our normal Flight Plan where we got some Sun in the windows, so we could get some interior photography?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 28 13 Peterson:</b> Stand by. We'll take a look at it. Okay; FAO says he thinks he can ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 28 20 Duke:</b> I'd appreciate it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 28 22 Peterson:</b> FAO says he thinks he can work that in, and also we need to remind you, I guess, that we need a P52 before you go to bed tonight.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 28 31 Duke:</b> Roger. Just as - soon as John gets out of the kitchen, Ken's gonna give you one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 28 37 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 34 35 Young:</b> We're just looking at the Flight Plan here, and we just finished Day 10, Meal B, and 10 minutes from now, we got to start on Day 10, Meal C.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>225 35 18 Duke:</b> If Alex - Pete, if Alexander the Great had had this kind of chow, he could feed his whole army for two days on what we eat in one meal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 54 02 Peterson:</b> 16, we've got the torquing angles. You can go ahead and torque them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>225 54 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 06 55 Duke:</b> Hey, Pete. Will Tony be on before we go to sleep? He said he had some geology questions for us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 07 06 Peterson:</b> Doesn't look like it now. He's scheduled to be here in a couple of hours. Or maybe he might come in a little sooner than that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 07 14 Duke:</b> Thank you.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 251 hours [226:13]. Flight Director Don Puddy has just recently completed going around the room checking with all of his Flight Controllers to see if everything appears in good order to put the crew to bed. We plan to do that in about an hour and a half at a Flight Plan time of 252 hours, 30 minutes [227:43]. And everything appears to be in good order at this point. The crew is presently completing the Program 52 guidance platform alignment. That will pretty much complete the Flight Plan activities prior to the sleep period. One or two minor activites that they will need to complete, such as changing the lithium hydroxide canister, but they have completed eating and are in pretty good shape to begin their sleep period on schedule. One of the activities that they will be doing prior to beginning the rest period is setting the spacecraft up in the Passive Thermal Control mode. They'll be doing this in a slightly different manner than previously. Normally, the spacecraft is set up with the longitudinal axis at right angles to the Earth-Moon plane. Tonight when they set it up in Passive Thermal Control, the crew will be pitching the spacecraft back slightly from their normal right-angle attitude. This is to allow the instruments in the Scientific Instrument Module bay to continue pointing at the desired targets and still to keep the spacecraft rotating to maintain the proper thermal control. But every rotation it will come up on the proper target. The Command Module Pilot, Ken Mattingly will be wearing the biomedical harness tonight. He'll be the crewman that the flight surgeon will be monitoring heart rate on. That had in the Flight Plan scheduled to - the Flight Plan had scheduled Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke to be wearing the biomedical harness during the sleep period. However, as you heard Duke's biomedical data was erratic and we are getting heart rate on him, but it's not consistant and it's not good solid data.</p><a name="226_17_14"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 17 14 Peterson:</b> And, 16; Houston. I've got about five items for you here that'll wind it up for the night, I think. First of all, I'll start out talking about this battery compartment. We've looked at it now, over quite a period of time, and we feel that the pressure rise is due to a very tight cabin battery compartment that prevents any leakage from the compartment to the cabin. And also to the increased battery venting. Now, the - the increased battery venting resulted from recharging the batteries longer than normal. And that in turn resulted from the high discharges during LOI and DOI burns. We really don't feel there's anything wrong with the batteries. In fact, right now, we're looking at a requirement from now until the end of the mission of about 30 amp-hours. And we've got about 100 amp-hours in the batteries right now. We'll continue to check the battery compartment pressure, but we really don't expect to have to vent the compartment or to perform any additional battery charging prior to entry. We'd like to get one more read-out prior to your going to sleep. We'll periodically check tomorrow, but in summary, we feel that there's really not a problem. And the odor that you mentioned is - is probably not from the battery compartment, but is more characteristic of the battery charger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 18 42 Young:</b> Okay, Pete. Thank you very much. It makes me feel better to - I was just a little gitchy about recharging, especially Bat B, since - that's where we first experienced that odor. We had not done that previously, and that makes that sound like a pretty good story. And we haven't been monitoring that compartment on the systems test meter very much, so we really can't give you a history of it. But that sounds pretty good to - to me. Thank you. What else?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 19 17 Peterson:</b> Okay. We do want to monitor the CMP on the biomed, and I guess we're still showing that you're on the - on the - on the biomed monitoring system right now. Also, your equipment ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 19 32 Young:</b> That's right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 19 39 Peterson:</b> Also, Charlie, your e ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 19 41 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 19 42 Peterson:</b> ... your equipment is apparently still not functioning properly. So we'll need new - a new biomed harness on you, probably for tomorrow night. We need to get that on sometime tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 19 56 Duke:</b> Okay, fine. I'll be glad to do that. What - what appears to be wrong with the signal?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 20 02 Peterson:</b> Stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 20 15 Peterson:</b> They - they think it's the sensors are probably loose again with maybe some drying of the electrolyte under the sensors, but rather than try to troubleshoot that, they figure it's better just to go to a new harness.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 20 29 Duke:</b> Okay, will do. I just put these on this morning, new, but we'll - we'll - we'll swap out in the morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 20 43 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Don, what film magazines do we have allocated for our little - little - F-equals-MA experiment?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 20 55 Peterson:</b> Hang on just a minute. I'll get it for you. Let me give you one more item here while I'm - then I'll get that for you. All right. We'd like to - Right after we go into PTC and get onto the Omnis, we'd like to put the Telcom Group 2 to AC2. The reason for doing that is we just want to return the spacecraft to a nominal configuration because that's the way all our doc - documents and onboard checklists and so on are written.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 21 28 Duke:</b> All right, we'll do that. When we spin up - go on the Omnis - we'll go to Group 2 to AC2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 21 34 Peterson:</b> Roger; thank you. And also, we'd like to get an OPS read-out sometime prior to your going to sleep tonight.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 21 48 Duke:</b> Okay. We gave you one earlier, and it's stowed in A-8 now. And it was 1300 at that time. You want another one?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 21 59 Peterson:</b> Roger. I guess we'd like to get one more, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 22 03 Young:</b> That was plenty of time after it had - it was probably at least an hour and a half after it'd had a chance to - to equalize after the blowdown.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 22 14 Peterson:</b> Roger. Okay, 16; if it's not readily accessible, that's okay. It's not that big a deal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 22 40 Duke:</b> Is that all?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 22 47 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative, 16. I believe that covers everything.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 22 52 Duke:</b> You know, Pete, on that battery, I took a peek at it every once and awhile during the EVA, and it didn't vent at all into the cabin.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 23 03 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 23 07 Duke:</b> My only other question is, why does the - when you vent it to one, why does it climb so rapidly back up to about 16 or so?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 23 22 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute, Charlie. We're thinking about that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 23 34 Peterson:</b> Oh, on the questions on the trying to get some Sun in the windows tomorrow, you'll be in PTC a great deal of the time; and during the - a lot of those PTCs, you will have enough sunlight in the window for interior photography.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 23 49 Duke:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 23 51 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. I just was wondering if one of the other periods might also place the Sun in our window. Because - when you do it PTC, although it comes by very often and you want to photograph a continuous sequence, it kind of chops it up pretty quickly. It takes an awful lot of planning to hit the lighting at the same time you want to do something.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 24 13 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 24 17 Mattingly:</b> But it doesn't justify another attitude or anything like that. This is just so we can get some better pictures inside.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 24 23 Peterson:</b> Okay; I'll see what I can do on that, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 26 57 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. We've got Magazine 11 that's unscheduled and has CIN film.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 27 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, thank you very much.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 30 51 Peterson:</b> 16, on the sunlight coming in the window in a fixed attitude tomorrow, the - the situation doesn't really look real good. About the best one, I guess, is at one point we'll have the Sun about 40 degrees from the normal to the hatch window and about 20 degrees - that's 40 degrees off in pitch and about 20 degrees off in yaw. So - and that's about the closest we have to having sunlight coming right down normal to any of the windows.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 31 59 Peterson:</b> Ken, I think I said that was 40 degrees in pitch and 20 degrees in yaw, and it's actually 40 degrees in pitch and 20 degrees off in roll on that Sun angle...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 32 14 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Don, I just plugged back in. Would you say again, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 32 17 Peterson:</b> Okay on this business of getting sunlight in the spacecraft windows, about the best we're gonna be able to do is one attitude gives you sunlight which is - if you take the normal to the hatch window, the Sun is about 40 degrees off of that in pitch and about 20 degrees off in roll. And that's about the closest we're going to have to having sunlight coming directly in a window. Oh, and, Ken ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 32 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Well, we'll do with what we have, then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 32 43 Peterson:</b> Okay; I've just been advised that that's not the hatch window, it's Window 5. And that attitude occurs about 269:30 in the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 32 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay; well, we'll - we'll just get all the lights as bright as we can get them, and use the standard interior procedures.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 33 02 Peterson:</b> Roger. That sounds like probably a better way to go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 33 09 Mattingly:</b> I was just thinking if we had more illumination like that, that we could save ourselves a little time. Be a better pic -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 33 35 Mattingly:</b> That's a pretty nice, slow ride, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 33 59 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 34 24 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie, are you on the loop?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 34 31 Duke:</b> Roger; go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 34 32 Peterson:</b> Okay, on this battery compartment problem. The reason for it coming back up so rapidly right after you vented is that there is pressure built up in the batteries. And when you vent the compartment, the - the batteries simply then are venting to a very low pressure or see a very low pressure. And they tend to - to vent very rapidly for a while until you get the pressure built back up, and then they vent at a much slower rate.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 34 59 Duke:</b> Okay. Fine. That makes sense. Thank you very much.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 35 04 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 43 22 Duke:</b> Houston, 16. We're going through the pre - presleep check - checklist. If you're ready, we'll send you an E-Mod.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 43 30 Peterson:</b> Stand by one. Okay, go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 45 22 Duke:</b> And, Pete, y'all satisfied with our cryo configuration for tonight?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 45 30 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 52 19 Mattingly:</b> Don, do you want us to use standard High Gain procedures tonight?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 52 25 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 52 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay; thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 57 31 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. The rates look good for a spinup.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 57 48 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 57 51 Peterson:</b> And, Charlie, we'd like one more reading on the battery compartment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 58 11 Duke:</b> It's almost about 2.4, Pete, about 2.35, I'd say now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 58 18 Peterson:</b> Okay; 2.35.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 58 21 Duke:</b> Yeah. It seems to have just about stabilized. I should say stabilized. At least the rate of increase is very slow, now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>226 58 32 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 08 41 Duke:</b> Hey, Pete. Do y'all want a E-memory dump?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 08 46 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 08 52 Duke:</b> Did you say affirmative, Pete?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 08 54 Peterson:</b> Stand by just a minute, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 08 58 Duke:</b> Okay, and I'm going to AC2 on Telcom Group - AC2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 09 02 Peterson:</b> We' re ready for the memory dump, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 09 22 Peterson:</b> Charlie, we - we would like to get the memory dump, and we'd like to keep the High Gain until we get that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 09 32 Duke:</b> Okay. Maybe I'm not up to speed. Do we lose the High Gain if I put Group 2 to AC2?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>227 09 41 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative. That's - that's why I wanted to wait until we're on the Omni to make that switch.</p>

And the crew has now completed virtually all pre-sleep activities and they'll be ready to begin their sleep period and looks as if they'll be right on the Flight Plan which calls for them to begin an 8-hour sleep period in about 30 minutes. You've heard several references to the battery compartment pressures. Also earlier on previous shift there was some discussion of a possible battery problem and looking into the situation, we have reached a conclusion that the entry batteries in the Command Module are, in fact, behaving normally. There is no problem. The earlier concern about the possibility of a problem arose from what appears to be excessive venting of the batteries. However, the amount that the batteries vented is related to the amount of charge which of course is also in turn related to the amount of usage on the batteries. These batteries are typically brought on line to supplement the fuel cells during periods of peak usage particularly during the SPS service propulsion system burns where the fuel cells don't react as quickly as a battery will to sudden load demands where the fuel cells would be inclined to react more slowly and perhaps allow the voltage to drop off. The batteries can meet those high demands peak load mode requirements and hold the voltage at the desired level. So prior to an SPS burn for example, batteries are brought on line to supplement the fuel cells. And then the batteries are recharged and to keep them at full charge or nearly full charge for the time that they'll be used during post-entry - after the Service Module is separated. Because of the - some of the problems that were encountered particularly during the descent orbit insertion and also prior to lunar orbit insertion, the batteries got a higher than normal usage which means that they also required higher than normal recharging. Because of the additional recharging and it was decided the batteries were venting and were giving off gaseous products and these were then vented more often than we would normally see. However, it was decided that this was the - to be expected and indicated no problems in the batteries. The crew is instructed to check the battery compartment pressures periodically. The venting at a higher than usual rate is continuing and the battery compartment is then - the pressure built up is relieved by the crew in order to keep pressures from building up beyond the desired limits. And that accounts for the frequent calls you've heard from Capcom to the crew to check the battery compartment pressure levels. And also you heard Charlie Duke report the last time we asked him this question that the pressure rise now appeared to have leveled off and approaching more normal - more normal levels or more normal rise rate. So again we repeat, now we see no problem with the batteries and they appear to be in very good shape for the entry and splashdown. Those events are scheduled to occur; entry at 38 hours 17 minutes, 27 seconds from now; and splashdown 38 hours, 30 minutes, 46 seconds from now. Apollo 16 at the moment is 153,508 nautical miles from Earth traveling at a speed of 4,345 feet per second.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 252 hours, 44 minutes [227:57]. The crew aboard Apollo 16 has completed all of their presleep activities and the spacecraft appears to be in good shape now for the sleep period. The Gamma Ray and Alpha Particle experiments will be operating from the Scientific Instrument Module bay during sleep. The Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly is wearing a biomedical harness and we'll be receiving heart rate data from him while the crew is sleeping. And the spacecraft is in the slow roll for Passive Thermal Control. We have some updated figures on the predicted lifetimes for the Lunar Module Orion in lunar orbit and also for the particles and field subsatellite which was ejected from the Scientific Instrument Module bay prior to the time Apollo 16 ignited its Service Propulsion System engine to start the spacecraft on its route back to Earth. The predicted LM lifetime is 343 days and the predicted orbital lifetime for the subsatellite is 192 days. We're in the process of a shift handover at the present time in Mission Control. Flight Director Gerry Griffin coming on now to replace the Flight Control team headed by Flight Director Don Puddy. We do not plan to have a change of shift press briefing following this shift.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; 252 hours, 54 minutes [228:07] Ground Elapsed Time. Two clocks counting up to, or counting down to entry and landing. 37 hours, 28 minutes plus seconds to entry and 37 hours, 41 minutes plus seconds to landing. Crew of Apollo 16 has turned off their voice downlink and presumably are closing up the spacecraft window curtains for a night's sleep. We'll take down the air-ground circuit at this time. There will be some television from the Descartes landing site area from the Ground Commanded Television Assembly, starting at about 12:30 am Central. At 252:56 [228:09], this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; 254 hours, 56 minutes [230:09] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now 35 hours and 40 minutes away from splashdown in the Pacific. Some 146,179 nautical miles out from Earth, approaching at a velocity of 4,503 feet per second. Spacecraft weight at this time 27,349 pounds. Apollo 16 crew has been asleep for better than 2 hours, some 6 hours remaining in the scheduled 8-hour rest period. And at 254:57 [230:10], this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 257 hours, 55 minutes [233:08] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 homeward bound some 32 hours, 41 minutes out from splashdown in the Pacific near the equator south of Hawaii. Apollo 16 crewmen asleep at this time. The only biomedical data [is] coming from the Command Module Pilot which shows his heart rate in the 40's - mean heart rate in the 40's. Cabin pressure now 5.5 pounds per square inch at a temperature of 66 degrees [F]. Spacecraft currently in the Passive Thermal Control mode rotating very slowly about the longitud[inal] axis. Three revolutions per hour maintain a thermal balance on all the spacecraft systems. Apollo 16 getting ever closer to Earth. Altitude now 138,160 nautical miles. Velocity continuing to build up. Now approaching at 4,690 feet per second. Flight path angle, the angle at which the spacecraft enters the atmosphere - this is relative to the local horizontal at the landing site at splashdown point - is now -6.6 degrees which is very near the desired flight path angle. Velocity predicted at this point from the tracking to be 36,196 feet per second. Spacecraft current weight 27,349 pounds. Crew has 2&frac12; hours remaining in their scheduled sleep period. And the Gold Team of Flight Controllers has about that long in their wake period. At 257:58 [233:11], this is Apollo Control.</p>

Apollo 16 now 31 hours, 41 minutes away from splashdown. Meanwhile in the central Pacific landing area, the Ticonderoga prime recovery vessel is some 85 nautical miles north of the splash point and steaming in that direction. Weather in the landing site is good at the present time. Cloud base at 2,000 feet, scattered, visibility 10 nautical miles, depending on how high you are. Wind is out of the east at l0 knots, 3 feet wave height. Splash point right now is predicted to be 44 minutes south latitude, 156 degrees, 09 minutes west longitude. That is approximately 1,310 nautical miles south of Pearl Harbor and probably 300 miles or so south of Christmas Island. Apollo 16 is now 135,707 nautical miles out from Earth, traveling at a speed of 4,750 feet per second. One hour and 39 minutes remaining of the crew's scheduled sleep period and at 258:50 [234:03] in the current Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; 259 hours, 47 minutes [235:00] Ground Elapsed Time into the mission of Apollo 16. 42 minutes until wakeup - reville for the crew. Spacecraft is presently 133,064 nautical miles out from Earth. Approaching at a velocity of 4,816 feet per second. One of the first items after wakeup will be a Flight Plan update for the balance of the day's activities which include light flash observations, a press conference which will begin at 268:10 [243:23]and run for 30 minutes with a group of questions being read up by the Capcom from the newsmen covering Apollo 16. The crew will also receive instructions on setting up a different form of Passive Thermal Control in which the spacecraft axis is pointed in a slightly different direction. Instead of being normal to the plane of the ecliptic - the longitud[inal] axis of the spacecraft normal to the plane of the ecliptic - [the] spacecraft will be tilted over to point the SIM bay experiments to a different region of the galaxy. However the roll rate will remain essentially the same. At 259:49 [235:02], this is Apollo Control.</p><a name="235_02"></a>
