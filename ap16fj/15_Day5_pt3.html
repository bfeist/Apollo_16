      <p class="tech"><b>096 19 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, on your right side. Okay: I got it, and it's moving in - It looks like a combination now. It's moving though. It's oscillating at this time. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 19 17 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, it should be stable</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>096 42 40 Mattingly:</b> It's surprising, Hank, how great things are just looking through the telescope and I can't spend much time over here with the naked eye [garble].</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>096 51 27 Hartsfield:</b> Wilco.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>096 54 12 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you very much, Hank. I'll read it back to you in just a second.

      <p class="tech"><b>096 55 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Yeah, let's get to work on these first. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 55 43 Mattingly:</b> Hank, it looks like we made a little discrepancy here in the way it is now. It shows we crossed out the Verb 48 at 97:15 to get us a 10101 because we were all ready there, I thought. And that doesn't look like the case. I guess we're gonna catch it up here after the burn. It is probably okay in its present form? Is that correct? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 56 08 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. We went to 10102 back at 96:34, and we crossed out the one at 97:15, and we figured that same DAP, and it would hold you through the burn, and then we'll go to the new DAP after the burn. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 56 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 56 30 Hartsfield:</b> The reason is being - is because we do have 509 in there. We can't do another DAP with it running. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 56 39 Mattingly:</b> Roger. Understand that. Thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 56 43 Mattingly:</b> Just want to make sure with all the changes around in this 509 that we hadn't overlooked one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>096 56 47 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 00 19 Mattingly:</b> Houston, what do you say we pass the GDC align for the COAS calibration maneuver and get back on the time line?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 00 46 Hartsfield:</b> That's a good plan, Ken. We concur.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 00 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p> <a name="CM097_04_35"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 04 35 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, while you're maneuvering there, would you want to copy the Abort Pad?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>097 14 05 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, a preliminary look at your tracking data looks real good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 14 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Good. I hope it is.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>097 16 25 Young (LM onboard):</b> Because I'm right on the floor.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>097 17 14 Duke (LM):</b> Okay, will we have a - If we use up fuel - just System A for descent, is what you want us to do.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 17 23 Irwin:</b> Stand by. We'll give you an RCS configuration for PDI when y'all come around the corner.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 17 31 Duke (LM):</b> Okay. Well, we'll be back.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 17 40 Young (LM):</b> And I'd like somebody to think about this high APS pressure we have during the lunar stay. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 17 50 Irwin:</b> Okay, we're looking at that one too, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 17 54 Young (LM onboard):</b> He doesn't know the difference between you and me. He keeps calling me you and you me.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 17 57 Duke (LM onboard):</b> I know it. That's going to bite us right there.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 18 06 Young (LM onboard):</b> That APS pressure? Yeah, we can't do that, can we? Oh, no, you stay for 3 days...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 18 11 Irwin:</b> Okay, we are noticing an increase in the RCS pressure there, but we have enough ullage volume now to get the - all the propellant out.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>097 18 28 Young (LM onboard):</b> That means you're going to let it go to the relief valve.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 18 32 Duke (LM onboard):</b> I guess so.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>097 19 26 Young (LM):</b> I think that if we're on hot mike when we're talking to each other, I want to apologize right now. It's probably pretty interesting. Probably not, if the comm was as bad as you said it was. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 19 45 Irwin:</b> It was good enough for us to understand you.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 19 51 Duke (LM onboard):</b> That's what I was afraid of (laughter).</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>097 20 06 Irwin:</b> Okay, Orion. If you see that reg pressure creeping up, you could do a small maneuver, which would help the situation.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 20 15 Duke (LM):</b> Understand; we'll do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 20 21 Young (LM):</b> We'll do a Verb 49 for the AGS cal attitude, Jim.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>097 20 33 Irwin:</b> Okay. And, Orion, we're coming up on about two minutes to LOS.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 20 43 Duke (LM onboard):</b> You want to answer him, John?</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control and both spacecraft have passed behind the Moon during the end of the 12th lunar orbit. During this pass - rather interesting frontside pass, several nagging problems have cropped up or have been carried over from the preceding revolution. One concern is the Landing Radar which in its self-test mode gave some spurious readouts, the readouts never agreeing with what the test should be. Later on in a repetition of the Landing Radar self-test, the numbers on the onboard display came out as they should. John Young speculated that perhaps because of the low altitude at the time of the first attempt at the Landing Radar self-test, they were getting some ground reflections from the lunar surface which caused the self-test to be invalid. The self-test of the Rendezvous Radar has been postponed until the upcoming backside pass prior to acquisition on Rev 13. The steerable antenna situation is still coming in and out as the steerable antenna appears to be locked in a stowed position. However, with the spacecraft attitude, oriented such that the antenna faces the Earth, we've had fairly good communications during the better part of this front side pass. The 210-foot dish at Goldstone will acquire the spacecraft at the start of Rev 13, and even if the steerable antenna is completely inoperative, all high bit rate data communications, voice, everything normally carried by the steerable antenna through the 85-foot dishes will be available on the ground. [On] the Lunar Module Reaction Control System regulator situation, the crew is still running through some procedures to manage the two systems, A and B, of the Reaction Control System aboard the Lunar Module to balance the regulator pressures for the propellants. System A appears to creep upward slightly, periodically, and by opening the cross-feed valve, venting some of the propellant into the ascent tanks, it appears that the situation will stabilize. The Descent Propulsion System throttle check and the Descent Propulsion System pressurization routines were carried out completely normally earlier in Revolution 12. Ken Mattingly, meanwhile, was given a Go to circularize with the Command Module, Casper. Ignition time for this burn is 97 hours, 40 minutes, 17 seconds. It will be a Service Propulsion System burn, [of] 99.6 feet per second. We'll circularize at about 51.8 by 68.2 [nautical miles]. This is slightly elliptical but because of the perturbations of lunar orbit, the orbit of the Command Module should be almost circular at the time of rendezvous. Acquisition: 43 minutes, 23 seconds from now, as both spacecraft coming around the front side. None of the problems mentioned with the RC Reaction Control System regulators or the steerable antenna preclude the lunar landing. Even if the S-band - steerable S-band antenna is completely inoperative, we're still go for landing using the Omni antennas through the Goldstone 210-foot dish. 42 minutes, 36 seconds away from acquisition on the PDI - or landing orbit at 97:28 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>097 29 11 Young (LM onboard):</b> Well, you said wash it out, so I left it there.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 29 12 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Oh, okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 29 21 Young (LM onboard):</b> Ain't the clearest in the world, but it's the clearest I could do, Charlie. Honest.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>097 35 03 Young (LM onboard):</b> You speak.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 35 04 Young (LM comm):</b> Go ahead, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 35 10 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I have an unstable yaw gimbal Number 2. It's just been oscillating and - oscillates in - yaw any time it gets excited.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 35 22 Young (LM comm):</b> Oh, boy.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 35 26 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> You got any quick ideas?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 35 33 Young (LM comm):</b> No, I sure don't,</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 35 41 Duke (LM comm):</b> What does your rules say, Ken?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 35 43 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> This thing says I have to have four servo loops to do the Circ [Burn]. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 35 49 Duke (LM onboard):</b> It's what?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 35 51 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Every time I put Number 2 servo on, it's okay until I disturb it, and then it starts to oscillate. And you can feel the spacecraft shaking. It's really doing it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 36 02 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay. You have to have four loops to do Circ, huh?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 36 12 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> That's what it says. It's unstable in all SCS modes on secondary servo [garble]. I can't believe it, but I'm watching it. Every time I select the secondary yaw gimbal, any excursion in the thumb-wheel to go unstable.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 36 41 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay. Well, just hold what you got then.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 36 45 Duke (LM comm):</b> Hey, Ken, why don't you just stop it and then start it again.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 36 47 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I've done that twice.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 36 50 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Oh, okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 36 58 Young (LM comm):</b> Well, let us get pointed at you and do a Verb 83.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 37 03 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay, gang. I'm sure sorry about this, but that Number 2 servo is just oscillating like a wild man.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 37 11 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 37 12 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> And I tried it both in Manual and TVC and in the - in the - just with the thumb-wheel, and I get the same response. There could be a switch here somewhere but I - I swear I've checked them all, all I can. I guess I'll power them down.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 37 32 Young (LM comm):</b> Yep, and tell the ground when you go around.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 37 35 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay. Brother, what a way to start the day, huh?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 37 41 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 37 46 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Do you suppose there's any - Let me try terminating 509 and see if that would help maybe. No, it was in SCS. That shouldn't have any effect. I wonder if we got that relay stuck in there some way.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 37 59 Young (LM onboard):</b> The TVC enable relay?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 38 02 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah. I'm gonna try my gimbal drive check anyhow - in the G&amp;N.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 38 06 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 38 33 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay, John, I'll give you some needles. Follow those needles in AGS and point to him.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 38 42 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> [Garble] no good in TVC either - in my gimbal drive check. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 38 47 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay. Which way do I go? I have to...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 38 52 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm gonna back out here and power down.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 38 56 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yaw left, pitch down.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 38 59 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay. Okay, Ken, some - some you win and some you lose. I don't see any...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 39 04 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> (Vox) 2's Off; Pitch 2's Off. Yaw 1's Off; Pitch 1's Off. Servos 1 and 2 are off.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>097 39 31 Duke (LM onboard):</b> No, good in - PGNS won't do it either? </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 39 37 Young (LM onboard):</b> That's why you don't leave the gimbals running for 20 minutes at a clip.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 39 44 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Bus Ties are coming Off; 1; 2's Off.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 40 20 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Just lost one gimbal motor, hasn't he?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 40 23 Young (LM onboard):</b> Lost a servo loop in yaw.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 40 28 Duke (LM comm):</b> Hey, Ken, is it both gimbals oscillate like that?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 40 30 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> No, the Number 2; and my burn rules say I got to have two sets of servo loops - two on each; got to have all four servo loops to go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 40 39 Young (LM comm):</b> I think that's right, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 40 40 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm sorry, gang. I don't know what to do with the darn thing. It does it both when the CMC drives it and when we drive it. I've started it, restarted it, and it's just apparently really in the servo loop.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 41 02 Young (LM onboard):</b> Instant sunrise.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 41 03 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Um-hmm.</p> <a name="097_41_13"></a>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 41 13 Young (LM comm):</b> You get there before we do or do we get there before you do?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 41 17 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I don't know; it's probably a very close race. Yeah [garble]. In fact, I guess the next thing we've got to do is make sure we don't hit.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 41 26 Young (LM comm):</b> I'll work on that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 41 28 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 42 15 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Get a little roll in there, John. I guess - you're coming around okay, though. Roll doesn't really matter.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 42 28 Young (LM onboard):</b> Oh, terrible!</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 42 52 Young (LM onboard):</b> Where is it, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 42 54 Duke (LM onboard):</b> We've got to pitch down.</p>

      <p class="oblm"><b>097 44 24 Young (LM comm):</b> There's no way to tell, T. K.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>097 45 33 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; I'm probably going to have to maneuver it so you can get a transponder. I doubt that you can get a - a lockup where I am now. Be with you in just a minute.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>097 50 12 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I got an unusually bright star. I bet that's you.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 50 17 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 50 19 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm almost pointing at you, if that's the case. I don't - That couldn't be. Must be a planet.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>097 53 27 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I'm passing through the Sun right now.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 53 45 Young (LM onboard):</b> That radar.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 17 Young (LM comm):</b> You ought to be looking right at us.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 54 18 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, what I'm looking at right now is the Sun. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 25 Young (LM comm):</b> That ought to be us.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 54 28 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Seen my attitude yet?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 30 Young (LM comm):</b> No, I can't - I can't see you at all. All I see is the light.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 54 34 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay. If you have your tracking light on, you can turn it off before you burn it out. Maybe they can figure out some way to make it useful yet.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 39 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 41 Duke (LM onboard):</b> There you go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 42 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay, we got signal strength.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 54 47 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Roger. I show you locking up.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 57 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay, go ahead and go to Auto Track, Charlie. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 54 58 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 32 Young (LM onboard):</b> Down and to the - down and to the left, Charlie. Three degrees down and right in the middle.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 40 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay, we've got it. That's what the needles say.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 42 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay. Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 44 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 47 Young (LM onboard):</b> All right. All right, we've got it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 50 Duke (LM onboard):</b> The tapemeter running [garble] we'll go to LGC, Verb 63.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 54 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 55 55 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Wait a minute [garble] all this.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 07 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 12 Duke (LM onboard):</b> [Garble] firing it, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 15 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay, we'll let's - let's do this and get out of here...</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 16 Duke (LM onboard):</b> I'm doing it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 17 Young (LM onboard):</b> ...82 and 46.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 18 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay. I got to wait until it locks up.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 19 Young (LM onboard):</b> It's locked up.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 20 Duke (LM onboard):</b> It ain't.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 28 Young (LM onboard):</b> Well, it ain't never going to with me firing these jets like this - and not looking at him.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 56 52 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Did it look like I was going over the top of you, John?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 56 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 56 58 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, I believe so. Sure does.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 00 Duke (LM comm):</b> Yeah, you are. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 02 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Keep pitching, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 04 Young (LM onboard):</b> Which way?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 05 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Up, he's going up.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 09 Young (LM onboard):</b> He's going up. He's going down underneath us.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 15 Duke (LM onboard):</b> That's right, that's right. He should go down underneath us.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 27 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay, you got to Pro on that.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 31 Duke (LM onboard):</b> It ain't locked up, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 47 Duke (LM onboard):</b> He's off to the left.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 57 59 Duke (LM onboard):</b> There was the rendezvous radar light.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 02 Young (LM onboard):</b> Huh? Yeah, it's locked - he's locked up. Good enough.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 06 Duke (LM onboard):</b> The light is not out. It is not locked up unless the light goes out.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 10 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay, but I want to get the PDI attitude.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 13 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Well, let's go to PDI and forego this.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 15 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay, we're terminating this rendezvous radar test, Ken. We're going to go to PDI attitude. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 18 Young (LM onboard):</b> Let's do a Verb 49 to that one.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 20 Duke (LM onboard):</b> No, it won't work until after you Pro at [garble] until you get a Verb...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 58 23 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay; I don't have a visual on you yet, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 28 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay. Well, we're out in front of you and we're...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 58 33 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> You're out in front?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 36 Young (LM comm):</b> That's affirmative. We're ahead of you. No, dadgummit.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 58 41 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I don't see how that could be.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 58 46 Young (LM comm):</b> Well, we're - we're upside down and the Sun is over our shoulder and we're looking back at you, and I promise that's the case.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 59 00 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I guess my nav system isn't very good.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 59 03 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay, Ken, let's just forget this. I think you went down below us, and - we're going to PDI attitude, and why don't you go to your comm attitude.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>097 59 12 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay, what I'm trying to do is to keep from hitting you. I'd like to get a visual on you.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 59 22 Young (LM comm):</b> Well.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 59 34 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Why don't you just do a pitch - getting on the belly band and do a pitch around, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 59 41 Young (LM onboard):</b> [Garble] let's [garble] those breakers.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 59 43 Duke (LM onboard):</b> He should be below us. We've passed undocking.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 59 46 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>097 59 59 Duke (LM onboard):</b> I'll load this.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 00 00 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, load the PDI attitude.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 00 12 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> My computer display shows that you're - that you're behind me.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 01 07 Young (LM comm):</b> Okay. Well, there for a while, Ken, we were locked up.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 01 08 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Can you put me against the sky or the ground, or did you?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 01 13 Young (LM comm):</b> You're against the sky about 5 degrees up - 6 degrees up.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 01 18 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 01 48 Young (LM onboard):</b> Hear the algorithm test?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 01 50 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, that's what I'm doing.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 01 55 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I've got you. You were behind me.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 02 01 Young (CM comm):</b> We are, huh?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 02 03 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I think we're about a half [garble].</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 02 05 Young (LM comm):</b> The Sun's coming over our shoulder, that's all I know.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 02 09 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Well, I guess behind is kind of relative. </p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 02 13 Young (LM comm):</b> I think you're right.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 02 16 Duke (LM onboard):</b> The clock counts backwards. Well, there you go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 02 38 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Let's go to PDI attitude then.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 02 41 Young (LM onboard):</b> That's where we're going.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 02 42 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay. Do you wait to Pro - we can Pro on this - do an auto maneuver.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 02 49 Young (LM onboard):</b> We're there, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 03 Young (LM onboard):</b> All we got to do is keep the reg light off, right?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 05 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah. You can move the COAS to the overhead window.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 12 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 21 Duke (LM onboard):</b> I know they're not going to let us do PDI, though.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 23 Young (LM onboard):</b> Huh?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 24 Duke (LM onboard):</b> They're not going to let us do it on this rev.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 25 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yep, that's right.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 33 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Looks to me like we're opening again.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 37 Duke (LM onboard):</b> There you are.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 38 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I guess we must have passed our one rev.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 39 Young (LM onboard):</b> Got it?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 41 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, there he is, right out there.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 44 Young (LM onboard):</b> How far away?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 45 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Just yaw right and you got him.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 49 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Do you still have comm, Orion?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 51 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, we do.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 52 Duke (LM comm):</b> Roger; we have a visual on you.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 53 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay, you want me to try and station-keep [garble] it drift?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 03 58 Young (LM comm):</b> Say again.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 04 02 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Would you rather I station-keep or just let it drift?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 04 07 Young (LM comm):</b> I wouldn't worry about it right now, Ken; we got to get a hold of the ground and see what they want to do.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 04 12 Mattingly CM comm):</b> I was just wondering if I'd be in a better posture if I kept stationary. That might make the abort situation on the PDI-2 better [garble] ago and one gimbal, we've got it made.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 04 22 Young (LM comm):</b> We'll see what they say.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 04 30 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> I guess we aren't going to be that far apart that it'll mess up your [garble].</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 04 37 Young (LM comm):</b> I don't think so.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 04 41 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> What time are you supposed to get Lo - get AOS?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 04 46 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Tell him 98:10.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 04 50 Young (LM comm):</b> 98:10.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 04 56 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 04 59 Young (LM onboard):</b> Where is he?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 00 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay; let's start - let's go through this...</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 02 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 03 Duke (LM onboard):</b> ...We don't have our helmets and gloves on, I guess there's no need to do that.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 05 Young (LM onboard):</b> No. VHF Antenna, Forward.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 07 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay; I got that.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 08 Young (LM onboard):</b> CB(11) Inverter 1, Close.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 11 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Closed.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 13 Young (LM onboard):</b> Select to Inverter 1.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 15 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay, Stab/Control - You want to go through this?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 18 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, man.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 20 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay, Stab/Control (11) AELD, Close.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 21 Young (LM onboard):</b> Go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 23 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay. Stab/Control Abort Stage, Close.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 25 Young (LM onboard):</b> Go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 26 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Reset Engine Stop.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 27 Young (LM onboard):</b> Engine Stop is reset.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 29 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Set window bars.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 31 Young (LM onboard):</b> Set the crash bars.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 34 Young (LM onboard):</b> Oh, you!</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 38 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay. I'll put the Batts - Batts on.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 43 Young (LM onboard):</b> I see why you taped yours down.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 05 46 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 03 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Put your attitude monitor on PGNS, John.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 08 Young (LM onboard):</b> Is that - is that the angle that you put them in, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 11 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Those angles, I can't load them - I don't know - Those things have nothing to do with the FDAI.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 13 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay; let me load it.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 19 Duke (LM onboard):</b> It ain't going to work. You can't read off of that and load Noun 22 and have it go to that attitude.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 31 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, you're right. Well, what was the old nominal PDI attitude? That's close enough.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 38 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Well, if you call Verb 63...</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 40 Young (LM onboard):</b> No.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 41 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay; just maneuver to 114 Pitch.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 43 Young (LM onboard):</b> 314.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 06 58 Duke (LM onboard):</b> 002.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 07 00 Young (LM onboard):</b> 002 Roll.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 07 04 Duke (LM onboard):</b> And 340 Yaw.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 07 06 Young (LM onboard):</b> 340 Yaw.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 07 46 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Well, I'll tell you what. I'm going to turn off these ascent batteries. We don't need those. They ain't going to let us go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 32 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 34 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 42 Young (LM onboard):</b> You got it?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 44 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Got what?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 45 Young (LM onboard):</b> See Ken out there?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 46 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, I see Ken.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 47 Young (LM onboard):</b> Where is he?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 08 52 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 02 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Is it just - is it just an SCS where the servo loop is out?</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 07 Young (LM onboard):</b> Yeah, it's in both systems. The G&amp;N won't do it either, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 12 Duke (LM comm):</b> Hey, Ken, the G&amp;N won't do the gimbal drive right either?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 09 16 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> No, sir. It goes unstable too.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 18 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Oh.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 09 19 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> It's an honest-to-god instability in the servo loop.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 32 Young (LM onboard):</b> What should we acquire them on here? Should be - we should he getting them now, Charlie. 98:10.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 39 Duke (LM onboard):</b> Well, the Earth's - ain't come up yet.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 41 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay. Let me see the Timeline Book.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 45 Duke (LM onboard):</b> There you go.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 09 50 Young (LM onboard):</b> Okay. Reset the window bars; AELD, close. Throttle Control to Auto and Cdr. That's Go. Throttle is Min.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 09 59 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> It turns out I got a switch out of place over here. I don't know whether something could come of that, but I'm pretty convinced that it's got to be a hardware-type problem.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 10 12 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, I don't - I don't think a switch can do that to you.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 10 16 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> I don't think so. I'd like to find the switch right now</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 10 21 Young (LM onboard):</b> Did you try both sets of AC 1 and AC 2 on it?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 10 23 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Yes, sir.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 10 24 Young (LM comm):</b> Yeah, I figured.</p>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 10 38 Duke (LM onboard):</b> There it comes.</p> <a name="098_10_45"></a>
      <p class="oblm"><b>098 10 45 Duke (LM comm):</b> Okay, Ken, we're getting Earthrise.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>098 10 47 Mattingly (CM comm):</b> Yeah, I got my high gain set up.</p>
