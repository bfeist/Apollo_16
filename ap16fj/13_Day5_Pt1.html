We're standing by now awaiting a wake-up call by CapCom DonPeterson to the crew of Apollo 16. We show Apollo 16 presently with anapolune of 58.9 nautical miles [109.1 kilometres] and a perilune of10.4 nautical miles [19.3 kilometres].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 25 41 Peterson</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 25 51 Peterson</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 26 25 Mattingly:</b> How you down there this morning, Houston?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 26 27 Peterson</b> Just fine. How are you, 16?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 26 35 Mattingly:</b> Charging hard.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 26 37 Peterson</b> Roger. Got about three short items and a SIM bay status, if you're ready.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 26 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Can we hold off on the SIM bay status? And I'll copy your three short items.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 26 55 Peterson</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 26 58 Peterson</b> Okay. The first one is -based on our evaluation, your potassium levels are running a littlelow, and we'd like to recommend that you drink some orange juice thismorning. Also, you've got a long day ahead of you, so we'd like torecommend that you eat a bit more food. Second item is terminateBattery Bravo charge. The third item is terminate the jet-on monitor.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 27 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 28 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. Number one, I understand your comment about the potassium low and all that jazz. We've just finished up breakfast, and I think we've eaten almost everything that the LMies have to eat. And we - we've been drinking all the drinks every day. And, if we get a chance, we'll try to get some more - get another juice bag out. We will terminate the Battery B charge and terminate the Jet Monitor, and I understand the way to do the Jet Monitor is - I'll go to - I'll go to the SCS mode and key a Verb 37 Noun 20 and then verify that Noun 26 isn't all zeros again. And I can go back to P20. is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 28 55 Peterson</b> Stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 29 02 Peterson</b> There's no requirement to go to SCS, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 29 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I can just call [Verb] 37 [Noun] 20 without getting any firings?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 31 10 Peterson</b> 16, just to be sure we'retalking the same thing - to kill the jet-on Monitor, we want to do aVerb 37 Enter, 30 Enter, a Verb 37 Enter, 20 Enter and zero the Noun 26.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 32 05 Mattingly:</b> Don, I can't get to theUpdates Book where that's written down. Would you read it to me slowly,and I'll do that terminate right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 32 11 Peterson</b> Okay, it's Verb 37 Enter, 30 Enter, Verb 37 Enter, 20 Enter, zero the Noun 26.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 32 31 Peterson</b> And, 16, you're about one minute to LOS, and you're looking good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 32 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And we're taking an extra orange with potassium this morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 32 43 Peterson</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 33 06 Mattingly:</b> Houston, 16. Take a look at that biomed off of me and see how it looks. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 33 14 Peterson</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 33 20 Mattingly:</b> I got it reset - from yesterday.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 33 28 Peterson</b> Ken, still looks a little loose.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 33 35 Mattingly:</b> Well, it's not loose.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 33 40 Peterson</b> We'll have to take a better look at it next time around, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 33 48 Young:</b> Okay. This is John, and the sensors are fixed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 34 01 Peterson</b> We've got confusion down here on who we're monitoring, John.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 34 42 Peterson</b> John, the lead we're concerned with is the sternal lead - the one on your breastbone. You might jiggle it a little bit.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 35 05 Young:</b> Gee, we're doing that. It sure looks like it's all tight.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 35 09 Peterson</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>091 35 35 Peterson</b> John, you might try putting new sponges on that lead.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>091 35 43 Young:</b> Okay. I did that last night.</p>
