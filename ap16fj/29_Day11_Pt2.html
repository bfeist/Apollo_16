      <p class="tech"><b>241 23 02 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, the SIM Bay's warmed up and - it looks like we give the computer and the software a clean bill of health. And we're suspecting we might of had a - a transient or something in the CDUs, so G&C would like to maneuver back to about the attitude where we had this thing and sweep out plus or minus 5 degrees in each axis one at a time and see if we can get another glitch. Now, we're trying to search those low-order bits because we think that's where the problem occurred. The attitude is 182.5, 130.7, 039.7, and we'd like for you to stay in SCS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 23 55 Mattingly:</b> Can you tell me why you want to stay in SCS, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 24 05 Hartsfield:</b> Just to be conservative, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 24 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's just - All right.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> The SCS is the Stabilization Control System. The backup system which they'll use to maneuver Apollo 16 to the attitudes where we saw the Program Alarm earlier. At the present time software looks good and this is a procedure in an effort to check out the hardware. We show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 114,237 nautical miles velocity now reads 5,345 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston; 266 hours, 19 minutes [241:32] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 now maneuvering to the spacecraft attitudes where we had earlier seen the Program Alarm. The intent here is to try and duplicate the problem. We'll standby and continue to monitor.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 35 41 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, when you get to the attitude, we'd like to sweep this 5-degree band there with a very low rate, say maybe using Minimum Impulse.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 36 02 Young:</b> You guys wouldn't want to consider the very conservative approach of just avoiding this 5-degree area on the 8-ball, would you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 36 15 Hartsfield:</b> Well, we don't want to do that yet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 36 19 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 38 06 Mattingly:</b> You want a sweep of one axis at a time? Is that what you're talking about, Hank? Say like from - 125 to 135 in the - in the pitch?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 38 18 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 38 21 Mattingly:</b> I see.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 39 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, do you have any preferred axis first? We'll take yaw first.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 39 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 41 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, is 5 degrees sufficient to cover all your bits?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 41 52 Hartsfield:</b> They're checking. That'll do it, Ken. Five degrees will cover the low-order bits.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 42 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Going back the other way with yaw.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control Houston at 266 hours, 28 minutes [241:41] Ground Elapsed Time. That's Ken Mattingly maneuvering the Apollo 16 spacecraft in varying attitudes within a 5-degree range in pitch, and roll and yaw, in an effort to duplicate the program alarm that we had seen earlier. We now show Apollo 16 at an altitude of 113,314 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity now reads 5,373 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 47 38 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, we'd like to do roll next - for the next axis.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 47 44 Mattingly:</b> Oh, very well.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> Apollo Control Houston at 266 hours, 43 minutes [241:56] Ground Elapsed Time. Ken Mattingly continuing to slowly maneuver the Apollo 16 spacecraft in attitudes. He has completed a checkout in roll and yaw and is now in the process of completing the maneuvering ranges in pitch attitude. We'll standby and continue to monitor. We now show Apollo 16 with an altitude of 112,511 nautical miles and a velocity of 5,399 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 59 05 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, what do I do at the end of this little sweep?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 59 13 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We didn't get it, did we?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 59 22 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. Sure didn't.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>241 59 35 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by a second, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 00 21 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. Here's the plan. The G&C gives a hardware clean bill of health. So, I - they're going to smoke over the data now and look at why we got that little transient in there. In the meantime, it looks like we're safe to proceed with the Flight Plan. We'd like to pick it up at 267 - go into this Sco X-1 attitude. And, since we're real fat on RCS fuel, we'd like to do the maneuvers between these different attitudes today where we're getting data in different - different attitude at a faster rate, a half degree per second. And if that's all right with you, then, we'll get the X-ray on now which is called for in the Flight Plan and then start maneuver into the Sco X attitude and I guess we can use CMC for that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 01 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll - I concur with using the CMC and do you have any feel for midcourse 7?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 01 27 Hartsfield:</b> I'll get an answer on that, Ken. Right now, it's looking like about 3 feet per second, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 01 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I can - think we can cover that.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 266 hours, 51 minutes [242:04] Ground Elapsed Time. We've completed our troubleshooting with Apollo 16 trying to sort out the earlier program alarm which occurred. The assessment here at this time is that - it was [a] transient glitch. We will review the data, but presently press on with the flight plan moving forward by some 10 minutes, the X-ray pointing experiment. We now show Apollo 16 at 112,135 nautical miles away from the Earth and travelling at a speed of 5,411 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 06 49 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Omni Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 07 17 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Command Reset, and Omni Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 11 43 Mattingly:</b> Houston, 16. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 11 50 Hartsfield:</b> Say again, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 11 54 Mattingly:</b> Thought I'd just send y'all - got you back on the Omni - or correction, High Gain now, Hank. Say how do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 12 00 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Read you 5 by 5 and we got High Bit Rate and locked up, looks like.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 18 05 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, if you got a minute. I've got a little procedure here we want to try. Another little troubleshoot, if you're free.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 18 14 Young:</b> Just a minute. We'll get him back on comm.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 18 44 Mattingly:</b> Hello, Henry.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 18 46 Hartsfield:</b> Hello, there. We got something we'd like to try here, and its purpose is to determine whether or not the time delay on the CDU fail detection circuitry is so short that - apparently normal CDU movements can trigger the alarm. Now the normal time delay is 2 to 10 seconds. And we got a procedure here we'd like for you to run and time - time this thing, and see if that might be our culprit.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 19 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Read it to me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 19 22 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We'd like for you to go the SCS control, Min, Low, and uncage BMAG so we can hold this attitude pretty close. Then we'll do a Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 12 Enter, 20 Enter, 1 Enter, and when you Enter on the 1, we want you to start your stopwatch, and as accurately as possible, get the time from the Enter until you get to ISS warning light. And after you get...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 20 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay. So this channel 12 is gonna - is setting the bit that is the ISS warning bit that comes from the hardware, and the computer is the thing that does the timing. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 20 15 Hartsfield:</b> What that's doing is zeroing the CDUs. And that - that guarantees you a fail. Okay, and as - as soon as you get the accurate time on that, we'll do a - a Verb 40 Enter, and wait 10 seconds for the CDUs to recover.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 20 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll do that, and then I'll call the steps out as I go through it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 20 49 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And be advised that the CMC DAP is inoperative between the time you set the bit and the time you do the Verb 40.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 21 00 Mattingly:</b> Also for 10 seconds thereafter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 21 03 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 21 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay, we're in SCS. Deadband Min, the Rate's Low, limit cycles On, we've got the BMAGs uncaged. You're watching this too, John?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 21 31 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we're looking down here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 21 36 Mattingly:</b> All set. There's Verb 25 Noun 7 Enter, 12 Enter, 20 Enter, 1 - Is it Noun? I am Enter, Reset. Okay. Here we go; 5, 4, 3, 2, Enter. I got 5 seconds.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 22 12 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That's a normal indication. That eliminates that as a possible source, so you can go ahead and do your Verb 40 and recover and go back to CMC control.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 22 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, back in CMC.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 22 58 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, we're ready to get the Alpha Particle X-Ray Cover, Open.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 23 34 Mattingly:</b> It was already open, Hank.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 23 37 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 23 38 Mattingly:</b> I think he wants to verify that.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control Houston, at 267 hours, 10 minutes [242:23] Ground Elapsed Time. The purpose of that exercise was to determine whether or not the CDU failed detection circuitry was so short that fairly normal CDU movements might trigger the alarm. This eliminated that as a possible...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 24 05 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. Like to get a check on the battery compartment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 24 14 Young:</b> 2.7.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 24 17 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. 2.7.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 24 20 Young:</b> Make it 2.65.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>242 36 05 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. We need the X-Ray Off for 2 seconds and then back On.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 26 19 Hartsfield:</b> The purpose of that, Ken, is to set the logic. Looks like it isn't set properly.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 36 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You have it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>242 51 16 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. Since we just did a P52 a few minutes back, we'll scrub the one that's scheduled at 268 hours [243:13] prior to the TV.</p> <a name="242_51_28"></a>

      <p class="obcm"><b>243 16 49 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah, it did help.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 16 50 Young (onboard):</b> I think it did.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>243 22 52 Young (onboard):</b> And we could - and we could maneuver the vehicle to (garble) the stars. I mean, there's no doubt in my mind what you (garble) see. You can recognize the patterns out here.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 07 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, what I did the other night works like a champ.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 10 Young (onboard):</b> It sure does. Man, it worked like a champ. Sure a good way to do it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 15 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 16 Young (onboard):</b> Let's do that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 17 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You never - you never get screwed up that way. You can't miss the Sun; you can't miss the Moon.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 23 Young (onboard):</b> Let's do that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 24 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. The accuracy you get was - well, enough to get auto optics to put the stars down. No, it's in the sextant.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 31 Young (onboard):</b> You still (garble) ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 32 Mattingly (onboard):</b> No sense in fooling around wasting time looking for ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 34 Young (onboard):</b> Well, let's do - let's do that then.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 36 Duke (onboard):</b> Do what?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 38 Young (onboard):</b> That.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 39 Mattingly (onboard):</b> The thing I'm worried about is if you coarse align, and it doesn't work, then what have you got?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 45 Young (onboard):</b> Well, let's align the SCS like we did before.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 50 Duke (onboard):</b> Do it just like you've been doing except torque - except pulse torquing. Why don't you do that?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 23 56 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's awfully (garble) If you coarse align, and it doesn't work, I don't know what kind of a failure mode that leaves you in.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 04 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay. They're about to come up. Why don't you give me the Flight Plan? (Yawn)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 09 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I'll just stuff it up here.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 11 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 16 Young (onboard):</b> Let me get up about like this. That'll be halfway between you and Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 20 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 21 Young (onboard):</b> (Garble) Try and slide in there. There you go. That's good.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 26 Duke (onboard):</b> I - I ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 24 24 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. We're about ready to go here. You want to try to bring up the TV?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 24 31 Young:</b> Okay; it's in work.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 B1 Young (onboard):</b> Okay; it's in work. Going to Transmit. Doesn't show. Okay. Then (garble) better go to Transmit.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 41 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah. You know that's a way to get to the patch in there. If you just - if you just drive up towards that camera, Charlie, that one on your patch flows right up and looks great. That's a good way to end it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 53 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 24 55 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Once you reach over for the Transmit switch, you just got to try to keep that ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 24 57 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We've got a picture now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 25 03 Duke:</b> Super! How does it look?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 25 07 Hartsfield:</b> Looks pretty good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 25 08 Young:</b> How does everything look to you?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 25 09 Hartsfield:</b> Pretty good.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 25 12 Duke (onboard):</b> Come down just a little bit, Ken. There you go.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 25 15 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Which way is down? (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 25 16 Duke (onboard):</b> That - this way, towards me. That's good.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 25 19 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Looks like I'm - you know ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 25 18 Hartsfield:</b> Other than the fact you're looking pretty woolly now, that's not bad.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 25 25 Duke:</b> (Laughter) Keeps you warm.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 25 29 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Where did it go?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 25 30 Duke (onboard):</b> It's going right towards the (Garble).</p> <a name="243_25_30"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 25 30 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, the questions in this press conference have been prepared by newsmen covering the flight here at the Manned Spacecraft Center. I'm going to read them to you exactly as worded by the newsmen and in a priority specified by them. Question number 1 for John Young: A couple of times you were on hot mike and didn't know it, but how could a nice Florida boy like you say what you did about citrus fruit?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 26 03 Young:</b> That's a very good question. Wait'll you drink it day and night for 2 weeks, and - and let me know what you think. And for lunch, too.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 26 15 Hartsfield:</b> Question number 2 ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 26 16 Young:</b> I - I have an orange grove - I have an orange grove down in Florida, too, so I do like citrus, but citrus drinks are something else.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 26 32 Hartsfield:</b> Question 2: When the CSM circularization burn could not be performed on schedule, did you think you wouldn't be able to land on the Moon?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 26 47 Young:</b> I thought - we all had serious doubts about whether we're going to be able to do it or not. Right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 26 56 Hartsfield:</b> Question number 3 in three parts. Were you surprised at the rocks and other formations at the Cayley site?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 27 10 Duke:</b> I think we were. The - the original impression had been mostly volcanics to look for, and I don't think we found the - the highest percentage of volcanics as we had originally anticipated. So the rocks that we found were unique, that we had never seen before in any of the lunar samples, we feel, and so it was a surprise.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 27 39 Hartsfield:</b> Do you think your geological training properly prepared you to describe them?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 27 50 Young:</b> I think so, under the circumstances. You see, most of the rocks are - were dust covered apparently by the - by the two impacts, North Ray and South Ray. It had just thrown a big blanket of dust out across there, and we saw very few rocks that were clean un - until we cut into them. And you don't want to take too much time to stop and whack off a piece of rock, because it's pretty hard to do in a pressure suit. So we were just describing them more by shape and softness and friability and things like that. And that really doesn't take a lot of training, but I think we've had adequate training to do this kind of a job.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 28 40 Hartsfield:</b> Did you see anything specifically volcanic?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 28 50 Duke:</b> As far as craters go, Hank, we think we saw two that had the shape we called endogenic that had the shape of very subdued old cinder cones or something of that nature. They were - In other words, they were - look more like, well, sink holes, really, with the surrounding topography. They had no rim on them; and, to us, it looked like it might have been a source for some - volcanic activity way, way back.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 29 27 Hartsfield:</b> Question 4: Several times at North Ray you mentioned, "Don't get too close to the edge." Did you think that if you had fallen in, you wouldn't have been able to get out?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 29 39 Young:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 29 43 Duke:</b> (Laughter) Yeah. You bet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 29 44 Young:</b> If we had fallen in we would not have been able to get out. That's correct.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 29 50 Hartsfield:</b> Question 5: The heat flow experiment you broke was successfully fixed in simulation, although it was complicated and took a great deal of time. Do you think you should have tried to fix it or do what you did?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 30 07 Young:</b> I don't think we're qualified to make that decision. It was made by people on the ground that are far more qualified to do that sort of thing than we are. If - if we had been told to do that, we would have certainly done it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 30 23 Hartsfield:</b> Would you like to have been informed of the successful sinta - simulation and the trade-off factors involved?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 30 31 Young:</b> I - I still don't think that that's our decision making process up there on the surface.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 30 40 Hartsfield:</b> Question 6: You've had a lot of equipment trouble during this mission. Is there a common thread running through all these problems for which you could suggest an explanation?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 30 56 Mattingly:</b> Yeah. I think space flight's kind of complicated. You got a lot of sophisticated equipment here that you're trying to get all working at one time. I think that's what we built a redundancy in for, and it seems to be paying off quite well.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 31 12 Young:</b> Yeah. I don't - I don't think there's any relation between any of these failures, one to another. I - I don't think there's any common thread. I agree with Ken. It's very complicated gear. It has to run for long periods of time, and you've got to expect some times that it won't run, and you got to know how to fix it, and that's why they send us on these trips.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 31 37 Hartsfield:</b> Question 7 for Ken: Your observations of the landing site. Did you see the Lunar Module or the Rover, and did you see any differences between Cayley and Descartes?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 31 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's two distinct questions. First thing, did I see it? We never pointed the sextant at the landing site according to the Flight Plan because of the alterations we had. And there were two occasions, once when I thought I caught a glint of light, which I could not recognize as the LM but which came from the location where I think the LM probably was sitting. And that was very close to the position on my map that you folks read up to me. And once, as Rover was starting up on Stone Mountain, I just happened to be looking as they went by, and I think you were on the shift, Hank, and told me that they were hitting Stone Mountain, and I looked over there, and about that time I got another little flash of light, which is about all, with the 10-power optics we have, that - that I think you could expect to see. At no time could you see something you could identify.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 32 46 Hartsfield:</b> The second part of that question was: Did you see any differences between Cayley and Descartes?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 32 54 Mattingly:</b> Yes, I think there's a distinctly different morphology involved in these two units. Our pre-flight training is a little different in impression than what I think I saw; and, again, we have, like I say, a 10-power resolution. I think the - the real answer of what this material is, is going to lay in analyzing the data post-flight. We have some good film records, and I think the - When you put that together with the rocks we picked up, we'll have a pretty powerful story that'll explain a lot of things we don't know now. But I think that there are sections of material we called Descartes, particularly the material that makes up Stone and Smoky, and that stuff runs all the way south down to the old Descartes Crater for which the region is named. And that does look texturally entirely different from the Cayley formation.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 33 46 Hartsfield:</b> Question number 8, again for Ken: What were your impressions of the back side of the Moon, and were there any surprises?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 33 57 Mattingly:</b> Well, the impression of the back side is something I tried to collect from the time we got there until the time we left. And I'm still mulling that over in my mind. I've got a lot of transcripts we're going to have to read before I can psych it all out. But, in general, the impression I have is that the material on the back side, when you look at it on as small a detail as I could look, looks to me like it's very much like the material we find on the front side surrounding most of the big craters. The thing that looks different is that the back side is devoid of these large basins. We don't have the large mares; there's very little mare. In fact, on the back side the only mare we saw was really post-TEI, when we could look back and see a big area. But our ground-track didn't pass over any mare in the daylight, so it took a while to psych that out. But I think that was a major difference was the absence of these large basins. And, on the back side, did we see surprises? Well, we went up looking for - with a suspicion that we might find material similar to the Descartes formation located in several areas on the back side, and, indeed, I think we did. I think we saw an awful lot. I think we saw a lot that looks exactly like the Cayley. I think the things that I saw that were - Probably the most surprising thing was the - On the side of a crater called Guyot, which is just to the north and a little west of King Crater - which is right about the eastern limb of the Moon when you look at it from the Earth - we saw a big hole, I'll call it a crater, in the side of this - of the wall of this crater, and it appeared that there was material oozing out. And on our last couple of revs, we passed almost directly overhead, and it looked like it was filled with a pool of material, and then this material had run down the side. And that's a formation typical of things you see like in Hawaii, something I have not seen anywhere else on the Moon, nor have I seen a picture of it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 36 03 Hartsfield:</b> Question number 9 for John and Charlie: At the tag end of EVA-3, you appeared to be having a high-jump competition. Who won, and how high do you think you jumped?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 36 19 Young:</b> No, we weren't having a competition. We were just showing you some of the things you could do with a 360-pound mass that only weighs 60 pounds, even slowed down, if you will, by the pressure suit. And I don't think anybody won. We were just demonstrating what you can do with the suit.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 36 44 Hartsfield:</b> Question 10 ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 36 45 Young:</b> I don't have any idea how we - how high we jumped. You'll have to look at the TV. Maybe - maybe a foot or two feet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 36 56 Duke:</b> It was too high for me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 02 Hartsfield:</b> Question 10: Could you ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 04 Duke:</b> Still have a picture, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 05 Hartsfield:</b> ...Explain the circumstances surrounding the failure of the Lunar Module Ascent Stage to de-orbit?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 16 Duke:</b> I think that has to be worked out when we've looked at all the data - on the ground and discuss it with the flight controllers. At the present time, I have no idea.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 29 Young:</b> No, I don't either.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 34 Hartsfield:</b> Question 11: To what extent ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 36 Mattingly:</b> Hank, could you verify that you still have a picture? We've lost our monitor, and just like to make sure there's nothing wrong with the camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 37 45 Hartsfield:</b> We have a good picture. Question 11: To what extent did fatigue affect your performance? For example, do you feel that you would have been capable of a full 7-hour EVA-3, lift-off, and LM jettison all in the same day?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 38 09 Young:</b> I think that'd been pushing it a little.
      <p class="tech"><b>243 38 12 Hartsfield:</b> Question 12, for each of you ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 38 16 Young:</b> We could probably - we could probably have done it, but I think that'd really been pushing it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 38 25 Hartsfield:</b> Question 12 for each of you: What do you hope to tell your grandchildren as your most memorable moment of your trip to the Moon?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 38 40 Duke:</b> Well, I'll start with that one, Hank. I have two impressions. The first is the dazzling beauty of Descartes - the surface. It was just one of the most awe-inspiring sights I've ever seen. And secondly, on the EVA, when you look away from the Earth - or the Moon - it's just the utter blackness of space. It really is black out there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 39 12 Young:</b> Time number 53 you said that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 39 XX Young (onboard):</b> Go ahead, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 39 22 Mattingly:</b> Well, I guess I'm next then. I - I thought of - I knew someone would ask that question, and I've been asking that question, too. And I don't think I can put an impression. There's so many that we've crammed in in the last 12 days. And it seems like each one comes on top of the other one, and the immediate response that you come up with is "That's the most fantastic thing I've ever seen." In - in a lot of respects, it really is. There - there have been so many events and so many sights that, in my case, I'm going to have to sit and think about this one for a long time before I could ever pick out one, and then I'm not sure I'll ever be able to say that there was a unique thing, or a most memorable event. The whole thing has been a - just one series of very impressive, and I hate to use the word, but I don't know anything else except to say, "It's fantastic."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 40 11 Young:</b> I think Ken's got the answer. I think we've seen as much in - in 10 days as most people see in 10 lifetimes. And we certainly have enjoyed it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 40 26 Hartsfield:</b> Question 13: From an astronaut's point of view, would you discuss the possible operation - operational difficulties, besides language, to be overcome in the proposed joint US-USSR manned space flight? And would you have any suggestions to make?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 40 47 Young:</b> (Laughter) From an astronaut's point of view, I'd - I would not feel qualified to discuss it, other than to say that if language is a problem, I'll be glad to learn Russian. I think Charlie and Ken feel the same way.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 41 06 Hartsfield:</b> Question 14: Did the potassium in your diet affect the taste of the food, and did it cause any other problems?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 41 18 Crew (onboard):</b> (Laughter)</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 41 20 Young:</b> That's a very good question, and I - I'm not sure we're qualified to - to say. We'll have to get back and talk to everybody. I - I don't think it - I didn't notice it being in there as far as taste was concerned. And I don't think anybody else did.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 41 41 Duke:</b> Yeah. This is one of those things where you have to wait and take a look at - in our post-flight medicals and see what they come up with as our body potassium level, because that's really the part that they're trying to work on, and I'm afraid the guys on the ground have a lot more data than we have on our physical condition, other than the fact that we know that we feel good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 41 59 Young:</b> Yeah, I think - I think we've been very fortunate to do as much of the mission as we have, considering - considering how much we got slowed there. And I don't know whether potassium had anything to do with it or not, but if it did, I'm sure grateful that we were taking it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 42 22 Hartsfield:</b> Question 15 for John: What did you mean when you said, "Morale went up a couple of hundred percent after the successful TEI." Was it low?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 42 41 Young:</b> Yes, that's a - No, not particularly. It's just - It would sure be low if you didn't get off the TEI burn, I can tell you that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 43 00 Hartsfield:</b> Question 16 for each of you: Based on your experience, do you have any recommendations right now for the crew of Apollo 17?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 43 15 Young:</b> Yeah, I recommend they enjoy it as much as we did. I'm sure they will, because, I tell you, we really have - we really have had a lot of sights to see. I'll admit that, in a lot of cases, we worked hard, and - and I suppose the people on the ground were able to tell that. But we got all the support in the world from the - MCC-Houston. I - I mean, I could tell, from every decision that came up from the ground, that there had been a lot of work put into it, and all around the country that there were a lot of wheels turning and people working late hours and solving these problems. And I'm just really happy that Ken, Charlie, and myself got to do this. And I think it's a wonderful experience.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 44 06 Hartsfield:</b> That was the last question, John. We thank you very much, and thank you for the kind comments.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 44 12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Why don't you read (garble) ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 44 13 Duke (onboard):</b> ...(garble) say the words?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 44 14 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 44 15 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Why don't you say ...</p> <a name="243_44_15"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 44 15 Young:</b> Well, let me just say one thing, Hank, and that is - Mr Descartes said it. He said, "There's nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it." And you all know Descartes was a French mathematician and philosopher for whom the region was named. And I guess, really, the story of our mission so far is we've been out testing his theory. My personal assessment of where we are right now, as soon as we get the rocks back in the LRL, we'll be making headway toward proving he was right.</p> <a name="243_45_00"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 45 00 Hartsfield:</b> Good show, John.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 45 04 Duke:</b> Okay. Hank, as the LEB sinks slowly into the distance, we'll say goodbye.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 45 08 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Good show. Right on.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 45 22 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, thank you.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 45 24 Duke (onboard):</b> Well, it wasn't bad.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>243 45 26 Young (onboard):</b> Was your morale low before TEI?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>243 59 18 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 59 22 Duke:</b> Go ahead.</p> <a name="243_59_23"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 59 23 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. I got a sort of an outline of our plans here for the rest of the day. You might want to jot these down on your scratch pad, Ken, and then you can operate on the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>243 59 35 Duke:</b> Okay; Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 00 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Hank, why don't you go ahead?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 00 40 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. In absence of any thermal problems, this Sco X-1 we're in now is going to run until 270:30 [245:43].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 00 52 Mattingly:</b> Understand; 270:30 [245:43].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 00 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And at the termination - or at 270:30 [245:43], we want you to immediately maneuver to the Skylab attitude, Skylab contamination, and, as soon as you get in attitude, do the photo sequence B - Skylab contamination photo sequence B - and Skylab dump sequence. And do those as quickly as possible. And, in the Dump sequence, number 3, it now reads "Do it 30 minutes after sequence 1." Make that "15 minutes after sequence 1."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 01 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay; we'll stay with Sco X-1 until 270:30 [245:43]. Then we'll go to Skylab photo sequence B and we'll press right through that and the dump sequences. And we'll do dump sequence number 3 at 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes, and we're ready to press on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 01 54 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Then, after that, maneuver immediately to attitude of Noun 20 per roll, 128, 042; and we want to do the ecliptic Aux PTC with a minus 0.3 rate and a 2-degree dead band. And that's what we started at 264 hours [239:13] when we got the glitch.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 02 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You want the - the completion of the dump sequences; you want to go to Noun 20 roll, 128 Pitch, 042 in yaw, which will start the ecliptic Aux PTC mode. We'll use 2-degree deadband and minus 0.3 of a degree per second rates.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 02 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And it doesn't say how long we're going to ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 02 49 Mattingly:</b> I can use the thruster configuration I have now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 02 52 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. Use the same con - thruster configuration we had before, and when we finish that sequence - and I'll get you a time on that a little later how long we do that - we're going to go to the ecliptic Aux PTC for the Cyg X-1 photos. And that'll be - at 273:15 [248:28], we want to do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 03 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Hank, I didn't follow that. I thought we were in the ecliptic Aux PTC at - for this earlier maneuver. So - say again what happens at 273:15 [248:28].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 03 27 Hartsfield:</b> At 273:15 - Excuse me; I may have - I read it to you wrong, Ken. We want to go to the Cyg X-1 point per the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 03 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay; at 273:15 [248:28], you'd like to go to the Cyg X-1 per the Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 03 46 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And we want to continue with the 0.5 - degree per second rates in these maneuvers to try to make up as much time as possible until we get back on the Flight Plan at 273:15 [248:28]. And, if we have any thermal problems, just to read you in on what we're thinking, we'll scrub the Skylab contamination first, and the ecliptic Aux second, as required.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 04 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay. When you say Skylab contamination, you talking about both the dump and the sequence B, or just - are you referring to sequence B?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 04 23 Hartsfield:</b> It'll be the whole works, if we have a thermal problem.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 04 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay,</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 04 33 Hartsfield:</b> And that's our plan, Ken. Is there any question on that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 04 39 Mattingly:</b> No; I think I understand what you want to do.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>244 04 41 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 269 hours, 13 minutes [244:26]. We've completed a shift hand over in Mission Control and the Flight Director at the present time is Donald Puddy and our Spacecraft Communicator on this shift is Astronaut Donald Peterson. There will be a change of shift briefing. We expect that that will begin in a little less than 30 minutes at 4:45 pm Central Standard Time. This briefing will be in the News Center Briefing Room, Building 1 at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Again that time estimated at 4:45 pm. A short while ago Capcom Don Peterson read up to the crew the numbers that will be used in the Mid-Course Correction 7. The final Mid-Course prior to Entry is scheduled to occur at about 3 hours before Entry tomorrow at Ground Elapsed Time of 287:22:56, 287 hours, 22 minutes [and] 56 seconds [262:36:54]. And that is our updated Flight Plan time. With Entry occurring at [a] Flight Plan time of 290 hours, 23 minutes [and] 22 seconds [265:37:20]. Our preliminary numbers on events following entry are as follows: The Entry Interface angle as a result of this Mid-Course Correction should be minus 6 and a half degrees, or 6 and a half degrees below local horizontal, which is nominal. 16 seconds after Entry we predict the spacecraft will enter the period of blackout for ionization, [which] blacks-out radio communication. Blackout should end after 3 minutes 32 seconds or rather 3 minutes 32 seconds after [Entry] interface. Blackout would end for a total period of blackout of about 3 minutes 16 seconds. Seven minutes 44 seconds after Entry the two drogue parachutes should deploy, with the main chutes coming out at 8 minutes 30 seconds, and splashdown approximately at 13 minutes 22 seconds after Entry Interface. Mid-Course Correction 7 will be performed with the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters [and] will require a 7 second pulse of these thrusters, producing a total velocity change of 3.1 feet per second. And the purpose of this Mid-Course Correction is for corridor control, to give the spacecraft the desired entry interface angle of 6 and one half degrees, minus 6 and a half degrees. At the present time Apollo 16 is 104,401 nautical miles from Earth and the spacecraft velocity is up to 5,669 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. Flight Director Don Puddy has been going around the room, checking with each of his Flight Controllers on our status in this point of the mission, and reviewing the upcoming activities on the Flight Plan for this shift. One of the major things that the crew will be doing during this shift will be a series of operations with the Command and Service module and also with the cameras they're carrying, with three of the cameras, to determine what effects such things as water dumps and various attitudes of the spacecraft have on efforts to photograph dim-light phenomena. This is of particular interest to people doing the planning for Skylab. It will affect such things as Mission Planning and Spacecraft Systems Management during Skylab while astronomy operations are going on in an effort to gain some information on the effects as such things as water dumps on the ability to take dim-light photographs, photographs of dim-light phenomena. The crew will be operating with three cameras, the 16 millimeter [Data] Acquisition Camera, the Nikon and the Hasselblad, all using high speed film and taking photographs at various times and in various attitudes from the CSM. At one point during the Skylab Contamination Sequence they will perform a water dump and will attempt to determine what affect the resultant cloud of particles - ice crystals has on their ability to photograph dim-light phenomena, and also how long the cloud requires to disperse. This entire operation is scheduled for about 2 hours 15 minutes on the Flight Plan. Also, one of the activities, again tonight, will be the operation of the Scientific Instrument Module bay equipment, particularly the Gamma Ray, the Alpha Particle and the X-ray Experiments. One of the targets in deep space will be Sco X-1, this is a hot spot of X-Rays in deep space, the X-Ray Spectrometer Experiment will be pointed at this galactic source of X-rays and will be attempting again to gather information which the principal investigator will use to determine the signature of this particular X-ray source.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 270 hours, 5 minutes [245:18]. During our change of shift briefing, we had no conversation with the crew. We'll leave the lines up live from this point on. The next major item on the flight plan has a series of operations known as Skylab contamination photos, the crew as was mentioned previously will be using the 16 millimeter Data Acquisition Camera, the Nikon camera and the Hasselblad camera. In an exercise to determine what effect such things as water vets and various spacecraft attitudes have on the ability to photograph dim light phenomenon, this is of particular interest to Skylab, where quite a bit of astronomical type of experiments and studies will be going on.</p> <a name="245_44_07"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>245 44 07 Mattingly:</b> Don, we're on our way to the Skylab contamination attitude. Is that okay?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>245 44 10 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 09 57 Peterson:</b> 16, Houston. When you get into this maneuver to the second attitude, we'd like to go Mapping Camera door, Open, and a Gainstep up four steps. And then Stu's got some words for you here on the use of EMP 509 for entry.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 10 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Stand by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 10 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you've got the Mapping Camera door Open, and you've got the Gainstep up four steps.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 10 54 Peterson:</b> Roger. Copy.</p> <a name="246_11_23"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 11 23 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We're on our way. How about giving first a couple of philosophy words on 509, and then, if there's something for us to copy, we'll come back and catch it later with our books.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 11 35 Roosa:</b> Okay, Ken. I think we'll not copy anything at this time or make any changes to the Entry Checklist. I would just like to give you a few words on it, let you mull it over. If you have any questions, and then tomorrow morning we'll - we'll make the - the changes. Basically, we're recommending the use of 509 during entry. And, of course, the TVC relay that we've chased around will not be activated during entry. However, all the time there's - there's been this doubt that we can say, specifically, that's the relay. We think it's a high-probability source, however, in lieu of today, in particular. We - we're not sure that - we - we can't rule out that some other EMI might - might glitch that CDU. They've taken a good look - and - look at the wiring in the CDU, and, as it turns out, the 90-degree bit in CDU Z is the most sensitive to being set by EMI. And this bit is wired differently that - than the other bit. So, to preclude going into coarse align, we - we'd like to use 509 for entry. And, of course, this doesn't prevent any glitches, but it does prevent you from locking up the platform with the - with the coarse align: routine. What this is going to ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 13 13 Mattingly:</b> ......</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 13 14 Roosa:</b> ...what this is - Go ahead, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 13 19 Mattingly:</b> I was thinking about the things that happened today. We didn't have to do anything. It didn't lock up anything, and it didn't look like even zeroing the CDUs had any effect on it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 13 32 Roosa:</b> We agree - we agree to that ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 13 33 Mattingly:</b> ...with 509, if we have a glitch, what would - what would you anticipate would be the proper thing to see and the proper response?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 13 42 Roosa:</b> Okay, now. As we've said before, the only thing 509 will do for you is to prevent the CMC from going into the coarse-align routine. If you, indeed, get a glitch, you're going to have the CDU indicating a wrong attitude. This would be reflected, most probably, in your Noun 20s, and you could expect the spacecraft, if you're under CMC control, to try to chase off after this Noun 20. And, if it is the 90-degree bit, you would - the 509 would keep you from going into a coarse align. So, if the spacecraft moves, you would not lose your attitude reference, and you could do a Verb 20, zero the CDUs, and be back in business again. That - that's the only - the only thing that we have to offer on the thing is to try to prevent this coarse align, if you get the 90-degree glitch. Now, if you get a glitch in roll - you could get a glitch in roll or pitch. And, under CMC control, it would see this as a - as a erroneous Noun 20 and do whatever is appropriate. If you're in attitude hold, it's going to try to - try to chase it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 15 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 15 17 Roosa:</b> Okay. And, as I said, let's don't make any changes to the checklist. Let's massage this overnight. But, basically, what you're going to do is continue to use SCS control for your P52s, and then we'll - As we start into our entry program, we'll make one entry as we go into P61, and then 509 protection will be in once average g and P61 comes back up. And then, as you activate the entry DAP, this is going to kill 509, because it - it resets the DAP registers. So after you enter the entry DAP, you're going to have to do your Verb 21 Noun 46 and put - put your three back in R-1 of Noun 46. The procedures look pretty straightforward, Ken. There's - like I say, these two spots where you need to make these entries, they look real straightforward, and it's the same numbers that - that you've been using. And once you have put 509 back in after activation of entry DAP, then it will be in throughout the rest of the entry.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 16 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Sounds like you guys have been working again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 16 52 Roosa:</b> Well, this is (laughter). You know what, this is really chasing a - chasing a spook bit here, but I guess we're probably getting a lot of experts on - on CDUs, and it looks like the - the 509 is - is the way to go. And the question you might have is - well, why didn't we do 509 during the - during the rendezvous if that's what we're concerned about? And there I just didn't want any glitches, and I did want to keep the gimbal lock protection in. Now, something maybe we haven't discussed with you, that if 509 is in and you truly go through your 90 or 270 yaw, you will, most probably, damage the IMU. And you hear the words, "you'll break it," you'll hear the words, "you'll render it unreliable," so forth. So as long as 509 is in, you do not have your true gimbal lock protection because the CMC will never go to coarse align. And I didn't feel it was worth doing that - taking any sort of chance on the platform until we've got down to the entry point, but, once we're here, it's sort of superfluous. If - if you - if you go there, you've lost your reference anyway, no matter what you've done to the - done to the platform, but you should be aware that you have lost this protection.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 18 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Sounds real good, Stu. Thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 18 23 Young:</b> Yeah. Good work, Stu. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 18 27 Roosa:</b> Okay. And, if you don't have any more questions on this, I'll - I'll get off the loop, and we will have these specific changes to the Entry Checklist for you tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 18 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Don't stay up all night.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 18 42 Roosa:</b> No sweat. Don't you either. We'll see you.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 271 hours 6 minutes [246:19]. That was Astronaut Stuart Roosa discussing entry procedures with the crew. Roosa, in particular, has been going through the so-called EMP 509 routine in the simulators here in Houston at the Manned Spacecraft Center. And [he] was discussing what the crew should expect to see using this particular computer routine. In some way the EMP509 is a procedure that was developed earlier in the flight to prevent a coarse alignment of the platform. The stable platform is used as an attitude reference by the spacecraft. Due to what was described as a glitch in one of the - in the Coupling Data Unit in one of the electronics packages in the guidance system which led the guidance system to suspect that the platform had gone out of alignment and activated an automatic procedure which caused the platform to go into coarse alignment even though, in fact, there was no problem. Now when the platform is coarse aligned, this in affect destroys the alignment that is in there, requires the crew going through a rather elaborate procedure to realign the platform. The EMP509 is a procedure developed to bypass this particular glitch. In the event it occurs it is simply ignored.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 20 55 Peterson:</b> 16, your rates look good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 21 05 Young:</b> Roger. The pictures are being snapped.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> And that was John Young reporting pictures being snapped. This is part of the Skylab contamination study. Taking pictures with a variety of cameras on board in a variety of attitudes. And at one point, the crew will be dumping water to determine the effect of a water dump on the ability of photographic equipment to detect low light level astronautical features. This is, as we said before, is in conjunction with a Skylab program, and where we'll be doing quite a bit of astronautical photography and they will be using the ATM - the Apollo Telescope Mount - for astronautical observations. The data that's gained on this mission will be useful in determining how to manage the spacecraft systems during Skylab for minimum interference with the photography and astronomy. Apollo 16 at the present time is 98,128 nautical miles from Earth. Travelling at a speed of 5,898 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 43 18 Peterson:</b> 16, would it help you if we called you to advise you when your rates are sufficiently damped in these different Skylabs.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 45 20 Mattingly:</b> Don, did you call us?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 45 23 Peterson:</b> Yeah, we just wanted to know if we could help you by advising you when your rates are damped, so you wouldn't have to wait for them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 45 33 Mattingly:</b> No, we - we're having to restart the sequence, but we'll get it this time, and we'll be pressing on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 45 37 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 48 48 Young:</b> Houston, when we started the Skylab dump contamination, it didn't - it dumped a little out the side hatch and then it must have flashed - froze - or something, because it stopped immediately. And so Ken is now removing the screw to see if it's - to see if it's still flowing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 49 11 Peterson:</b> Roger. We copy that.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>246 49 31 Young:</b> The heater had been on about - about ten minutes before we started.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 49 43 Peterson:</b> I'm not sure what you mean by it "had been on about ten minutes before you started." You mean the dump had started?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 49 50 Young:</b> Yeah, before we started dumping.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 49 53 Peterson:</b> Okay. The bag had been on before you started dumping.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>246 49 57 Young:</b> No, not the bag, the heater.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>246 50 30 Peterson:</b> And, John, I guess using that heater's about the only thing we know to do. If that doesn't work, we don't have an answer for you.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>247 14 45 Mattingly:</b> What are they?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>247 14 47 Peterson:</b> Okay. We need to close the door on the Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter and on the X-Ray/Alpha Particle, and we need to make about a one-minute water dump. We need to dump five percent. And we need to get the Gainstep up four steps.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>247 15 24 Mattingly:</b> Don, we have another four minutes before we take our last sequence of photos here, and you don't want to take a water dump until we get through with that, do you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>247 15 36 Peterson:</b> Negative. You can hold off until after the photos.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>247 15 41 Mattingly:</b> And we've got the Gainstep set, and we've closed the doors.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 273 hours, 3 minutes [248:16]. We've had the crew stop the Passive Thermal Control, a slow rotation of the spacecraft, because of a cold spot that our Orbital Science officer had been watching in the Scientific Instrument Module Bay. We're going to have them hold in an attitude where the Sun is shining on this bay for about 30 minutes. That should warm it up and at that point we'll have them go back into the Passive Thermal Control mode rotating at about 3 revolutions per hour. The feeling is that at that point the cold area of the SIM bay will get a chance to warm up. In the previous attitude, that area was cold soaking pointed away from the Sun and the Passive Thermal Control was simply not bringing the temperature up as rapidly as OSO, the Orbital Science Officer, would have liked, so we stopped the Passive Thermal Control rotation pointing the SIM bay at the Sun and letting it warm up for about 30 minutes before re-entering the PTC or Passive Thermal Control. Apollo 16 is 91,358 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity is now creeping upward from 6,000 feet per second. We're showing 6,166 feet per second at the present time.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>248 45 43 Duke (onboard):</b> They noticed the cabin go down about a tenth and the O<sub>2</sub> flow come up, and they was wondering if we were doing anything.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 45 48 Peterson:</b> And the High-Gain angles are Pitch 11 and Yaw 330.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 45 56 Young:</b> Roger. Pitch 11; Yaw 330; attitude 278, 295, and 310.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 46 05 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 46 07 Young:</b> Okay. We're going there now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>245 46 09 Peterson:</b> Okay. And we're watching the cabin pressure. It's steady again now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 46 20 Duke:</b> Okay, Pete. It looks about like where it's been to us. We think it's been hanging a little bit below 5 [psi].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 46 30 Peterson:</b> Yeah. That's affirmative, and EECOM says that could be the cabin regs making up that's causing what he's seeing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 46 39 Duke:</b> Okay.
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 46 44 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 46 47 Duke (onboard):</b> I think it's doing it now, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 46 49 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) making up (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 46 51 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 46 54 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, I think while we had that hole open, we saw no increase in O<sub>2</sub> flow and we thought it was very strange at the time. There was no increase at all, and maybe now the cabin regs decided to make it up a little.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 47 12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 47 19 Young (onboard):</b> You want some more, Ken?</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>248 47 48 Duke (onboard):</b> (Garble) 7 (garble) is what I'm telling you. Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 00 Young (onboard):</b> A-7 is a bad compartment to get into.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 03 Duke (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 04 Young (onboard):</b> Okay, it says, "E - E - vacuum cleaner power cable."</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 17 Young (onboard):</b> Man, I sure don't either, come to think of it.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 19 Crew (onboard):</b> (Garble) Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 32 Crew (onboard):</b> You think this is it?</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 39 Young (onboard):</b> I think that's where we put it, as a matter of fact.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 42 Crew (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 46 Young (onboard):</b> That's where we put it. Okay. Let me continue.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>248 48 54 Young (onboard):</b> Okay. EVA- EVA equipment container.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 02 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 03 Young (onboard):</b> Pressure control valve.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 05 Mattingly (onboard):</b> All that equipment (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 06 Duke (onboard):</b> All that's there.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 08 Young (onboard):</b> And it's in A-7, right?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 09 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yep.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 10 Young (onboard):</b> We already checked that yesterday. EV gloves and wrist tether in accessory bag - for the CMP is in there, right?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 17 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) one (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 22 Young (onboard):</b> Where are they going to go?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 24 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) tunnel.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 27 Duke (onboard):</b> They're up in the tunnel, I think, Ken.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 49 53 Duke (onboard):</b> You want to put this up there, John? Let's turn it around.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 00 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 02 Duke (onboard):</b> That's the wrong one. I should have known.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 50 07 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. You want us to dump the OPS again? We would like to finally stow it, and we can dump it now if you want.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 50 15 Peterson:</b> Okay. We would like to use the OPS to get the cabin up to 5.6, and then leave it in bleed flow thorough the sleep period.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 50 26 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 XX Duke (onboard):</b> Dump the OPS, Ken, up to - to get the cabin up to 5.6 and then leave it in bleed flow.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 35 Young (onboard):</b> Whatever that means.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 37 Duke (onboard):</b> I don't know how you do that.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 39 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 41 Young (onboard):</b> I would think.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 44 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 50 46 Young (onboard):</b> I don't know. I think that's how it is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 50 53 Young:</b> That bleed flow means leaving the hose in the port and leave it on, right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 51 00 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute, John. I'll check</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 51 23 Duke (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 51 41 Young (onboard):</b> How much is in there, Ken?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 51 43 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) on the (Garble).</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 51 42 Peterson:</b> 16, we need you to check that dump in the hatch where you just made the Skylab dump from. We're still showing a little high on the 0<sub>2</sub> flow.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 51 54 Young (onboard):</b> Well, we checked it. It's all closed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 51 58 Duke:</b> Flow just went to 0.2 here, Pete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 52 02 Peterson:</b> Yeah. Roger. EECOM's just calling it. We're seeing it drop off here now.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 52 09 Young (onboard):</b> Dingalings.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 52 17 Duke (onboard):</b> That sure looks tight. I guess I could switch to (Garble).</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 52 19 Peterson:</b> Okay. On the OPS configuration, we wanted the OPS connector locked in the stowage plate, and turn the OPS Actuator to On.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 52 30 Young (onboard):</b> I understand.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 52 31 Duke (onboard):</b> It is 5.2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 52 33 Peterson:</b> That's after you dump the cabin up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 52 38 Young:</b> Okay. That's what we'll do</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 53 31 Duke (onboard):</b> How did I get so tangled up here?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 53 34 Young (onboard):</b> Charlie, how did you get so tangled up there? (Laughter) 5 - 5.3, Ken. I don't think it's going to get up there. What's - what's on the - what's ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 53 47 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 53 50 Young (onboard):</b> Well, that's what they said.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 53 52 Duke (onboard):</b> No, they didn't say that. They said they had it ...</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 53 55 Young (onboard):</b> They said they wanted us to check and make sure we closed the port. Not only did he close it, he sealed it with a kiss. Right?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 54 15 Duke (onboard):</b> If that's all the leak is, we got it made.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 54 18 Young (onboard):</b> Right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 54 19 Peterson:</b> 16, on the High Gain, I think the angles we called up are wrong. Let's go Pitch 55, Yaw 323.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 54 30 Young (onboard):</b> Did you get those angles?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 54 31 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah, I got them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 54 42 Young:</b> Okay. We're at the Sco X-1 attitude, as you know.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 54 46 Peterson:</b> Roger. And go Wide on the High Gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 55 04 Duke:</b> Pete, it doesn't seem to be acquiring in Reacq. I stepped it through.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 55 14 Peterson:</b> Okay. And Charlie, did you copy to try 55 degrees on Pitch and 323 on Yaw? And the first set of angles we called up were not correct.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 55 24 Duke:</b> Okay. My mistake.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 55 49 Peterson:</b> No, Charlie. That was our mistake. The first set of angles we called up were wrong.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 55 56 Duke:</b> Okay. 55 and 323.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 55 58 Peterson:</b> Affirmative.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 56 00 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Garble) put it on the eight ball and (garble) let it (Garble).</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>248 56 09 Young (onboard):</b> Okay. That's reading to ...</p>
      <p class="ed">[End of CM transcript.]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 56 18 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. We got it turned on. It's got about 200 pounds in it; it's just barely making any noise.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 56 25 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 57 02 Peterson:</b> And 16, would you give us Gamma Ray Shield, Off, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 57 07 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 57 24 Peterson:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 59 03 Peterson:</b> 16, with the OPS flow, we're still looking at an O<sub>2</sub> flow that is higher than normal. And we'd like you to take a look at the nozzle on the hatch window there and make sure that - on the hatch there and make sure that it's secured.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 59 50 Duke:</b> Okay, Pete. We'll reinstall it. I got the cover hand - tight as I can get it, and we'll take the cover off and reinstall the nozzle.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>248 59 59 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 03 24 Peterson:</b> Okay? Charlie. Looks like the O<sub>2</sub> flow is down to about what we'd expect now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 03 31 Duke:</b> Okay, Pete. We're cleaning off the suit return hoses and the inlet to the suits circuit.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 03 48 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 05 47 Peterson:</b> 16, would you verify the H<sub>2</sub> Tanks 1 and 2 Fans Off, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 05 54 Duke:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 05 56 Peterson:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 11 35 Peterson:</b> 16, we need the X-Ray Off for two seconds and then back On. We're trying to keep it out of the attenuate mode for the next few minutes here. </p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 274 hours, 5 minutes [249:18]. The crew aboard Apollo 16 at the present time is primarily involved in operating the SIM bay instruments, the Gamma Ray, Alpha Particle and X-Ray Spectrometer. They also have an eat period coming up at about this time. And we plan to put them to bed [at] 276 hours [251:13] or about 2 hours from now. We've had relatively little conversation with the crew; one of the last items discussed was fluctuating cabin oxygen pressure, it turned out that this fluctuation was caused by apparently dirty screens on a cabin inlet outlet vents for the oxygen flow and once the crew cleaned these off which is a normal procedure the flow rate settled down to a steady level. Also we've discussed with them the OPS pressure, this is the Oxygen Purge System, one of two emergency units carried by the two crewmen on the lunar surface on top of their Portable Life Support Systems. These are available to provide emergency oxygen and cooling, on the lunar surface. One of these OPS units is carried back into the Command Module following the lunar surface activities and is available for any contingency during the Command Module EVA. That now behind us, it's desirable to get the OPS which starts out with a very high pressure, somewhere around 5,900 pounds per square inch on the lunar surface, bled down to virtually nothing at entry. The OPS has been used for the last couple of nights to pump up the cabin, prior to the crew sleep for they pressurize the cabin, let the pressure up and let it gradually decay down from the normal level, by the time they awake, using the OPS provides this surge of oxygen rapidly bleeds its pressure down. It's down now to about 200 pounds per square inch and the crew is allowing the remaining approximately one quarter of a pound of oxygen that remains in the bottle to bleed off. We expect that it will be down very close to zero, if not at zero, by the time the spacecraft re-enters tomorrow. And we're now showing entry 16 hours, 16 minutes away; splashdown 16 hours, 29 minutes from now. Apollo 16 at the present time is 87,550 nautical miles from Earth travelling at a speed of 6,329 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 19 40 Peterson:</b> 16, would you verify that the X-Ray/Alpha Cover is Open, 16?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 19 50 Duke:</b> We got it closed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 19 54 Peterson:</b> Okay. Would you open it, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 19 56 Duke:</b> It's open now, Pete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 19 58 Peterson:</b> Roger. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 27 19 Peterson:</b> 16, we're asking for some stuff that's at 273:50 [249:03] in the Flight Plan. We need a report on the Command Module RCS injector valve temps.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 27 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It's in work.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 27 49 Peterson:</b> Okay. Do you want me to give you a call out on the systems test meter positions or not?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 27 55 Young:</b> No, we can figure that out, probably.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 28 13 Duke:</b> Pete, 5 Charlie is 4.3; 5 Delta is 4.6; 6 Alpha is 4.2; 6 Bravo is 4.4; 6 Charlie is greater than 5; and 6 Delta is 4.4.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 28 44 Peterson:</b> Roger. Copy. And also, we'd like to remind you of a LiOH canister change, 23 in the Bravo and Stow 21 in A-5.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 28 58 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 30 50 Peterson:</b> 16, we need the Gamma Ray, Shield; On.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 30 59 Duke:</b> Okay. You have it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 31 02 Peterson:</b> Roger. Thank you. And, Charlie, you let us know when you get the LiOH canister changed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 31 12 Duke:</b> Being done right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 31 14 Peterson:</b> Roger. And 16, we've got a new attitude for you. The angles are 164, 134, 035. High Gain angles, Pitch minus 23, yaw 101.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 31 41 Mattingly:</b> We got it, Pete. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 31 50 Duke:</b> Okay. The LiOH canister's changed.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 31 53 Peterson:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 39 16 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. Let's try to bring the High Gain up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 57 30 Peterson:</b> And 16, I'm still sitting here with about six items, a couple of which require readings. Most of them just require a little talking. Anytime you can get to it - well, let's get started on it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 57 42 Duke:</b> Okay. Just as soon as we get Ken on comm.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>249 57 45 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 01 03 Mattingly:</b> Hello, Houston.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 01 05 Peterson:</b> Go ahead, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 01 08 Mattingly:</b> Understand you have a few words.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 01 10 Peterson:</b> Roger. First of all, I guess we wanted to check with you on any changes to entry stowage, and particularly the LiOH canisters, to check that they are stowed according to the entry stowage list.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 01 26 Mattingly:</b> LiOH canisters are stowed according to the entry stowage list, and the entry stowage is essentially complete except for the items that we need to work out tomorrow. And, of course, tying down the suit under the right-hand seat.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 01 46 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 01 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. There's a couple of things that we couldn't stow as per nominal. They are the fecal bag and the goodie bag. And we intend to tie those down in the LEB. The goodie bag is the IN Data File. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 02 07 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand IN data file and the fecal bag are gonna be tied down in the LEB.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 02 12 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. And we know we can tie those down enough to withstand any kind of re-entry. You might even help L-over-D. I don't - You know how much the IN Flight Data File weighs? Less the Contingency Checklist and the Timeline Book. And that's a total - mostly the total weight of that bag.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 02 31 Peterson:</b> Roger. Okay. We - we also need the battery compartment reading one more time before you go to bed tonight. And I guess if you want to, we could get that out of the way now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 02 49 Mattingly:</b> 2.75.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 02 50 Peterson:</b> Understand, 2.75.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 02 55 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 03 09 Peterson:</b> Okay. And, Charlie, we want you on the biomed tonight. And it looks like we're gonna have to reverse the top two sensor wires, because apparently - either you got them hooked up backwards, or we're getting the signal turned around somewhere in the transmission.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 03 32 Peterson:</b> Charlie, that's - we want to reverse ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 03 34 Duke:</b> Yeah, is the lon - The long one's the ground, isn't it?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 03 39 Peterson:</b> Negative. Stand by just a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 03 55 Peterson:</b> Okay, Charlie. The long one goes to the sternum, and the branching one goes off to the right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 04 11 Duke:</b> Well, I got them on like I been wearing them all week.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 04 20 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 04 31 Peterson:</b> Okay. And the surgeons wanted you to know they appreciated your status - the good status report you gave them this morning. And they hope you can find time to give them a good one again tomorrow morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 05 05 Peterson:</b> Okay. We got one other item. We just want to make sure that we don't get any uncoupled attitude control after 277 hours [252:13] GET. That's to ensure that we get precise tracking for at least 10 hours prior to Mid-Course 7.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 05 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm as interested in that as you are.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 05 34 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 05 51 Peterson:</b> Okay. And I guess we've got some news items here for you. And I think that'll wrap it up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 06 01 Young:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p> <a name="250_06_04"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 06 04 Peterson:</b> Okay. I guess the biggest news was that President Nixon went on national television tonight to discuss the military situation in Vietnam. He said efforts toward Vietnamization of the war were proving effective. And he announced additional US troop withdrawals of 20,000 men by July the first. At the same time, the President characterized the current North Vietnamese advances into South Vietnam as an open invasion. And he said US air and naval forces will continue to attack military targets in North Vietnam to assure the safety of remaining US forces in South Vietnam and to prevent a military takeover of South Vietnam by the North. The President also said US negotiators would return to the Paris peace talks, as he put it, "To get on with the constructive business of obtaining peace." "The first order of business," he said, "will be to get the North Vietnamese to stop their invasion and to secure the release of Americans being held prisoner." And we got an item here on Apollo 16. The headline says, "Spaceship Speeds Up, Zeros in on Earth." Apollo 16 picked up speed today from the gravitational embrace of Earth as scientists awaited the delivery of samples that may rewrite the history of the Moon. Astronauts John Young, Charles Duke, and Thomas Mattingly II, were due to enter the atmosphere of Earth, Thursday afternoon, at 24,000 miles per hour. Apollo 16 is returning 240 pounds of Moon samples. But the flight's lunar legacy consists of more than just rocks. Mattingly spent an hour walking in space Tuesday to retrieve two holders containing the exposed film of powerful mapping and panoramic cameras. With only one mission remaining in the Apollo Program, the cameras' pictures, taken from lunar orbit, are expected to provide much knowledge about areas of the Moon that man will not visit for a long time. And a little - little bit on the Democratic campaign here. "Muskie dealt 1-2 blow by McGovern in Massachusetts and HHH in Pennsylvania. Senator George McGovern, triumphant in Massachusetts, and Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, the Pennsylvania victor, joined head-on political battle today after dealing a 1-2 blow to the Presidential campaign of Senator Edmund Muskie. Muskie finished a far-back second in Massachusetts, and managed only a virtual third-place tie with McGovern and Wallace in Pennsylvania where he concentrated his campaign. Alabama Governor George C. Wallace got 21 percent with 97 percent of the precincts tallied in Pennsylvania, after staging a 1-day campaign. Massachusetts gave Wallace 8 percent of the vote in partial returns, just ahead of Humphrey. Next Tuesday McGovern and Humphrey confront each other, Muskie, and Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington in Ohio battle for 153 convention delegates." A couple of items on - on the re-entry area. The USS Ticonderoga, the primary recovery ship for Apollo 16, has arrived at the new splashdown site, 1,500 miles south of Honolulu. The forecast for Thursday splash was unlimited visibility with temperatures in the 80s. Seas are expected to be one to three feet with swells to five feet. And the weather here in Houston is low tonight in the low 60s, high Thursday in the low 80s, and the weather's been clear to partly cloudy today. And the Houston Astros did it again. They won their eighth consecutive baseball victory last night, a hard-fought 5 to 4 verdict over the Chicago Cubs. The win kept Houston in a tie with Los Angeles for first place in the National League West. And let's see, I guess we'll close ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 09 57 Duke:</b> ...Go get 'em. It's a big "Atta boy" for the Astros.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 10 01 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 10 15 Peterson:</b> And we got one last item here, which is entitled "Slick Trick by an Eager Beaver" from Flint, Michigan. Dedication to duty is fine, say Flint city officials, but the man who turned several miles of city streets into an ice rink carried that concept too far. He had been told to use the city water truck to wash the streets Tuesday morning. He did. Dutifully ignoring the three degrees below freezing temperature. His trail was clearly marked by irate drivers trying to navigate their dented cars over the glassy surface. Officials said salt crews were dispatched, but the Sun came out and melted the problem before they did. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 11 06 Duke:</b> Thanks a lot, Pete. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 11 08 Peterson:</b> You bet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 11 09 Young:</b> Yeah. That's the way - that's the way the Rover drives. Like it's on ice.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 11 14 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 11 25 Mattingly:</b> We appreciate that good news, Pete.</p>

      <p class="pao"> <b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 275 hours, 19 minutes [250:32], and we've heard relatively little from the crew for the last 30 minutes or so. Earlier this evening they've been involved in getting everything stowed and ready for the entry and splashdown tomorrow, which is now some 15 hours, 17 minutes away. They also have a number of the instruments in the Scientific Instrument Module bay in operation - the Gamma Ray, Alpha Particle and X-ray sensors. And they should be in the midst of an eat period, getting their dinner prior to retiring for what will be their last night of sleep aboard Casper. We do have one more midcourse correction planned prior to entry into Earth's atmosphere. That will be midcourse correction number 7 which occurs at 287 hours, 22 minutes, 56 seconds [262:36:54]. This will be a 7-second burn of the Reaction Control System thrusters to produce a change in velocity of about 3.1 feet per second []. The purpose of this maneuver is to drop the angle of Entry Interface, the angle at which the spacecraft enters below the horizontal, from its current value of negative 6.15 degrees to the nominal of about 6 and [a] half. Splashdown is scheduled to occur at - rather entry is scheduled to occur at 290 hours 23 minutes [and] 32 seconds [265:37:30] with splashdown about 13 minutes, 22 seconds following entry into Earth's atmosphere. At the present time Apollo 16 is 82,900 nautical miles from Earth, travelling at a speed of some 6,500 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 45 30 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 45 33 Peterson:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 45 37 Mattingly:</b> What would you folks think about my going to whatever attitude I'm going to do PTC in tonight and get it all damped and ready to set up? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 45 45 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 45 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 46 25 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. You can go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 46 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay; and that's a Pitch of 43 and Yaw of 335. Is that affirm?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 46 38 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 46 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay, sir. And this PTC will be a normal PTC with no engines enable. Correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 46 50 Peterson:</b> I believe that's right, Ken. Stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 46 59 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 47 01 Peterson:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 47 03 Duke:</b> Okay; it looks like we've got a H<sub>2</sub> Tank 1 that's a little above the green line - about 270. Oh that's - Excuse me; that's the one with the sen - bad sensor. Excuse me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 47 17 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 47 28 Peterson:</b> And, Ken, that is a normal PTC.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 47 32 Mattingly:</b> Thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 47 49 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. And in connection with that, we want to verify that the Pitch is minus 40, Yaw is 90 on the High Gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 47 59 Mattingly:</b> That's verified.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 48 02 Peterson:</b> And ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 48 03 Duke:</b> And, Pete, I was ready to sack out. Did y'all come to any conclusion about this biomed?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 48 13 Peterson:</b> Charlie, you can leave it just like it is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 48 16 Duke:</b> Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 48 18 Peterson:</b> And one other item we need, I guess, is a readout on Battery C and Pyro Batteries A and B voltage. This will be the last chance we'll get to look at them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 48 29 Duke:</b> Okay; stand by. Battery C is 36&frac12;. The Pyro Bats are both 36&frac12;.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 48 40 Peterson:</b> Roger; copy. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 49 15 Peterson:</b> Okay. And, Ken, we need an E-MOD, and we're ready to call it a night.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 49 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess - I guess I could do that while we're doing the maneuver.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 59 28 Mattingly:</b> Don, I've got one more question for you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 59 31 Peterson:</b> Okay; go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>250 59 36 Mattingly:</b> When it comes time to change REFSMMATs, to go to the entry REFSMMAT tomorrow, I've been thinking about our - our funnies that we've seen with the CDUs, and when we were looking at that one this afternoon, it in - in some ways hinted that maybe we - maybe we didn't have all that D to A and A to D stuff working the way it ought to. Would there be any advantage of - Maybe someone could think about it tonight, maybe they already are - but is there any advantage to doing a pulse torque to change REFSMMATs tomorrow instead of by the usual procedure of using the coarse align.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 00 25 Peterson:</b> Okay. I understand what you're asking. Stand by just a minute. Okay. Ken, we'll work on that and get back to you first thing in the morning with it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 00 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I don't have any strong druthers. I just - I was thinking over the things we might be going through and kind of wondered if that might be prudent if I avoided that loop. But if everybody's happy with it, it's certainly a lot easier to coarse align.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 00 57 Peterson:</b> Okay. We'll take a good close look at it tonight and let you know in the morning first thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 01 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 01 06 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 276 hours, 2 minutes [251:15]. For the past two hours or so the Apollo 16 crew has been busily storing things. Getting things ship shape aboard Apollo 16 and ready for tomorrow's entry and splashdown. They have just about completed that and have wrapped up all their flight plan activities prior to beginning the sleep period. They're now getting the spacecraft stabilized and ready to...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 06 54 Mattingly:</b> Don, we'll be off comm for about three or four minutes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 06 58 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 16 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Don, I'm back up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 16 50 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 16 53 Mattingly:</b> Do the rates look reasonable for PTC? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 16 55 Peterson:</b> Roger. The rates look real good. You can go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 16 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We'll see what happens.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> And from our telemetry indications here on the ground we can see that Ken Mattingly is now starting to spin the spacecraft up. It'll be rotated at about three revolutions per hour which is normal mode for sleep where the spacecraft is exposed equally on all sides to sunlight and alternately to the black cold of space. This maintains the proper temperature equilibrium. Apollo 16 at this time is 80,305 nautical miles from Earth. And the spacecraft velocity is 6,667 feet per second.
      <p class="tech"><b>251 27 29 Mattingly:</b> Don, we're about ready to sign off. Is there anything else that you'd like to do tonight? Anything we have out of configuration that you're aware of?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 27 37 Peterson:</b> I don't think so, Ken, but stand by one minute. Okay. Ken, we're all squared away. Get a good sleep. We'll see you in the morning.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 27 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you very much. Good night.</p> <a name="251_27_53"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>251 27 53 Peterson:</b> Night.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 276 hours, 38 minutes [251:51]. We said goodnight to the crew aboard Apollo 16 nearly 25 minutes ago and they're scheduled to sleep for some eight hours. At about 12:30 Houston time the INCO, Instrumentation and Communications Officer, here in the Control Center plans once again to activate the television camera aboard the Lunar Roving Vehicle at the Descartes landing site and move it around via the remote control setup here in the Control Center to look at various features at the landing site. The terrain around the landing site hills and interesting rocks. The camera lens did get a fairly good dusting when the lunar module lifted off and we don't expect to find the camera very useful for looking at astronomical objects such as the Milky Way and Magellanic clouds. These were some of the items that had been considered as possible targets for post liftoff TV however, the television picture is apparently not useful for such difficult to see under the best of conditions astronomical objects. We will not have a change of shift briefing during this - at the end of this shift. In Mission Control right now, we're in the process of handing over Flight Director Gerry Griffin and the Gold team coming on to replace Flight Director Don Puddy and the Orange Team of Flight Controllers, the Spacecraft Communicator on the upcoming shift is Astronaut Tony England. Apollo 16 now 13 hours, 57 minutes away from splashdown.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; 276 hours, 52 minutes [252:05] Ground Elapsed Time in the mission of Apollo 16. Streaking homeward at 6,828 feet per second, now 77,139 nautical miles out from Earth, the crew is asleep at this time, having signed off about a half hour ago and turned off their voice downlink. Splashdown 13 hours, 43 minutes away. We'll take down the air-to-ground circuit at this time. Should the crew awake and commence talking again, we'll bring it up. At 276:53 [252:06], this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control; 278 hours, 47 minutes [254:00] into the Mission of Apollo 16. Some 11 hours, 49 minutes away from splashdown in the Central Pacific. A short while ago the ground commanded television assembly at - still on the Rover at the Descartes landing site - was activated - panned around looking at the landing site and the artifacts left there by the Apollo 16 crew. The Lunar Module Descent Stage looking rather like a dead spider sitting in the foreground. Crew's still asleep at this time, probably be awakened around 8 am Central Time. Spacecraft nearing the Earth and now 69,310 miles out. Velocity continuing to build up now 7,267 feet per second. In some 11 hours, 34 minutes as the spacecraft encounters the atmosphere at 400,000 feet, that velocity will have built up to 36,196 feet per second. Flight path angle for entry still showing on the display as minus 6.15 degrees, relative to the local horizontal at the landing - at the splashdown point or entry interface point. At 278:49 [254:01] this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, [at a] Ground Elapsed Time of 279:47 [255:00], 2:55 AM Central Standard Time. Apollo 16 presently 65,141 nautical miles out from the Earth, approaching at a velocity of 7,529 feet per second. Apollo 16 crew asleep; no words since their last sign-off at about 11:30pm last evening. They have slightly over four hours remaining in their scheduled sleep period, which will end at a Ground Elapsed Time of 284 hours [259:13]. Splashdown is some 10 hours, 48 minutes away in the south central Pacific. Weather in the landing site, clouds at 2,000 feet scattered, 10 knots, visibility 10 nautical miles, wind out of the east at 10 knots, wave height 3 feet. [USS] Ticonderoga nearing the splashdown point. And at 279:48 [255:01] this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, 281 hours 47 minutes [257:00] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 crew still asleep, with some 2 hours, 12 minutes until reveille on their final night's sleep on their homeward journey from the Moon, only 56,186 miles out. A quarter million mile journey back from the Earth's satellite. Velocity continuing to build up as the gravitational pull of Mother Earth gets stronger. Velocity now 8,173 feet per second, cabin temperature [sic] aboard the Command Module holding at 4.9 pounds per square inch, cabin temperature as shown by telemetry reading 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Data - biomedical data- coming down from the spacecraft is available only on the Lunar Module Pilot, with his heart rate in the upper 30's and 40's - low 40's, his mean heart rate. Splashdown in 8 hours, 47 minutes from now in the South Central Pacific. Recovery force on station, the prime recovery vessel, USS Ticonderoga. At 281:49 [257:02], this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 282 hours and 47 minutes [258:00] Ground Elapsed Time. Seven minutes - as you were - 7 hours, 49 minutes until Apollo 16 splashes down in the Central Pacific some 1,300 miles south of Hawaii. Only 12 minutes remaining in the crew's rest period. Spacecraft now 51,330 nautical away from Earth; velocity, 8,504 feet per second. Down track on this particular entry will be running almost to the due north as the spacecraft makes its final plunge into the atmosphere. Inclination of some 70 degrees whereas the limits in earlier missions have been more like 40 degrees. They are apparently sleeping soundly at this time. There's been no contact with the crew by voice for more than 6 hours. And looking good for tomorrow - this afternoons entry and splashdown and at 282:49 [258:02], this is Apollo Control.</p> <a name="258_00"></a>
