    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer</b> This is Apollo Control. [The] Apollo 16 spacecraft has passed behind the Moon two seconds early according to the Loss of Signal clock in the Control Center here. To review some of the upcoming numbers with the Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver, ignition time will be at 74:28 - 74 hours, 28 minutes, 27 seconds Ground Elapsed Time - about ten minutes from now. The total Delta-V, or velocity change, will be 2,802 feet [854 metres] per seconds - feet per second in retrograde. Apollo 16, at the end of the burn will be in a lunar orbit measuring 58.3 nautical miles pericynthion [108 kilometres] and 170 nautical miles [315 kilometres] in apocynthion. Total burn time with the 2,000 pound thrust - 20,000 pound [89,000 Newtons] thrust Service Propulsion System engine will be six minutes, 14 seconds. With a successful Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, the spacecraft will be acquired again by the Manned Spaceflight Tracking Network at a Ground Elapsed Time of 74 hours, 50 minutes, 5 seconds, but in the remote chance that there is not a burn - no ignition for some reason - the time without a burn would be 74 hours, 42 minutes, eight seconds. The estimated impact time for the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V, which propelled Apollo 16 on the way to the Moon. That impact time now is 75 hours, 7 [minutes], 3 [seconds] and because of no tracking available over the last day or two, this is an estimate based on last predictions. It will not be within the field of view of the spacecraft even though they will be coming around the front side of the Moon at that time; it will be over the spacecraft's horizon. The seismometers from the earlier Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages left on the Moon by earlier missions will be monitored to detect the S-IVB impact, which is equivalent to about 11 tons of TNT. Some 29 minutes away from Acquisition Of Signal - assuming a nominal Lunar Orbit Insertion burn, and 17 seconds away from ignition on Lunar Orbit Insertion. Come back up again prior to AOS, or acquisition of Apollo 16, as it comes around the east side of the Moon. And at 74:21 Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control. </p>

That would be at a Ground Elapsed Time of 74 hours, 42 minutes, 8 seconds. However, if for some reason, the burn is not successful or we have no ignition on the Service Propulsion System engine, the spacecraft will reappear much sooner at about eight minutes from now, or at Ground Elapsed Time of 74 hours, 50 minutes, 5 seconds.

The Flight Dynamics Officer here in [the] Control Center is presently working up the final set of numbers for that burn. They will be performed with the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine, at approximately 78 hours, 35 minutes this will be a 24.1 second burn and will be targeted to place the spacecraft in an orbit of about 59 by 11 nautical miles [109 by 20 kilometres]. We expect we'll have the final numbers for that maneuver in about 15 minutes. At the present time we show Apollo 16 in an orbit of approximately 170 by 58 nautical miles [315 by 107 kilometres] and we've just had the call [of] acquisition of signal so we'll stand by for a call to the crew. </p>

    <p class="tech"><b>077 18 28 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, we were just talking about that, Charlie. Apparently, we had a real nominal burn. Our data down here showed a burn time of six minutes, 14.2 seconds, which is right on the money. And I got a few words on that PC drop. I understand that's completely normal for the first dual-bank burn, due to some helium bubbles that are normally trapped between the ball valves. So that wasn't unexpected for the first dual-bank burn - you shouldn't see it again. And as far as the SPS pressure lights that came on, we warned you earlier to expect that, due to the pressure surge of the tanks pressurizing, we - you were right on the 200-psi limit - that triggered it. The second pressure light you got, which is apparently still on, is due to heat soak back into the tank. So it's not unexpected either. </p>

And it sure looks right now the material that is just to the north of the crater Descartes and that stuff that we talked about going between Delambre B and Descartes A are in fact extensions of the things that go into the Smoky end Stone Mountains.

    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer</b> This is Apollo Control at 77 hours, 54 minutes. During the last few minutes among the sets of numbers passed up to the crew by CAPCOM Hank Hartsfield, were those they will use in performing the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver, and that burn is to occur at 78 hours; 33 minutes; 44 seconds. The maneuver will be performed using the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine. It will be primarily a retrograde burn resulting in slowing the spacecraft by about 203.8 feet [62.1 metres] per second or about 136 miles [219 kilometres] per hour. And as a result of that, we expect the orbit to be changed to 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 kilometres]. This is the orbit from which the spacecraft will begin the Powered Descent to the lunar surface on the 13th revolution. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 55 21 Mattingly:</b> Houston, do you want to take a look at our rotated vector in P40 before we start our maneuver?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 55 27 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Stand by.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 56 39 Hartsfield:</b> Your P30 looked good, Ken.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 56 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The question was, do you want to take a look at the rotated vector in P40 before we start our maneuver, or can we go ahead and start the maneuver?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 57 20 Young:</b> Houston, did you miss the question?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 57 25 Hartsfield:</b> Negative, but we're having trouble finding an answer.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 57 30 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 57 48 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. Go ahead and call P40, then maneuver.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 58 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Have you got enough look now?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>077 58 19 Hartsfield:</b> He's looking at it now, Ken.</p>

    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer</b> This is Apollo Control at 78 hours, 2 minutes. At the present time the Apollo 16 crew is in the process of putting the spacecraft in its proper attitude for the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. That burn is to be performed in 31 minutes, 30 seconds with the spacecraft out of radio contact on the backside of the Moon. We have about 21 minutes remaining before we lose radio contact and in that amount of time we'll be monitoring spacecraft systems, Flight Dynamics Officer will be taking a last look at all of the numbers passed up to the crew to assure that the burn is the precise maneuver that we want to perform. Based on the numbers provided and which are entered in the computer on board that burn will be 24.2 seconds in duration and targeted to give us an orbit of 58.5 by 10.3 nautical miles [108.3 by 19.1 kilometres]. The current orbit is 169.9 by 58.1 [314.6 by 107.6 kilometres]. </p>
    <p class="tech"><b>078 06 31 Hartsfield:</b> 16, give us Omni Delta.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>078 06 42 Young:</b> Okay, you got it?</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>078 06 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer</b> this is Apollo Control, Flight Director Pete Frank has just gone around the room polling each of the flight controllers here, getting a status for the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. All the lights came up green, every one says we're go and we'll be passing that go up to the crew shortly. </p> <a name="078_09_49"></a>
    <p class="tech"><b>078 09 49 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. Everything looks good down here. You've got a Go for DOI, and the monitoring limits in the Flight Plan are good.</p>
    <p class="tech"><b>078 10 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer</b> This is Apollo Control, we're coming up now on nine minutes until loss of contact with Apollo 16. About 19½ minutes away from the time the crew will be performing the descent orbit insertion maneuver. This maneuver of course performed behind the Moon we'll be out of radio contact and we'll get our first look at the results of that maneuver when they come back around on the other side of the Moon on their third revolution, this burn is a very critical maneuver which must be performed in very pre--within very precise limits and particularly in the shutdown which the computer will signal. An overburn of slightly more than one second would place the spacecraft out of trajectory which would impact the Moon if it were not corrected. The normal procedure that the crew would follow in the event that they do get an over-burn is to take out the over burn by using the Reaction Control System thrusters. We'll get about ten minutes of tracking as they come around the front side of the Moon on their third revolution and based on this information we'll give them a go no-go to stay in the trajectory resulting from the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. If we don't like the looks of the trajectory based on ground tracking they'll be told to perform the bailout burn. And that maneuver is scheduled at 79 hours, 22 minutes, eight seconds in the Flight Plan if it is required and would place the spacecraft in a safe 62 by--62.6 by 5.3 nautical mile orbit, again this is a contingency procedure only, and would be used only for some reason the descent orbit insertion maneuver was not as planned and the spacecraft was determined to be in an unsafe orbit. The Guidance Officer has just reported that the crew has switched to Program 40, the program that they will use prior to performing the Descent Orbit Insertion maneuver. And everything continues to progress very smoothly. </p>
