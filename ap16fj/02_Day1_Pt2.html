      <p class="ed">[The Apollo 16 spacecraft, together with the S-IVB third-stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle, is now in orbit around the Earth. Over the next two and a half hours, John Young, Charlie Duke and Ken Mattingly will check out the spacecraft systems and arrange their equipment in the Command Module (CM) which is to be their home for the next two weeks (except while John Young and Charlie Duke are in the Lunar Module and on the lunar surface). Their work is guided by the <a href="csmlc/csmlc.html">Launch Checklist</a>, but they have plenty of time to discuss their work.&nbsp; To help readers find the more significant parts, the following is a short index of the main events.</p>

      <p class="ed">[The crew are just coming into darkness over Africa on their first orbit. They are in contact with Mission Control in Houston through the tracking station in the Canary Islands. The parking orbit around Earth does not permit continuous communication with Mission Control. Indeed, the orbit is so low that when the spacecraft does come within range of a station, it is only above the horizon for a few minutes, even if it passes directly overhead. If it passes to one side or the other, the period of contact is further constrained; for this pass over the Canary Islands tracking station, communication lasts only four minutes.

      <p class="ed">[The crew has been wearing their spacesuits, including their helmets and gloves, since several hours before launch.&nbsp; Now that they are in orbit, the mission rules permit them to remove the helmets and gloves.&nbsp; They will not remove the rest of the suits until after the separation of the Lunar Module from the S-IVB during Translunar Coast.] </p>

      <p class="ed">[The crew has a small tool set to help with a number of task on the spacecraft, stowed in a fabric pouch. These include an emergency wrench, an adjustable wrench (spanner), a ratchet wrench, and a selection of sockets, screw driver and torque bits to fit various fasteners.&nbsp; Most are modified off-the-shelf tools.&nbsp; Tool E is a adapter handle that, as well as fitting most of the specialist bits, can also be used by itself. As it is the most commonly used of the tools in the spacecraft, two are carried.</p> <img src="pics/cm_tools2.gif" title="" alt="Picture of CM Toolkit" style="width: 580px; height: 447px;">] <p class="ob"><b>000 23 14 Young (onboard):</b> I don't even know - I know - What am I kicking?</p>

      <p class="ed">[Numerous items of personal and spacecraft equipment are stowed in compartments, lockers and bags throughout the Command Module (CM).&nbsp; Stowage compartments are part of the cabin structure and most of the equipment stowed in them is in cushioned bags.&nbsp; The lockers are pre-packed before the mission and are attached to the aft bulkhead and equipment bays a short time before launch.&nbsp; This allows groundcrew to gain access to the aft bulkhead during the pre-flight preparation of the spacecraft. Both compartment and locker doors have squeeze-type latches that can be operated with one hand.&nbsp; The compartments and lockers are labelled on the doors for identification and to aid location. They are numbered consecutively from fore to aft and are prefixed with a letter to indicate which equipment bay they are in.Lower equipment bay compartments are B1 to B8, the right hand equipment bay ones are R1 to R13 and the left hand equipment bay ones L2 and L3.&nbsp; The aft bulkhead has lockers A1 to A8 while the upperequipment bay as lockers and bags U1 to U4.&nbsp; There are two expandable temporary stowage containers under the left and right-hand forward equipment bays, designated F1 and F2.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[The various stowage locations have to prevent the items they contain from coming adrift in zero g, and <img style="width: 278px; height: 431px;" alt="Image of stowage U1" title="" src="pics/cm_stowage_u1.gif" align="right">during in-flight manoeuvres.&nbsp; They must also retain the items during the forces imposed during launch and landing.&nbsp; The contents of each bay are supposed to be detailed in planning documents.&nbsp; However, there are almost always changes just before each flight and the crew may not always remember what is where.&nbsp; Stowage location U1 is immediately behind and below Charlie Duke's head on the right hand side of the cabin.]</p>

      <p class="ed">[The Temporary Stowage Bags are used for temporary stowage of small items, and for the disposal of dry refuse.&nbsp; There are three bags, one for each of the crew.&nbsp; The bags are stowed in U-1 for launch and entry.&nbsp; In flight, the Commander's bag attaches to the left shelf, the <a target="_new" href="acron.html#lmp">LMP</a>'s to the right shelf and the <a href="acron.html#cmp">CMP</a>'s to the lower equipment bay.&nbsp; (AOH 2.12.5.4.1).&nbsp; The helmet stowage bags prevent scratches and damage to the crews' plastic "bubble" helmets while not being worn.]</p>

They will be reacquired at 52 minutes, 39 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. We'll pass along at this time peak heart rates during the launch phase of flight. Peak heart rate for Command Module Pilot, Ken Mattingly, during the powered flight phase of flight read 115, for spacecraft commander John Young, 108, and for Lunar Module Pilot, Charles Duke, 130.

      <p class="ob"><b>000 25 15 Duke (onboard):</b> No, it's about 0.3.</p>
      <p class="ed">[The Apollo spacecraft uses a relatively simple system to maintain the cabin oxygen supply to the crew.&nbsp; Oxygen is stored in liquid form in three tanks in the Service Module.&nbsp; The Environmental Control System (ECS) draws off oxygen gas, heats it, and feeds it to the Command Module cabin through a pressure regulating system.&nbsp; As the crew converts oxygen to carbon-dioxide, the latter is absorbed by lithium dioxide scrubbers.&nbsp; This, and the inevitable leakage, reduces the pressure in the cabin, which is then topped up from the oxygen supply. Normal flow rate is about 0.43 lb/hour but this will depend on many factors, not least crew activity]</p>

      <p class="ed">[P52 is another of the Command Module Computer (CMC) programmes.&nbsp; This one is used to align the Inertial Measurement Unit in the Guidance and Nav System. Throughout the mission, one of Ken Mattingly's jobs is to ensure that the inertial guidance platform is kept aligned.&nbsp; He has just completed the first of numerous such realignments, a task usually known by the name of the program used, Program Number 52, or simply "P52".]</p>
      <p class="ed">[Guidance and navigation are crucial to any journey and even more so in the ballistic dance of getting to the Moon and back. The crew must be able point the spacecraft in precise, well known directions, so that their engines will send them where they want to go. The spacecraft carries a gyroscopically stabilised platform within the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) which remains fixed in attitude while the spacecraft rotates around it, connected to it by three orthogonal gimbals. The only way to ensure that the platform is properly aligned is to compare it to a fixed attitude reference - the stars are almost always used.&nbsp; Initially, the CSM (Command/Service Module)'s platform was aligned before launch. Realignment is achieved by using P52 on the CMC (Command Module Computer). With the spacecraft held in a steady attitude the sextant is pointed at a specified star, marked, then to a second star, where another mark is taken. The computer, knowing the attitude of the spacecraft (relative to its own idea of where the stars are), now has new values of where the stars are located. The amount of drift the platform has experienced since the previous realignment is calculated, and displayed as the amount of correction needed to move, or "torque" the gimbals to bring the platform back into accurate alignment. Known as "gyro torquing angles", they are displayed on the DSKY as "Noun 93". These angles are usually very small, and are expressed in thousandths of a degree.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[Before the platform realignment can begin, the optics dust cover, on the opposite side of the CM from the hatch, must be jettisoned to enable the spacecraft's optical instruments to be used.&nbsp; The cover protects the external surfaces of the sextant and scanning telescope during spacecraft preparation and launch. Ken is supposed to observe the jettison through the unity power SCT (Scanning Telescope). (A15FJ amended)]</p>

I have noticed one change since I've been here and that is that there is so much coolness in the room. I think you are getting a little bit bored with this thing, aren't you? I know you're not, and I assure that the people of this country aren't bored and if you went out in the vicinity of the Cape and looked around today you'd probably find the biggest crowd with more people enthusiastic about the space program than we've ever seen before. And, I want you to know that the administration's interest has not diminished and as Chairman of the Space Council mine continues to accelerate as I look forward to [Apollo] 17 and through the Skylab launchings to follow. What's going to come after that will depend to a great extent on the continuation of your expertise and the great way you discharge your responsibilities. But you know that the people of this country still have that explorer spirit. They still have that tremendous sense of urgency for the United States to be the leader of the world in this kind of technological advance. So, congratulations again to - for a superb job, and I never fail to marvel at the way you bring these things off. We're all with you and we appreciate what you've done.</p>

      <p class="ed">If a spacecraft is in orbit with a fixed attitude relative to the celestial sphere (i.e. the spacecraft keeps pointing to the same stars no matter where it is in its orbit), then its attitude relative to the body it's orbiting (Earth, Moon or whatever) is constantly changing. For example, if at one point in its orbit the front of a spacecraft is pointing directly at the planet below, then half an orbit later it will be pointing directly away. This is known as "stellar inertial."]</p>

      <p class="ed">[Conversely, if the spacecraft is to be flown in 'orb-rate,' keeping the same face towards the surface (to point cameras for example), it must rotate around one of its axes at a rate which matches the orbital period. Normally, the FDAI displays the spacecraft's attitude relative to the celestial sphere (i.e. it normally shows the inertial attitude) but the function of the ORDEAL is to provide the correct drive signal to rotate the FDAI at a rate which also matches the orbital period. With the ORDEAL, the FDAI will display attitudes relative to the surface below.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[The ORDEAL is a separate box of electronics that must be connected by the crew during use.&nbsp; When not in use it is kept in stowage U3 in the Upper Equipment Bay. The ORDEAL has several controls:</p>
      <p class="ed2">The Two FDAI switches set the relevant FDAI to display pitch attitude with respect to the local horizontal, or the inertial attitude (ie with the ORDEAL bypassed) </p>
      <p class="ed2">The 3-way Earth/Power Off/Lunar switch enables the ORDEAL to work in Earth or Lunar Orbit.</p>
      <p class="ed2">The Altitude Set dial allows the crew to dial in the orbital altitude, which determines the rotation rate at which the FDAI will be driven.</p>
      <p class="ed2">The 3-way Lighting switch controls the ORDEAL's electroluminescent panel.</p>
      <p class="ed2">The 2-way Mode and 3-way Slew switches allow the FDAI to be set to the correct initial attitude slowly (0.55 degrees/sec) or fast (10 degrees/sec).&nbsp; Once set using the Slew switch, the ORDEAL is set to Opr for normal operation.&nbsp; Hold would be used to maintain a constant ORDEAL output.]</p> <img style="width: 862px; height: 453px;" alt="Drawing of ORDEAL controls" src="pics/ordeal.gif" align="middle">

Evidently APS module number 2, which is our one on top of the vehicle, the one that would cause you to pitch away from the Earth; the primary helium regulator there has failed to the backup, and the backup isn't regulating properly. Normally, it should hold around 190 psi (1310 kPa). This pressurizes both fuel and oxidizer. And it has gradually increased now up around the 320 [psi] (2200 kPa) range. And there's a relief valve which will relieve helium pressure at 325 [psi] (2240 kPa) and reseat when the pressure gets down to 225 [psi] (1550 kPa). There should be a gradual loss of helium. We'll have a better hack at the States pass as to when you could expect a deplete.&nbsp; But should you lose control in orbit, go to the procedure on [Page] L2-10 for Service Module RCS control of the S-IVB. Over.</p>
      <p class="ed">[At its base, the S-IVB stage has two thruster units, one on either side. Known as the APS (Auxiliary Propulsion System), each one has two thrusters facing to either side of the unit which can rotate the stage in yaw or roll. Each also has one facing away from the stage which allows control of pitch, and one facing the same direction as the main J-2 engine. This last is used as a ullage motor to help push the propellants to the bottom of their tanks and give a head of pressure in the propellant lines. (A8FJ)]</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 1 hour, 4 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We've just had Loss Of signal with Honeysuckle. The problem discussed between CapCom Gordon Fullerton and the crew of Apollo 16 was one relating to the APS, the attitude propulsion system aboard the S-IVB and it deals with the regulator pressures on one of the APS, APS number 2. The normal reading is around 190 psi. We've shown an increase in the range of 320 psi. This system relieves at 325 psi and reseats once the number backs off to 225 psi. These are helium pressures that are being read. We're now at 1 hour, 5 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, and we will switch to Kennedy Space Center for the News Conference which will shortly be in progress.</p>

      <p class="ed">[Charlie Duke is providing a very short summary of the contingency procedure.&nbsp; Roughly translated, the crew first select the launch vehicle to be controlled by the Command Module Computer, then select the Reaction Control System to the appropriate mode.&nbsp; Mission control then set up the correct Launch Vehicle mode for the impending TLI burn.&nbsp; Launch Vehicle guidance is then returned to the Instrument Unit systems, so that the correct steering commands will be generated. </p>
      <p class="ed">The crew can then control spacecraft pitch and yaw attitude with the Translational Hand Controller and its roll attitude with the Rotational Hand Controller].</p>
      <p class="ed">The S-IVB is initially allowed to drift in pitch, allowing it to adopt the "gravity gradient" orientation, under which gravity will pull it gradually into vertical alignment with respect to the Earth.&nbsp; This minimises the use of RCS fuel, although it puts the S-IVB and CSM in an orientation that will cause more drag than its normal alignment pointing along the orbital track.&nbsp; It must be remembered that the spacecraft is still subject to the Earth's gravity field while in orbit, and that it is still low enough to feel the effects of Earth's atmosphere.</p>
      <p class="ed">The crew meantime control the S-IVB's yaw alignment within the spacecraft inertial platform limits.</p>
      <p class="ed">The crew otherwise follow normal procedures until 15 minutes before Time Base 6, then they manoeuvre to the correct attitude for TLI, and set up the ORDEAL.&nbsp; They then hold the correct TLI attitude until ignition.</p>
      <p class="ed">When the S-IVB APS fires in the ullage manoeuvre, the crew correct any deviations with the Service Module RCS.</p>
      <p class="ed">After S-IVB ignition for TLI, the crew select RCS Command Off, Auto RCS Select, 16, Main A, Main B. Manual Attitude, three, to Rate Command.</p>
      <p class="ed">After the S-IVB cut-off, the crew go back to CMC. Manual Attitude, three, Accel Command. RCS Command, On.&nbsp; This sets the SM RCS back to the state needed for Transposition and Docking.]</p>

      <p class="ob"><b>001 27 40 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Well, it's just like everybody said. They said it's like being on a freight train on a rough track. [Laughter] That's really weird. And when the...</p>
      <p class="ob"><b>001 27 51 Young (onboard):</b> The only thing that I didn't recognize was - there was a little ripple of pogo that kind of built up and died out to - to - to about 09:07 in the S-II burn, and then it quit at - and then after - after the engine shut down, I felt a little pogo.</p>

      <p class="ob"><b>001 28 40 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble] I wouldn't even think about it anymore. Okay, there's the coast of - of Baja.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston at 1 hour, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We presently show Apollo 16 at an orbit of 96 nautical miles (177 km) by 94 nautical miles (174 km). When we pick up over our State-side pass, we expect to have seen a release cycle with the regulator on the attitude control system Module Number 2 before we lost data over Australia. We have been noting an increase in the pressures on APS number 2. The one other point to bear in mind is that one module can control the spacecraft during the TLI burn since the only movement during that burn would be in roll. We're at 1 hour, 30 minutes. We're standing by now for acquisition. This is Apollo Control, Houston. </p>
