    <h5>Corrected Transcript and Commentary Copyright &copy; 2003 Tim Brandt and W. David Woods. All rights reserved.</h5> Last updated 2020-02-07 <p class=ed>[The Apollo 16 mission is the eleventh flight in the Apollo/Saturn V flight program, the sixth mission planned for lunar landing, and the fourth mission planned for landing in the lunar highlands. It is the second of the three ‘J’ Mission series which take advantage of greater Saturn V performance to launch a heavier spacecraft dedicated to scientific exploration of the Moon. The crew is John W. Young (Mission Commander), Tom "Ken" Mattingly II (Command Module Pilot), and Charles M. Duke, Jr. (Lunar Module Pilot). John Young is by this time the most experienced American astronaut still flying, having been the co-pilot on <i>Gemini III</i> (the first manned Gemini flight), the command pilot of <i>Gemini X</i> and the Command Module Pilot (CMP) for <i>Apollo 10</i>, the dress rehearsal for <i>Apollo 11</i>. Both Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke are rookies. Mattingly was previously been designated as the CMP for <i>Apollo 13</i> but was grounded 72 hours before that mission due to exposure to German Measles. Duke had been the back-up LMP for <i>Apollo 13</i> (incidentally, it was Duke's case of German Measles that led to Mattingly's grounding).]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The mission is also termed AS-511 (Apollo Saturn V number 11), and, in part due to the rivalries between the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston (now Johnston Space Center) which is responsible for the spacecraft and the Marshall Space Flight Centre at Huntsville, which is responsible for the Saturn V, it is sometimes termed SA-511.&nbsp; The launch vehicle comprises First Stage S-IC-11 (the eleventh production stage), Second Stage S-II-11, Third Stage S-IVB-511, and Instrument Unit IUS-511 (both the eleventh of each for the Saturn V). The Apollo Spacecraft comprises Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter SLA-20 (the twentieth production unit), Command Module CM-113 and Service Module SM-113 (the thirteenth of the Block 2 version of each), and Lunar Module LM-11. The LM houses Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV-2.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[Originally slated for launch on 17 March 1972, Apollo 16 is now prepared to go on 16 April, as the culmination of a long preparation. The crew assignments were formally announced over a year ago on 3 March 1971, and the elements of the spacecraft began to arrive at the Kennedy Space Centre in July 1971. Apollo 16's preparation has not been without incident.&nbsp; In mid-November, the three main parachutes had to be replaced after the failure of a connector link left Apollo 15 with only two of its three parachutes operative at splashdown.&nbsp; On 13 December 1970 the combined "stack" of the Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V were moved from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to Launch Pad 39A. However, a mistake during subsequent testing resulted in the bursting of one of the teflon bladders that contained the hypergolic fuel in the Command Module’s Reaction Control System (RCS).&nbsp; Since the test had used helium gas rather than the actual fuel, there was only limited damage.&nbsp; However, the replacement of the RCS tank was required which in turn needed disturbance of the CM heatshield (Moonport p518). A further problem was the need to change one of the explosive cords that separate the LM from the CSM prior to Earth return. A failure in a similar device during testing for Skylab raised concerns over that fitted to Apollo 16, and it was decided to replace it (AWST 10 Jan 72 p21, 17 Jan 72 p19).&nbsp; These 2 problems led to the decision to return the stack to the VAB for the first time in the Apollo program.&nbsp; A third problem was a delay in modifying the crew’s spacesuits after Charles Duke's suffered failure of a clamp during training.&nbsp; As a result of all 3 problems, the launch date has been slipped from 17 March to 16 April, the next launch window for the mission.&nbsp; The timing of an Apollo launch to the Moon falls within certain 'windows', or periods of time, which are influenced by both daily and monthly factors. The daily restriction to the window is due to the rotation of the Earth bringing the launch site to the correct relationship with the Moon's position in its orbit, to allow enough of a parking orbit around the Earth before the boost to the Moon. The monthly factor is the lighting requirements at the landing site. The landing has to take place in the early lunar morning so that the Sun is behind the astronauts as they approach from their east-to-west orbit. A low Sun-angle produces shadows on the lunar terrain which help the crew to recognize landmarks as well as aiding speed and distance perception. With a lunar day lasting 29.5 Earth days, the correct conditions for the landing only occur once a month.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[There are 3 separate recording transcripts available of the mission at this point. These are the Technical Air To Ground Voice (TEC) Transcription, which documents all radio communication between Mission Control and the spacecraft and which has been carefully transcribed.&nbsp; The second is the Public Affairs Office (PAO) Transcript which was produced at the time from the public feed of the mission audio. It includes commentary from the occupant of the PAO console in Mission Control as well as much radio communication. Having been transcribed in a hurry by stenographers for use by journalists, it is very prone to errors.&nbsp; The third recording is the Command Module Onboard Voice (CM) Transcription.&nbsp; This is recorded on the Data Recorder Reproducer (DRR) - a tape recorder with 2,200 feet of tape giving 4 hours of recording at Low rate, or 60 minutes at High, fitted in the Command Module Lower Equipment Bay. &nbsp;The recorder is switched on during powered flight and during times that the spacecraft is out of contact with the ground. It can then be played back and transmitted to the ground.&nbsp; It can also be used to record data from some of the scientific experiments carried. The voice recordings from the DRR are not continuous throughout the flight. However, for the periods they are available, the CM transcriptions give a real insight into the crew's informal discussion and chat.&nbsp; Readers should note that if an utterance by a crewmember is listed as "onboard", the ground crews are not hearing it live at that time. They will be able to hear the onboard voice after they have replayed it to Earth during a regular dump of the tape.&nbsp; There are minor differences between the transcriptions, partly as the crew’s discussions could mask off Mission Control reception.&nbsp; Also, the quality of the tapes makes the transcription process subjective at times.]</p>

    <p><i>Command Module Main Display Console from Apollo Operations Handbook Block II Spacecraft (October 15, 1969). This console comprises panels 1, 2 and 3, and is very similar, though not identical, to the console in the Apollo 16 Command Module. This and other diagrams of the Apollo spacecraft are available from the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/diagrams/apollo.html"> Diagram page of the NASA History Website</a></i></p>
    <p class=ed>[At first glance, the Main Display Console of the Command Module is highly complex. However, it is also highly structured, with all the controls for the various systems grouped together, and positioned where they will be visible and accessible during flight. The complexity of the controls is a reflection of the complexity of the spacecraft – the Apollo spacecraft is arguably one of the most complex flying machines ever created – before or since. Compared to aircraft cockpits, the main difference is the need to group all the controls where the crew can reach them while strapped into their seats and wearing spacesuits. The number of instruments is less than on many aircraft – much of the monitoring function carried out by an aircraft’s crew is performed by the controllers on the ground at Kennedy Space Center or in Houston. Many of the displays also have multiple functions – for example displaying one parameter during launch and another later in the flight. Almost all are analogue instruments, with few digital displays. The crew has full control of all the systems, however, unlike their counterparts on Soviet spacecraft. Hence, the large number of switches and other controls. As former fast-jet pilots, the crew are already well accustomed to working in such an environment, but the complexity of Apollo has required many hours of work in the simulator to learn to &quot;fly&quot; the craft in an emergency.]</p>

    <p class=pao><b>-001:30 Public Affairs Officer</b>: "This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're at T-minus 1 hour, 30 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. Just seconds from now a final gemsphere release will be made. A gemsphere is a weather balloon which measures the winds aloft. However, we don't anticipate any problems with any type of weather this morning. The spacecraft checkout is continuing ahead of schedule according to the test conductor Skip Chauvin. The cabin purge has been completed and the spacecraft pressurized with a 60-40 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. This mixture is similar to air, is pressurized slightly above the ambient pressure and then the crew checks for any possible decay in that pressure. This ensures that we've had a proper seal with the hatch, which came closed earlier and that we have no spacecraft leaks. These activities continuing at this time. T-minus 1 hour, 30 minutes, 9 seconds and counting. This is Kennedy Launch Control."</p>
    <p class=ed>[The introduction of a mixed nitrogen/oxygen cabin atmosphere was a design change after the <i>Apollo 1</i> fire. Apollo is designed for a cabin pressure of 6 psi in space, to provide sufficient oxygen for the crew to operate without spacesuits. Since the actual amount of oxygen they breathe is determined by the partial pressure of oxygen (the contribution to the total cabin pressure provided by the oxygen alone), this 60/40 mix provides a little more oxygen than the 20 percent oxygen content of air at a sea level pressure of 15 psi (1 bar). However, the crew are wearing their spacesuits with the helmets closed and are breathing pure oxygen to flush out the nitrogen in their blood.&nbsp; In the event of a sudden loss of pressure in the spacecraft, any residual nitrogen dissolved in their blood would come out of solution and cause the "bends". The suit pressure is slightly more than cabin pressure to prevent any flow of cabin air into the suit. After launch, the cabin pressure relief valve will bleed air out of the cabin until the external pressure falls to 6 psi (0.4 bar) or equivalent to about 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) altitude on Earth. The environmental control system will continue to pump 0.6 pounds per hour (0.27 kg per hour) of oxygen into the cabin until the crew close the Direct O<sub>2</sub> valve after orbit is reached, and until then the pressure relief valve will dump the excess cabin air overboard. The aim is to reach orbit with minimal nitrogen in the cabin atmosphere.]</p>

    <p class=pao><b>-000:54 Public Affairs Officer:</b> "This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control at T-minus 54 minutes and counting, T-minus 54 minutes and counting. Earlier this morning the cryogenics were loaded aboard the Saturn V space vehicle. The flight crew then came aboard and is now onboard completing a series of communications checks. The weather continues to be clear as it's supposed to be for our launch time, and we continue to aim for a launch at 12:54 pm Eastern Standard Time. The Command Communications System which carries the launch vehicle commands on S-band frequency has now been turned on for launch.

    <p class=ed>[Although the RP-1 (kerosene) fuel for the S-IC was loaded some time before, the oxygen and hydrogen propellants must be loaded shortly before launch, since they will boil-off despite the insulation on the tanks.&nbsp; The loading procedure is complex.&nbsp; Air and water vapor is purged from the tanks by repeated pressurization and venting with helium. Helium is used because nitrogen would freeze in the presence of liquid hydrogen. Once clear of contaminants, the tanks are cooled to accept the propellants by first passing cold gas through the system then feeding propellant at a slow rate and allowing it to boil off, taking heat with it. Seven hours before launch, LOX is fed at 31.5 litres per second until it is 5% full, then the fill rate goes to 315 litres per second to take the tank to 96% full. This takes about 25 minutes and then the tank is topped up at 63 litres per second. Five hours before launch and after purging and cooling, LH<sub>2</sub> enters at 63 litres per second, further cooling its tank so that propellant begins to remain liquid and rise in level in a process similar to that for the LOX tanks. Once the level of liquid propellant reaches 5 percent, the fill rate is increased to 630 litres per second until the tank is 98 percent full, when the fill rate reduces again to 63 litres per second to top off the tank's load. To compensate for loss due to boil-off, both tanks are replenished until about three minutes before launch when the tanks are pressurized. Up to the launch, pressurizing helium gas is supplied from the ground. After launch, the boil-off of the propellants is enough to maintain pressure until the engines are ignited 2 minutes and 40 seconds into the flight.]</p>

The charge for the S-IC would cut a longitudinal breach in the fuel tank on the opposite side of the vehicle from that for the oxidizer tank so as to minimize their mixing during dispersion. Charges for the S-II would cut a 9-metre longitudinal opening in the hydrogen fuel tank and a series of lateral 4-metre ruptures in the squat LOX (liquid oxygen) tank. Those for the S-IVB would make two parallel 6-metre openings in the fuel tank and a 1.2-metre diameter hole in the LOX tank.

    <p class=ed>[Early in the Apollo program, the Air Force had insisted that the LM, a vehicle from which every ounce of unneeded weight had been trimmed and which would be a home to men on the lunar surface, also had to have destruct ordnance attached. This was based on the premise that, in the event of a launch abort, it was better for propellants to be consumed before reaching the ground. After all, the LM would be unmanned at this stage. NASA pointed out the weight and safety penalties of this arrangement and eventually won what was a substantial argument by pointing out that the LM was hardly likely to survive the destruction of the S-IVB stage anyway.

    <p class=ed>[Ignition starts at 9 seconds before lift-off.&nbsp; The ignition sequence of an F-1 engine is a complicated affair with many interrelated events happening almost simultaneously.]</p>
    <p class=ed><a href="pics/f-1_big.jpg" target="new"><img src="pics/f-1_small.jpg" alt="Labelled diagram of F-1 engine" border="0" height="642" width="688"></a></p>
    <p class=ed>[<a name="f1desc"></a>First, a description of the engine.&nbsp; A large combustion chamber and bell-shaped thrust chamber have an injector plate at the top, through which RP-1 fuel and LOX are injected at high pressure. Above the injector is the LOX dome which also transmits the force of the thrust from the engine to the rocket's structure. A single-shaft turbopump is mounted beside the combustion chamber. The turbine is at the bottom and is driven by the exhaust gas from burning RP-1 and LOX in a fuel-rich mixture in a gas generator. After powering the turbine, the exhaust gas passes through a heat exchanger, then to a wrap-around exhaust manifold which feeds it into the periphery of the engine bell. The final task for these hot gases is to cool and protect the nozzle extension from the far hotter exhaust of the main engine itself. Above the turbine, on the same shaft, is the fuel pump. It has two inlets from the fuel tank and two outlets going, via shutoff valves, to the injector plate. A line from one of these 'feeds' supplies the gas generator with fuel. Fuel is also used within the engine as a lubricant and as a hydraulic working fluid, though before launch, RJ-1 ramjet fuel is supplied from the ground for this purpose. At the top of the turbopump shaft is the LOX pump with a single, large inlet in-line with the turboshaft axis. This pump also has two outlet lines, with valves, to feed the injector plate. One line also supplies LOX to the gas generator. The interior lining of the combustion chamber and engine bell consists of a myriad of pipework through which a large portion of the fuel supply is fed. This cools the chamber and bell structure while also pre-warming the fuel. Lastly, an igniter, containing a cartridge of hypergolic fluid with burst diaphragms at either end, is in the high pressure fuel circuit and has its own inject point in the combustion chamber. This fluid is triethylboron with 10-15% triethylaluminium.]</p>
    <p class=pao><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> "15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, we have ignition sequence start. The engine is now building up to 7.7 million pounds of thrust."</p>
    <p class=ed>[<a name="f1start"></a>At T minus 8.9 seconds, a signal from the automatic sequencer fires four pyrotechnic devices. Two initiate combustion within the gas generator while another two cause the fuel-rich turbine exhaust gas to ignite when it enters the engine bell. Links are burned away by these igniters to generate an electrical signal to move the start solenoid. The start solenoid directs hydraulic pressure from the ground supply to open the main LOX valves. LOX begins to flow through the LOX pump, starting it to rotate, then into the combustion chamber. The opening of both LOX valves also causes a valve to allow fuel and LOX into the gas generator, where they ignite and accelerate the turbine. Fuel and LOX pressures rise as the turbine gains speed. The fuel-rich exhaust from the gas generator ignites in the engine bell to prevent backfiring and burping of the engine. The increasing pressure in the fuel lines opens a valve, the igniter fuel valve, letting fuel pressure reach the hypergolic cartridge which promptly ruptures. Hypergolic fluid, followed by fuel, enters the chamber through its port where it spontaneously ignites on contact with the LOX already in the chamber.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[Rising combustion-induced pressure on the injector plate actuates the ignition monitor valve, directing hydraulic fluid to open the main fuel valves. These are the valves in the fuel lines between the turbopump and the injector plate. The fuel flushes out ethylene glycol which had been preloaded into the cooling pipework around the combustion chamber and nozzle. The heavy load of ethylene glycol mixed with the first injection of fuel slows the buildup of thrust, giving a gentler start. Fluid pressure through calibrated orifices completes the opening of the fuel valves and fuel enters the combustion chamber where it burns in the already flaming gases. The exact time that the main fuel valves open is sequenced across the five engines to spread the rise in applied force that the structure of the rocket must withstand.]</p>
    <p class=tech><b>-000:00:05 Fullerton:</b> Ignition, 4, 3...</p>
    <p class=ed>[As fuel and LOX flow increase to maximum, the rise in chamber pressure, and therefore thrust, is monitored to confirm that the required force has been achieved. With the turbopump at full speed, fuel pressure exceeds hydraulic pressure supplied from ground equipment. Check valves switch the engine's hydraulic supply to be fed from the rocket's fuel instead of from the ground.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[At lift-off, one of the most important areas of the main display console that the commander must monitor is the subpanel which annunciates the progress of the launch. From top to bottom, this subpanel contains the Abort light, Mission Event Timer, Launch Vehicle Engine lights, lift-off light and critical switches (with safety covers) that are used to override the automatic abort sequences.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[One second to lift-off, the five launch vehicle indicator lights in the spacecraft go out, announcing to the crew that the thrust is OK and the stack is about to be let go of the hold-down clamps. Another lamp is illuminated at the point of lift-off as a verification for the crew.&nbsp; Additionally, the Event Timer and the Mission Timer both reset to zero and start counting up again.&nbsp; The Event Timer is located near the upper left of the Main Display Console -&nbsp; <a href="01popup_evttmr.html" onclick="return popup(this, 'event_timer')">Event Timer</a> and the <a href="01popup_missiontmr.html" onclick="return popup(this, 'notes')">Mission Timer</a> at the upper centre of the MDC.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:00:00 Fullerton:</b> Lift-Off.</p>
    <p class=ed>[The stack is held onto the pad two ways. Four hold-down arms clamp the base of the S-IC, each with a force of 350 tonnes, anchoring the vehicle until full thrust is confirmed. A pneumatic device, backed up by an explosive, collapses the lever linkage to allow the arm to rise. Additionally, a number of controlled-release mechanisms (up to 16, depending on the mission) prevent the vehicle from accelerating too rapidly in the first moments of motion. These consist of tapered pins mounted to the pad which are pulled through dies mounted on the vehicle. The deformation of the pins controls the initial acceleration for the first 150 mm of flight; a simple and ingenious arrangement.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[Once the launch vehicle begins to rise, even fractionally, it cannot safely settle back onto the pad. Intentional engine shutdown will not occur, so of the nine access arms, the five which have remained attached up to this point, must now detach their umbilicals from the vehicle and swing clear. The first two centimetres of travel trigger the release of the umbilical connector plates which in turn triggers retraction of the arms.]</p>

    <p class=tech><b>000:00:06 Young</b>: Yaw program [garble, probably tower] clear.</p>
    <p class=pao><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> "We clear the tower."</p>
    <p class=ed>[On this, and all Saturn V launches, the stack can easily be seen leaning away from the LUT as it ascends from the launch pad. This yaw, begun 1.35 seconds after lift-off, maneuvers the vehicle 1.25&deg; from vertical in a direction away from the tower to ensure clearance in case a gust of wind pushes it back or a swing arm doesn't fully retract. Then nine seconds into the flight, almost as the rising rocket clears the tower, the stack is brought vertical again. To those who were not prepared for it, this fully intended yawing of over 110 metres of metal, filled to the brim with exotic fuels and oxidizers, could sometimes cause some consternation. The astronauts were also very aware that any guidance or engine steering control failure could cause a collision with the tower which would probably not have been survivable even with the Launch Escape System.&nbsp; On Apollo 16 there is minor anomaly in the maneuver, which is completed about 1 second late. This is due to a software glitch in the launch vehicle guidance system located in the Instrument Unit.&nbsp; Although not a major fault, it could have decreased the clearance from the tower and the IU computer will be reprogrammed for the Apollo 17 and Skylab launches.]</p>

    <p class=pao><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> "Pitch and roll program started."</p>
    <p class=ed>[The guidance of the launch vehicleis monitored and controlled by the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer in the IU and its programs, and not by the CM Guidance and Control System, which only monitors for now.&nbsp; The Pitch Program rolled and pitched the launch vehicle from its 90° east of north launch azimuth (fixed by the launch pad design) to the correct azimuth and elevation for its ascent to orbit (72.034° east of north for Apollo 16).&nbsp; The CM’s guidance system was used by the crew to provide an independent monitoring function, using the Command Module Computer’s (CMC’s) Program 11 (P11).&nbsp; The maximum pitch and yaw limits were 4° per second, and roll 11° per second.&nbsp; These were not bad given the size and mass of a fully loaded Saturn V!&nbsp; In extremis, the CM guidance system could be used to command the Saturn V, and there were numerous arguments among the astronauts on the feasibility of manually flying the Saturn V into orbit.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The CMC (Command Module Computer)is closely involved in computation of the spacecraft's trajectory throughout the flight though, during launch, the IU handles trajectory computation and vehicle control. The CMC is accessed by the crew via two DSKYs (Display and Keyboard), one of which is on the main instrument panel, the other being on the LEB (Lower Equipment Bay). The LM carries a computer of very similar design. The CMC contains a series of numbered Programs, which the crew control by entering numbers referred to as Verbs and Nouns. See the essay <a href="../compessay.html">The Apollo On-board Computers</a> by Phill Parker.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The CMC is set to P(rogram) 11 during launch, either automatically when the launch vehicle sensed lift-off, or by the crew selecting V(erb) 75 and Enter just after launch.</p>
    <p class=ed>[Dave Scott, Commander of Apollo 15, from 1998 correspondence - "The CMC computed the entire launch profile such that if the IU failed (at any time) the entire Saturn V, or subsequent stages, could be flown into orbit manually by using primarily the FDAI (Flight Director Attitude Indicator) and DSKY (Display-Keyboard) displays and one of the two RHCs (Rotational Hand Controllers). This is a little-known, but very important capability; and we spent a fair amount of time training for this. The DSKY display also provided a monitor of the IU performance, and if deviations were too large, the THC (Translation Hand Controller) could be used to disengage the IU completely and proceed with a manual launch insertion. Again, a very important 'abort-type' capability."]<br></p> <img style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);" src="pics/mdc_s_fdai.gif" usemap="#mdc_s_fdai" align="right" border="0" height="192" width="400"><map style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);" name="mdc_s_fdai"><area shape="rect" alt="Close-up of FDAI" coords="40,90,76,127" href="01popup_fdai.html" onclick="return popup(this, notes)" title="Close up of FDAI"><area shape="rect" alt="Close-up of FDAI" coords="100,49,141,88" href="01popup_fdai.html" onclick="return popup(this, notes)" title="Close up of FDAI"><area shape="default" nohref=""></map>
    <p class=ed>[The FDAI is the critical "flying" instrument in the CM.&nbsp; Also referred to as the '8-Ball' from its colouring, the FDAI is similar to the ball-style artificial horizon found on many aircraft and, likewise, allows determination of the spacecraft's attitude with respect to a desired frame of reference.&nbsp; Usually this will be the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) though it may be the GDC (Gyro Display Coupler), a device which displays the spacecraft's attitude compared to a crew preselected attitude. The FDAI will also show attitude errors and the rates of change of attitude.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[A fixed-base simulator is one which does not move to simulate flight.&nbsp; The Apollo simulators are almost all of the fixed-base type, apart from those used to simulate docking maneuvers.&nbsp; While restricted in fidelity, they are fine for training the crew on operation of the spacecraft systems.]</p>

I had the feeling it was a runaway freight train on a crooked track, swaying from side to side. That was all the way through the first stage."]</p> [Charlie Duke is not the first crewman to make this comparison.&nbsp; Bill Anders made a very similar remark about his ride aboard <i>Apollo 8’s</i> launch vehicle.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The four outer F-1 engines are gimballing to control the rocket’s attitude, causing rotation around its centre of gravity. Since most of the vehicle’s mass, the fuel and LOX of the first stage, is currently concentrated towards its base, the crew find themselves at the long end of a long see-saw and feel the side-to-side motions strongly.]</p>

The interaction of these two changing values will result in a maximum degree of pressure on the vehicle's skin at 1 minute, 26 seconds into the flight; at a speed of about Mach 1.7 and an altitude of 14.3 km. This moment of maximum dynamic pressure is also often described as "Max q" since "q" is the engineering term for dynamic pressure (which is a product of speed and atmospheric density).]</p>

    <p class=ed>[Throughout the powered ascent of the launch vehicle, there are various modes of aborting the mission, each of which are appropriate to the current height and speed. For the first two of these modes, IA and IB, the Flight Plan defines the safe range of vehicle motion rates as not exceeding ±4° per second in pitch and yaw, ±20° per second in roll. Motion rates exceeding these limits will entail an abort.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The initial 42 seconds, to an altitude of about 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) are flown in abort Mode IA (One Alpha). If a dangerous situation occurs within this period, the CM would separate from the SM, and the LET (Launch Escape Tower, or just 'tower'), which is the solid-fuelled rocket mounted on top of the CM, would carry it up from the wayward launch vehicle while a small 'pitch control' motor at the top of the LET steers the assembly east out over the ocean and away from a possibly exploding booster below. The tower would be jettisoned only 14 seconds after the initiation of the abort. While this is going on, the highly dangerous hypergolic propellants of the Command Module's RCS would quickly and automatically be dumped overboard as they would be harmful to the recovery forces. The CM would then descend on parachutes to a normal splashdown.&nbsp; The Mode IA Abort Procedures are on <a href="csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4">Page 4-1</a> of the Launch Checklist].</p>
    <p class=ed>[Abort Mode IB extends from 42 seconds into the flight to an altitude of 30.5 km (16.5 nautical miles) as defined by the abort checklist. With the vehicle being further downrange and tilted over, the pitch control motor would not be required in the event of a IB abort. However, it had been discovered during hypersonic testing, that the CM/LET stack could be aerodynamically stable in a tower-first as well as a base-first attitude so a pair of canards were added which would be deployed automatically to force the combination into an attitude where the base of the CM is facing the direction of travel, ready for the safe deployment of the drogue and main parachutes. While the canards have little effect in a low altitude abort, they become increasingly important as the Saturn V gains speed through the IB mode.&nbsp; The Mode IB Abort Procedures are on <a href="csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4">Page 4-1</a> of the Launch Checklist.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[Mode IC is used for aborts occurring between 30.5 km (16.5 nautical miles) and the jettison of the tower. As the air is now very thin, the airflow around the pair of canards at the top of the tower would have little aerodynamic effect during an abort. Instead, the tower and BPC would be jettisoned and the Command Module's RCS used to control the orientation of the spacecraft. The safe range of vehicle motion rates are now defined as not exceeding &plusmn;9&deg; per second in pitch and yaw, &plusmn;20&deg; per second in roll.&nbsp; The Mode IC Abort Procedures are on <a href="csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4">Page 4-2</a> of the Launch Checklist.]</p>

    <p class=pao><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> "Mark.&nbsp; Two minutes, 3 seconds. The status check in Mission Control by Flight Director Gene Kranz. The Go/No-Go for staging. Coming up on center engine shutdown."</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:02:04 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:02:05 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Those are done.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:02:06 Mattingly:</b> EDS is manual.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:02:08 Mattingly: (onboard)</b> And that - that baby is gonna unload.</p>
    <p class=ed>[As the S-IC nears the end of its burn, Ken Mattingly is inhibiting the EDS with a switch directly below the computer keypad. The EDS is only needed for flight through the thickest part of the atmosphere where high aerodynamic forces and the structural load they impart to the vehicle could cause loss of control to turn catastrophic too quickly for the crew to react in time. With EDS switched off, any required aborts must be initiated by the crew, giving them more control.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[When the S-IC shuts down, the stack will rapidly go from 3.85g forward acceleration to a slight deceleration caused by residual atmospheric drag until the S-II ignites. Mattingly is warning that the g-forces will rapidly reduce when this happens.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:02:10 Young (onboard):</b> It sure is.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:02:12 Duke (onboard):</b> Mm-hmm.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:02:13 Unidentified (onboard)</b>: (Laughter)</p>

    <p class=tech><b>000:02:22 Fullerton:</b> Roger; inboard. You're Go for staging.</p>
    <p class=ed>[Towards the end of the S-IC's boost phase, two factors serve to gradually increase the acceleration experienced onboard. First, the atmosphere is becoming essentially a vacuum, reducing the backpressure the exhaust gases have to fight against compared to the air pressure at sea level. This improves the efficiency of the engines so that from launch to cut-off, S-IC thrust rises 19% from 34,250 kN to about 40,700 kN. Second, the S-IC tanks are emptying, lightening the launch vehicle and presenting less inertia to the thrust. To alleviate these rising acceleration forces and the shock of all five engines shutting down simultaneously, the centre engine of the cluster is shut down 23.5 seconds earlier than the outboard engines. The outboard engines cutoff at 2:39.6, staging occurs at 2:40.7 and the second stage ignition command is at 2:41.8. The main reduction in thrust from full power on 4 engines to virtually zero will take less than 0.8 seconds.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[Another effect of the reduced air pressure on the S-IC is visible on movie coverage of the launch as the base of the vehicle appears to be progressively consumed by the conflagration. Near the ground, the plume is constrained by air pressure into a narrow flame extending rearwards. With decreasing air pressure, the hot gases are able to expand into an ever widening plume. Towards the end of the S-IC's flight, the air is so thin and the slipstream so negligible that a small amount of exhaust is able to expand forwards up the side of the rocket's structure giving the appearance, on TV coverage, of the rocket's base being consumed by the plume.]</p>

    <p class=tech><b>000:02:49 Young:</b> Okay, ignition on the S-II.</p>
    <p class=ed>[<a name="j2desc"></a>The S-II stage carries five J-2 uprated engines which burn LH<sub>2</sub> and LOX to produce up to 1,041 kN (234,000 pounds) thrust each. They are capable of being restarted in flight but this feature is only implemented in the engine used in the S-IVB.]</p> <a href="pics/j-2_big.gif" target="new"><img src="pics/j-2_small.jpg" alt="Labelled diagram of J-2 engine" border="0" height="476" width="654"></a></p>
    <p class=ed>[The thrust chamber and bell of each engine is fabricated from stainless steel tubes brazed together in a single unit. Supercold LH<sub>2</sub> is pumped through these tubes to cool the thrust chamber and simultaneously prewarm the fuel. The engine carries two separate turbopumps, both powered in turn by the exhaust from a gas generator which burns the stage's main propellants. The hot exhaust gas is fed from the gas generator, first to the fuel turbopump, then to the LOX turbopump before being routed to a heat exchanger and finally into the engine bell. The fuel and LOX outputs of both turbopumps are fed, via main control valves, to the thrust chamber injector via the LOX dome. Unlike the solid steel injector of the F-1, the J-2 injector is fabricated from layers of stainless steel mesh sintered into a single porous unit. A solid LOX injector behind this carries 614 posts which pass LOX through the injector and into the combustion chamber. Each post has a concentric fuel orifice around it and these orifices are attached to the porous injector. The fuel delivery is arranged to ensure that about 5 percent seeps through the injector face to cool it, the rest passing through the annular orifices.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The ASI (Augmented Spark Igniter), fed with propellant and mounted to the injector face, provides a flame to initiate full combustion. Valves are provided to bleed propellant through the supply system well before ignition to chill all components to their operating temperatures otherwise gas would be formed which would interfere with the engine's use of propellant as a lubricant in the turbopump bearings. A tank of gaseous helium is fabricated within a larger tank of gaseous hydrogen. This is the Start Tank. The helium provides control pressure for the engine's valves while the hydrogen spins up the turbopumps before the gas generator is ignited. A PU (Propellant Utilization) valve on the output of the LOX turbopump can open to reduce the LOX flowrate. This adjusts engine thrust down to 890 kN (200,000 pounds) during flight to optimise engine performance.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[<a name="j2start"></a>To start the J-2 engine, spark plugs in the ASI and gas generator are energised. The Helium Control and Ignition Phase valves are actuated. Helium pressure closes the Propellant Bleed valves, it purges the LOX dome and other parts of the engine. The Main Fuel valve and the ASI Oxidiser valves are opened. Flame from the ASI enters the thrust chamber while fuel begins to circulate through its walls under pressure from the fuel tank. After a delay to allow the thrust chamber walls to become conditioned to the chill of the fuel, the Start Tank is discharged through the turbines to spin them up. This delay depends on the role of the engine. A one second delay is used for the S-II engines. Half a second later, the Mainstage Control Solenoid begins the major sequence of the engine start. It opens the control valve of the gas generator where combustion begins and the exhaust supplies power for the turbopumps. The Main Oxidiser valve is opened 14° allowing LOX to begin burning with the fuel which has been circulating through the chamber walls. A valve which has been allowing the gas generator exhaust to bypass the LOX turbopump is closed allowing its turbine to build up to full speed. Finally, the pressure holding the Main Fuel valve at 14° is allowed to bleed away and the valve gradually opens, building the engine up to its rated thrust.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[The Apollo 16 mission is the eleventh flight of the Saturn V and the ninth manned launch of the booster. While the Apollo 16 launch vehicle configuration is essentially the same as that for Apollo 15, there have been continual small changes in configuration both to save weight and to fix problems. In many respects the Saturn V and Apollo spacecraft will remain experimental vehicles throughout their careers. The main change on AS-511 is the restoration of 4 retro-rockets to the S-IC stage to reduce the risk of collision between the first and second stages during separation. Until AS-510, 8 retrorockets were fitted in the outboard engine fairings and provided a total of 86,600 lbs force for 2/3 sec to help increase separation before ignition of the S-II's engines. The retrorockets are modified solid state Recruit rockets developed for the X-17 rocket used to test missile warheads in the 1950s and subsequently used for sounding rocket applications. Four were deleted from AS-510 as part of the weight savings to permit the carriage of the extra weight of the J-Mission spacecraft.&nbsp; In the event, separation distances during staging on Apollo 15 proved marginal and concern that failure of one retrorocket of the 4 could lead to the stages colliding has led to the return to 8 retrorockets on Apollo 16.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[The LES consists of the tower, with all its rocket motors, instrumentation and canards; and the BPC (Boost Protective Cover), which is a shroud over the entire Command Module which protects the spacecraft from the friction generated heat of ascent, and from the exhaust of the Launch Escape Motor should the tower be used for an abort. The BPC includes two windows to allow visibility through the left hand and central windows of the CM. The central window is mounted in the main hatch of the CM. Only when the LES is jettisoned are the other three windows uncovered.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The main rocket motor of the LES, if used, would burn for eight seconds, generating 654 kN (147,000 pounds) through four nozzles which are angled to direct the exhaust away from the CM.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[Abort Mode II lasts from the jettisoning of the tower to the decision to stage from the S-II to the S-IVB. In a Mode II abort, the Command and the Service Modules will separate from the launch vehicle and the SM main engine or its RCS engines will be used to get the spacecraft away from the launch vehicle. Then the CM and SM will separate before the CM completes a normal splashdown on the ocean.&nbsp; The Mode II Abort Procedures are on <a href="csmlc\csmlc.html#Section4">Page 4-3</a> of the LaunchChecklist.]</p>

    <p class=tech><b>000:03:30 Duke:</b> Evaporators On?</p>
    <p class=ed>[The CM has an Environmental Control System (ECS) cooling system using 2 glycol coolant loops.&nbsp; These are similar to those in a car engine; a glycol (antifreeze)/water mixture is pumped round a loop, collecting heat from the CM equipment and the crew spacesuits.&nbsp; It is then normally passed through radiators on the side of the SM, to cool it down by thermal radiation into space, before being pumped back into the CM. Until shortly before launch, the glycol is passed through refrigerators in the Launch Utility Tower to cool the spacecraft systems.&nbsp; Then, because the radiators are heated by friction with the atmosphere during ascent through the atmosphere, they are bypassed and the heat produced by the CM equipment and the crew is absorbed by the glycol and the pre-chilled structure. Once the spacecraft has reached an altitude of about 110,000 feet (30 kilometres), a secondary cooling system cuts in using the near vacuum to evaporate water, chilling the Evaporator. Glycol is then passed through the evaporator to cool it.&nbsp; Since the evaporator uses up water, the radiators are used in preference once the spacecraft is in orbit. At 000:02:45 Duke is supposed to have set 2 switches (Glycol Evaporator Steam Auto and Glycol Evaporator H<sub>2</sub>O Flow) to Auto in order to bring the evaporator on line. Mattingly is reminding him of this.&nbsp; Despite this, see 000:05:02]</p>

    <p class=ob><b>000:04:52 Young (onboard):</b> Rate Command.</p>
    <p class=ed>[The crew are preparing the Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine ready for use in case it is needed during an abort. The SPS would only be needed in the event of a Mode III or Mode IV abort after 000:05:52. In a Mode III abort, the SPS would be used to correct the spacecraft trajectory to achieve the desired landing site in the Atlantic. In a Mode IV abort, the SPS would be used to take the spacecraft to orbit. In each case the SM Reaction Control System (RCS) would first be used to separate the CSM from a wayward S-IVB. There is no possibility to use a fire-in-the-hole maneuver given the proximity of the SPS to the fully loaded LM propellant tanks.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[When the SPS is firing, the pitch and yaw attitude of the spacecraft must be controlled by positioning the gimbals that control the direction that the massive SPS engine is pointed in relative to the Service Module - the thrust vector. This can either be done automatically by the CMC, or manually by the CMP using the Rotational Controller. This latter is termed Manual Thrust Vector Control (MTVC), and this mode would be used in an abort since it provides more direct control to the pilot. However, the thrust vector must point through the spacecraft's centre of gravity or the spacecraft will start to tumble during any SPS burn. Under Rate command, any tendency to tumble is automatically corrected using signals from the spacecraft gyros. Under the alternative, termed Acceleration Command, the pilot must make the necessary corrections himself. Hence, Rate Command would make it easier to fly the spacecraft in what would be a very challenging situation. More information will be provided on the SPS later in the Flight Journal.]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:04:54 Mattingly (onboard):</b> And Alpha to P<sub>c</sub>.</p>
    <p class=ed>[Linked to the selection of Rate Command, the crew select the Launch Vehicle/SPS Chamber Pressure Switch to command the associated gauge from showing the angle of attack (Alpha) obtained from the Q-Ball on the now-jettisoned LES to the SPS thrust chamber pressure (P<sub>c</sub>) – another example of a dual purpose indicator]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:04:56 Young (onboard):</b> P<sub>c</sub>. Turn on our gimbal motors here at 6 minutes, Charlie.</p>
    <p class=ed>[The crew must now switch on the four SPS gimbal motors, two of which control the SPS engine orientation in pitch (Y axis) and two in yaw (Z axis). The SPS is able to vector (point) in slightly different directions to allow its thrust to be directed through the centre of mass of the spacecraft. Without this, firing the SPS would tend to make the spacecraft tumble, making accurate steering impossible. The range of movement is only 9° in each axis, but this is enough to cater for all planned configurations and fuel loads of the spacecraft.]</p>

    <p class=ed>[The COAS is the Crewman Optical Alignment Sight, which resembles an aircraft gunsight.&nbsp; It has 2 functions.&nbsp; First, it provides a range and range-rate display during docking, using a reticule focused at the same distance as the target.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it can be used to aim the 16mm data acquisition camera when this is mounted in the right-hand window.&nbsp; The COAS is stowed in a mount by the left-hand window during launch and entry, but can be used with either left or right rendezvous (forward facing) windows.]</p> <img src="pics/coas.gif" name="COAS" title="COAS" align="right" border="1" height="465" width="488">

    <p class=ob><b>000:14:56 Duke (onboard):</b> That's okay. I just pushed the breaker in.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:14:57 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:14:58 Duke:</b> Okay, Gordy; we're on page 2-11 [of the Launch Checklist] down through - We're getting to installing the COAS. That MA (Master Alarm) was the Transducer, ECS.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:15:06 Fullerton:</b> Roger, Charlie.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:09 Duke (onboard):</b> Oh, look how easy it is! Okay, Service Module...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:12 Young (onboard):</b> Charlie, did you do that?</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:13 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah, I did that, but I'm sorry (laughter). Okay, Waste H<sub>2</sub>O/Dump; Fuel Cell's going Normal; Purge Line Heater's on.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:26 Young (onboard):</b> (Laughter) Did you...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:32 Duke (onboard):</b> Look at those - little...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:35 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah, you...</p>
    <p class=ed>[The crew are now onto&nbsp; <a href="csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-12">Page 2-12</a> of the Launch Checklist.&nbsp; However, the sequence with which actions are carried out from this point are not necessarily in the order given in the Checklist.]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:36 Duke (onboard):</b> Let's see, [garble] got the torquing angles. You got...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:37 Young (onboard):</b> And I made it up with a clean window.</p>
    <p class=ed>[Especially during the early flights of Apollo, the clarity of the Command Module windows was a major problem.&nbsp; There were 2 main causes:&nbsp; contamination due to the rocket that removed the Boost Protective Cover, and out-gassing of solvents in the sealant used on the windows.&nbsp; By the time of Apollo 16, many fixes had been introduced and the only major problem is some condensation between the inner and outer panes, and a 2 inch smear of contaminant on the outside of one of the side windows.&nbsp; For John Young’s window to be clean is therefore a significant, if minor, victory.]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:39 Duke (onboard):</b> Sure. Yeah.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:41 Young (onboard):</b> Whoops. MA (Master Alarm) again.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:42 Duke (onboard):</b> No, I'm testing.</p>
    <p class=ed>[Charlie Duke is testing the Master Alarm, as both he and Ken Mattingly are having problems hearing it.&nbsp; The Master Alarm is a combination of visual alert (2 lights on the Main Display Console, one in the Lower Equipment Bay) and an audio signal in the crew’s headsets.&nbsp; Pressing any of the lights cancels the audio and visual alerts.]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:43 Young (onboard):</b> Yeah?</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:44 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah. Okay, going to Command Module...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:46 Mattingly (onboard):</b> But you...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:47 Duke (onboard):</b> ...you get an MA [Master Alarm]?</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:48 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:49 Duke (onboard):</b> Listen to that tone. Barely audible.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah.</p>
    <p class=ed>[The crew are back at <a href="csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-11">Page 2-11</a> of the Launch Checklist.]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:51 Young (onboard):</b>Shoot. I don't have any trouble hearing it. Hatch Gear Box is Latch; Actuator Handle is going to neutral [garble]...</p>
    <p class=ed>[The CM hatch has 2 modes of operation.&nbsp; Before launch, any need to operate the hatch must overcome both its own weight and that of the Boost Protective Cover hatch.&nbsp; To help, a lever mechanism including a pressurized nitrogen cylinder provides assistance to open the hatch(s).&nbsp; After reaching orbit, the gas must be vented to prevent over rapid opening of the weightless hatch.&nbsp; A spare gas cylinder provides the means to re-pressurise the nitrogen cylinder for Earth landing.]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:57 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh, John...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:58 Young (onboard):</b> Excuse me there, Charlie.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:15:59 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I'm gonna leave the nitrogen in the - in the hatch. We're gonna pump that when we get back. I talked to the guys about that.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:08 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:09 Mattingly (onboard):</b> They said that'd be okay.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:11 Young (onboard):</b> Fine.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:12 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, and I've got a note in the Flight Plan that says we're to vent it later on.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:16 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay, we just had loss of comm.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:16:18 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 16, Houston.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:19 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay. Ohhh.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:21 Young (onboard):</b> Ohhh. Is that ever nice! Look at that [garble]...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:24 Duke (onboard):</b> Look at that view out there, you guys!</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:27 Someone (onboard):</b> (Laughter)</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:28 Young (onboard):</b> Oh, is that ever pretty.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:30 Duke (onboard):</b> Hey, it's b - blacker than pitch out this window five.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:33 Young (onboard):</b> Supposed to be, Charlie. That's the rule of it.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:35 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble.] Yeah.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, I got your Verb 83 up there. I don't know what you're gonna do with it. I [garble] just buy it for you.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:40 Young (onboard):</b> That really is nice, that Verb 83 (laughter).</p>
    <p class=ed>[Verb 83 calls up rendezvous parameters; Range, Range-rate and Theta, on the DSKY.</p> <img src="pics/theta.gif" style="width: 351px; height: 214px;" alt="Diagram explaining the angle Theta.">
    <p class=ed>Theta represents the angle between the spacecraft's plus-X axis and the local horizontal (the horizontal of the ground beneath them). They use this angle to set up the ORDEAL, a device that drives the FDAI balls in sympathy with the spacecraft’s orbit. Normally, the FDAI show attitudes with respect to the stars - called "inertial attitude". By rotating them synchronously with their orbit, and starting them at the correct angle, the FDAI can be made to show pitch angles relative to the local horizontal throughout the orbit. To initialise the ORDEAL, Ken must set the FDAI to their current pitch angle which he gets from Verb 83.]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:43 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay, I'm gonna start in on the...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:66 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, I've got eight grays. That all looks like a champ. Okay, cabin pressure's good.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:52 Young (onboard):</b> If you'll get me a camera, I'll take a nice picture.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:55 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I'll go get those in just a minute, babe.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:57 Young (onboard):</b> Okay.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:16:58 Duke (onboard):</b> It looks like those clouds are right on top - right down there. You could reach out and touch them.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:17:01 Young (onboard):</b> They are. We're coming up over the Africa, Charlie, and...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:17:04 Duke (onboard):</b> Where's Africa? I don't see it.</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:17:07 Young (onboard):</b> Well...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:17:08 Duke (onboard):</b> Is it - maybe I can just look...</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:17:09 Young (onboard):</b> This is just - these little old - It's clouds like this or like it...</p>
    <p class=ed>[Break in CM tape]</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:17:16 Fullerton:</b> Apollo 16 through Canaries. How do you read?</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:17:21 Duke:</b> Okay, you're 5 by, Gordy.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:17:23 Fullerton:</b> Okay; we're noticing a possible blockage in the primary coolant loop. Would you have John check the Glycol Reservoir Bypass valve to be sure it's Open?</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:17:36 Duke:</b> Roger. [Garble].</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:18:48 Duke:</b> Hey, Gordy, do you want us to go ahead and - and - put the radiators on?</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:18:52 Fullerton:</b> Stand by.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:19:06 Fullerton:</b> Charlie, this is Houston. Whatever you just did up there got the coolant loop flow back. We'd like to watch it for a minute before proceeding. Over.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:19:15 Duke:</b> Okay, we're at step 12, page 2-13, configuration now with radiators at bypass. We've got the - the Reservoir Bypass Open, and the Outlet and the Inlet [valves] Closed.</p>
    <p class=ed>[As Charlie Duke states, the crew are now on <a href="csmlc\csmlc.html#Page2-13">Page 2-13</a> of the Launch Checklist and <a href="aoh_op_procs.html#Insertion">Page 4-68</a> of the Operational Procedures.]</p>
    <p class=ed>[The ECS Post Insertion Configuration is the second stage in setting the Environmental Control System to its flight configuration.&nbsp; During launch, the valves are set to allow fluid to circulate through the reservoir.&nbsp; After orbital insertion, the reservoir is isolated to provide a reserve source of coolant in case of leakage.]</span>
    <p class=tech><b>000:19:25 Young:</b> Okay, let me tell you what it was, Gordon, I think, is the - the Outlet [valve] was - was accidentally Open, probably at - at some other time, and the - the Bypass [valve] was Closed and the Inlet [valve] was - was Open. That's probably been the indications on the line.</p>
    <p class=ed>[From the Mission Report - "Shortly after orbital insertion, as the water/glycol reservoir was being isolated, the system valves were inadvertently positioned to completely block the primary coolant loop.&nbsp; The system was supplying no additional heat load in this configuration; therefore, the evaporator started to freeze and the indicated back pressure reached the lower limit of 0.05 psia.&nbsp; The reservoir valves were repositioned, flow was restored and the evaporator recovered smoothly with no adverse effects."]</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:19:47 Fullerton:</b> Roger. Understand.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:19:57 Young:</b> We're coming up over Africa now, Gordon, and it really is a spectacular view.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:20:03 Fullerton:</b> Roger. I wish I was there with you.</p>
    <p class=ed>[Gordon Fullerton finally made it to orbit in March 1982, as the pilot on STS-3, the third Space Shuttle mission.]</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:20:07 Young:</b> I guess we're - we're just over the Canaries looking down at those little islands, and that sure is something.</p>
    <p class=pao><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> "Apollo Control Houston. 20 minutes ground elapsed time. That again that was John Young commander of Apollo 16 appraising the view over this Canary Island pass. We're at 21 minutes ground..."</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:20:36 Fullerton:</b> 16, Houston. You can proceed with the rest of the normal ECS configuration.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:20:43 Young:</b> Roger. That's in work.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:20:59 Fullerton:</b> 16, Houston. We're having a - kind of intermittent data down here due to a problem with Canaries antenna.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:21:17 Young:</b> Okay, we're gonna put the glycol to the res - to the radiators now.</p>
    <p class=tech><b>000:21:23 Fullerton:</b> Roger.</p>
    <p class=pao><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> "This is Apollo Control, Houston. 22 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. We show a present orbit of 96 nautical miles by 91 nautical miles [154 by 146 kilometres]. About a minute to go until loss of signal with Canary. A quick status check being taken at Mission Control Center by flight director Gene Kranz with his flight control team to try and pass up a final few words with the 16 crew before we have loss of signal. We're at 23 minutes Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, Houston."</p>
    <p class=ed>[CM Tape on again]</p>
    <p class=ob><b>000:22:21 Duke (onboard):</b> Okay, I'm going to unhook and stow - unstow the helmet bags.</p>

    <p class=tech><b>000:22:37 Fullerton:</b> [Apollo] 16, Houston. Data is back now good, and everything looks fine as we come up 20 seconds to LOS (Loss of Signal). We'll see you at Carnarvon at 52:39.</p>
