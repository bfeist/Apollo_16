We're less than a minute away now from reacquiring Apollo 16 now [on] its 62 - sixty second revolution. We show a little more [than] 13 minutes away now for time of Lunar Module jettison and this will be coming up on this frontside pass, and the Command and Service Module separation is scheduled some 5 minutes later. This is at 195 hours, 15 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. It will be [a] two foot per second retrograde burn. We'll stand by and await conversation with the crew of Apollo 16.

      <p class="tech"><b>194 48 29 Duke:</b> Okay, Hank. We're closed out. The tunnel vent - the tunnel is being vented now. One question on that LM - that was a pretty big bird. You got enough RCS - I did not crossfeed. You got enough RCS?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>194 48 47 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>194 54 28 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Proceed with the logics check, and we're trying to get a Go/No Go on the jett right now.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 00 54 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative. Okay. And, Hank, would you run over my RCS select procedures again? I'm not sure I got the right combination for you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 01 22 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We don't have High Bit Rate. The way you can do this is ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 01 29 Mattingly:</b> What should they be, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 01 33 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We just want the single jet authority in roll. That's the only thing we have to worry about the boom. And you're gonna have to burn out the - your Y as if you were trimming the plane-change burn, using that same roll and - roll 90 degrees to get rid of your Y.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 02 08 Mattingly:</b> If I go into attitude, I can get it all in - get rid of the Y anyhow, can't I?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 02 19 Mattingly:</b> If I get over to zero yaw, I can get rid of this Y. Isn't that correct.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 03 18 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. And, of course with - you can't trim plus-Z. That's just like as if you were trimming on TEI. You're going to have to roll 90, and trim out your - your plus-Z.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 03 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 07 59 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. 140, 357, 000; and the jett time is - We've selected as 195:35, but the time is good from 00:25 to 00:45.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 08 19 Duke:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 08 36 Hartsfield:</b> And, 16; Houston. The high-gain angles for that attitude are plus 6, 345 yaw.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 09 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Plus 6 for pitch, yaw 345, Manual and Wide.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 10 15 Duke:</b> Okay, Houston. Tell me what you think went wrong on that LM jett.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 10 23 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by. We're still trying to psych it out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 11 56 Duke:</b> Houston, Orion didn't look like she fired any jets when we separated at all.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 12 04 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. No jet firing. And we didn't see any on the telemetry that we had down here, either.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 12 37 Young:</b> That Orion was a mighty good spacecraft. Real beautiful flying machine and a real great lunar base, too. We'll miss her.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 13 28 Hartsfield:</b> They looked good, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 16 07 Hartsfield:</b> Apollo 16, Houston. If possible, we would like to have somebody watch when you jettison the boom; see if they can see it going.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 16 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 16 29 Mattingly:</b> Hank, would you give me the jettison time again, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 16 34 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We have given you a time of 195:35 [195:23], Ken, but anywhere between 00:25 and 00:45 is good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 16 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That goes for 00:25 to 00:45.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 16 57 Hartsfield:</b> This attitude should put the CSM out in front of everything, the boom and the LM.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 21 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 21 33 Hartsfield:</b> And, Apollo 16; for your information, that boom jett velocity is somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 feet per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 21 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> Apollo Control, Houston. The loss of attitude control on Lunar Module Orion precludes the possibility of a targeted burn.

      <p class="tech"><b>195 28 53 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 28 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Now, 218 hours there is now 196:10 [195:59]. And you have a constant delta ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 29 01 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 29 02 Hartsfield:</b> ... constant delta from now on of subtracting 21 hours and 50 minutes, and this will apply through TEI.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 29 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's a minus 21:50 through TEI, and I think I have marked all my pages with that amount already.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 29 28 Hartsfield:</b> All righty. Then the first change is at 196:21. Delete the "Verb 48" and the "P20" and the "Set Omni." Just delete that group of data.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 29 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 29 54 Hartsfield:</b> At 196:35, add "Enable all jets, except A-1, A-2, B-1, Bravo 2, Delta 1, Delta 2."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 30 19 Mattingly:</b> Hank, is that the SlM jett - jett configuration?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 30 21 Hartsfield:</b> Negative. This gives you couple jets in all axes but roll, and we want Quad 3 providing roll control. Now this is so FDO can get good tracking for TEI, and this is being coordinated with OSC and is acceptable to the Mapping Camera pads.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 30 40 Mattingly:</b> Okay, why don't you - you read me a list of jets not to have on. Is that right?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 30 48 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. Everything on, except Alfa 1 and Alfa 2 ...</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>195 31 14 Hartsfield:</b> This just gives you B/D Roll, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 31 22 Mattingly:</b> Yea, that Logic probably should go back to - No, - center. Bottom position's okay, too. That's it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 31 44 Hartsfield:</b> Do you have that, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 31 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay, at 35 - that's 196:35, you've got enable everything except these, and the exceptions are A-1, 2, B-1, B-2, D-1, and D-2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 32 00 Hartsfield:</b> That's correct. And following that, P20 Option 5 plus-X forward SIM attitude - to be there at 196:41. Noun 79, 0.5-degree dead band. High Gain, Pitch 10, Yaw 0 for AOS acq.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 32 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank, does that mean that the - that the jettison attitude is going to be very close to the P20 attitude?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 32 58 Hartsfield:</b> Should be about a six-minute maneuver.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 33 08 Mattingly:</b> Well, was there any reason for not doing all that stuff earlier?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 33 15 Hartsfield:</b> What are you referring to, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 33 20 Mattingly:</b> Well, you just gave me a maneuver here to be done after I enable the engines at 00:35 and - and to be there by 00:41. And, we keep running into these things where you roll out and start the camera; and, if that's the case, I'd like to start the maneuver a little earlier. I'd like to have some padding there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 33 50 Hartsfield:</b> Okays I guess I don't see any magic about - about the time when you do that. If you want to back it up, that's fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 33 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We'll do so. Thank you very much. But we'll be there in any event by 00:41.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 34 06 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And at 00:42, and I don't see why you can't do this one early either, Mapping Camera/Laser Altimeter Cover, Open; Mapping Camera, Extend.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>195 34 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We'll get the Mapping Camera covers open and the Camera extended.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control at 197 hours, 10 minutes. During the change of shift briefing we reacquired Apollo 16. The Spacecraft [is] now in its 63rd revolution of the Moon. We expect this to be a relatively quiet front side pass. Among the things that we'll be reading up for the crew, will be the numbers that they will use, these will be preliminary numbers, for the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. Which is to occur on the 65th revolution at about 200 hours, 33 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Ken Mattingly is presently operating the cameras getting some pictures from the Command Module and also we'll have the Pan Camera operating during a portion of this front side pass. We have accumulated a small amount of taped conversation we'll replay that for you at this time and then continue to stand by live.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 44 30 Peterson:</b> Casper, Houston. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 44 45 Peterson:</b> Casper, Houston. How do you read?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 45 22 Peterson:</b> Casper, how do you read Houston?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 45 30 Mattingly:</b> Hello there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 45 32 Peterson:</b> How you doing?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 46 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay, looks like we got a good lock now.</p> <a name="196_46_32"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 46 32 Peterson:</b> Okay. And, Ken, would you verify that you copied the Flight Plan changes at 197:03 and 197:05 that were given just prior to LOS.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 46 51 Mattingly:</b> Well, I don't know if I copied the ones that you think you gave. I copied some that said, "IMC to barber pole, and Pan Camera, Standby, Stereo, Power," and then something got started about orbital science photos, and that was all I got.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 47 06 Peterson:</b> Okay, the first one there that you just read back was at 197:03; and at 197:05, we have "Configure Camera for orbital science, Command Module 5/EL/250/CEX intervalometer f/8, 1/250, infinity, 128 frames, magazine Romeo Romeo."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 48 30 Mattingly:</b> Don, you gonna give me some words on what that target is?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 48 35 Peterson:</b> Stand by one. I'll get you that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 48 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay, why don't you - can you give me some idea of how long it'll be? I'm - I - I don't know whether I have time to take my suit off or what.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 48 57 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken, that - that target position you're going to add are Vogel, and - and that goes all the way up through the cinder cone there. Actually, you're changing over at Alpetragius - a little jog, and then on up past the cinder cone. And you were originally scheduled to look at Bullialdus, and we're going to have to delete that because your track is too far to the north now. So, we're going to bring your groundtrack from the cinder cone right on up through Helmet and Gassendi and on up to Mersenius Rille, from D-11, 12, and 13.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 49 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you want to take one continuous strip.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 49 43 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 49 44 Mattingly:</b> Make one continuous strip from Vogel to Alpetragius to the cinder cone to the Helmet to Gassendi to the Mersenius Rille.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 49 54 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative; except there will be that little jog at Alpetragius over to - to the right there and then on up through cinder cone and straight on up through Helmet, then Gassendi and on up to the rille.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 50 08 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, I understand that. I'm going to have to have some help on the f-stops, and I guess I'd rather have you call them out to me rather than have me try to write them down and jot them on a map and all that jazz.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 50 20 Peterson:</b> Okay; we'll do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 50 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay; thank you. And can you give me a time for passage of Vogel?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 50 30 Peterson:</b> Okay, hang on a minute.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 50 45 Peterson:</b> Okay, it looks like 197:29 is for Vogel. And it'll be a continuous pass from that point on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 50 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay; thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 07 Peterson:</b> Okay, and I have a couple of other updates at 197:14 and 15.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 18 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 19 Peterson:</b> Okay, at 197:14 [197:12], it's Pan Camera, Operate; T-start 197:14:18.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's 197:14:18 [197:12:28] for the Pan Camera to be running. We'll get it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 37 Peterson:</b> Roger. And right now, you're up to that point where you should go Image Motion, Increase, and Pan Camera, Standby, and all that stuff at 197:03 [196:52].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 50 Peterson:</b> Okay; and at 197:15 [197:03], we want Image Motion, Increase.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 51 57 Mattingly:</b> Stand by, please.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 52 02 Peterson:</b> Okay. Standing by.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 52 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 52 38 Peterson:</b> Okay, at 197:15 [197:03], we want Image Motion, Increase, barber pole, plus 3 steps/On.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 52 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Barber pole plus 3 at 15.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 52 56 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 53 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Is that - is that all for about 10 minutes, please?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 53 08 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 53 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p> <a name="196_54_12"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 54 12 Duke:</b> Houston, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 54 13 Peterson:</b> Go ahead, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 54 19 Duke:</b> Okay. I think, looking back at the procedures during the back side pass, I think I've figured out what's wrong with the LM, but I'm not really sure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 54 31 Peterson:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 54 37 Duke:</b> Okay. With the changes from yesterday that were not updated this morning, it looks like to me on Pages 16 and 17 of the Timeline Book, we came out of there with no AC power. Both Inverter breakers are Open.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 52 58 Peterson:</b> Roger; understand. Due to the changes yesterday that were not updated today, on Pages 16 and 17 of the Timeline Book, you came out without AC power.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 55 10 Duke:</b> That's apparently what happened, and I think that the ATCA/PGNS needs AC to fire the jets - but I'm not really - to get the control voltage, but I'm not really positive.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 55 21 Peterson:</b> They're saying here, Charlie, that AC is not required to fire the jets.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 55 28 Duke:</b> Okay. Then that didn't - hmm. Okay. Well, I don't know what happened, then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 55 34 Peterson:</b> Roger. Don't worry about it, Charlie. We're not.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 55 48 Duke:</b> Okay; fine. It's just - disappointing. Except for that one switch, I left everything just like you wanted it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 56 01 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>196 59 55 Peterson:</b> Again, Casper, as a reminder, you should now be about through configuring the camera for orbital science, and we're about two and a half minutes away from the Pan Camera, Operate.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 02 57 Peterson:</b> Casper, we've got a REFSMMAT for you any time you can let us have the computer.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 03 13 Duke:</b> Okay; you got - computer.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 03 19 Peterson:</b> Right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 03 24 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. You have the computer.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 03 27 Peterson:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control, that completes our tape playback we'll continue now to stand by live. Although we haven't gotten confirmation from the crew our telemetry data shows that the sub-satellite has been ejected, from the CSM, from the service module, the SIM bay. And we expect that we will be getting a confirmation from the crew on that also, however at the present time they are quite busy with the cameras on board. And we've been keeping the amount of conversation and the amount of request we've been making on the uplink to a minimum.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 08 51 Peterson:</b> And, Casper; would you go High Gain, Auto.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 15 30 Peterson:</b> 16, Houston. I've got some SPS cue card changes, and have a request on Secondary Propellant Pressure switches Open, if somebody can copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 15 46 Mattingly:</b> Could you wait on that SPS cue card stuff until I get through the photo strip, Don?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 15 51 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 15 52 Mattingly:</b> Will it be too crowded for that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 15 53 Peterson:</b> Negative. I don't think so.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 15 59 Mattingly:</b> Say again, Don.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 16 01 Peterson:</b> We'll hold off. Go ahead with your strip.</p> <a name="197_16_18"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 16 18 Peterson:</b> Okay. Looks like we're about a minute from Boboland [?].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 16 24 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm all set; thank you. And I'm starting with an f/8 and 1/250. And I'll wait for you to tell me when to change settings.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 16 35 Peterson:</b> Roger. We'll do it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 22 54 Mattingly:</b> Don, one of the things that I just noticed in passing Alphonsus is the dark halo craters. And each of those has a little amount of light material inside of the crater itself, just like all the rest of these craters around here. So maybe a dark halo is really an early stage in development.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 23 15 Peterson:</b> Roger. We copy. And in a couple of minutes, Ken, we'll have you go to f/5.6. I'll call you on time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 23 32 Mattingly:</b> Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 24 55 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. In about 15 seconds, you should be north of Bullialdus, and we'll have you go to f/5.6 at that point.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 25 10 Duke:</b> Hey, right now, I'm just passing Lassell C, looking straight down.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 25 14 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 25 56 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. Go to 5.6 as you get up - a beam of Bullialdus.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 26 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Abeam Bullialdus; I'll go to 5.6.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 26 12 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 27 03 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. In about a minute or so, we'll be up by Helmet. And, at that time, we'll want to change the shutter to 1/125.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 27 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 28 10 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. Looks good on 1/125 on the shutter, and you should be coming up by Helmet pretty soon now.</p> <a name="197_29"></a>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control at 197 hours, 41 minutes [197:29]. Our Return to Earth Officer is in the process of computing a preliminary set of numbers for the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver, That maneuver will start Apollo 16 on its way back to Earth [and] is scheduled to start at 200 hours, 33 minutes [and] 20 seconds [200:21:30] Ground Elapsed Time. And the burn will be performed with the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine will be about a 2 minute, 50 second maneuver. And with the completion of that burn a splashdown time will be set at 266 hours, 2 minutes [and] 7 seconds. That time is subject to change a little bit but the time of Entry Interface will be quite fixed once the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver has been performed. We also have some times for Acquisition of Signal with and without the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. If the burn is performed as planned, the Acquisition of Signal time as Apollo 16 comes around from behind the Moon after performing the burn will be 200 hours, 43 minutes [and] 10 seconds [200:31:20]. If for some reason the burn is not performed as scheduled on the 65 revolution, the Acquisition of Signal time will be 200 hours, 52 minutes [and] 50 seconds [200:41:00]. Looking a little farther down the Flight Plan, the time now for Mid-Course Correction Number 5 is 217 hours, 34 minutes. And the time for the CSM EVA is 221 hours, 5 minutes. Correction on that the - yes, that would be hatch open [at] 221 hours, 5 minutes for hatch open, and hatch closed at 222 hours, 15 minutes. In Central Standard Time that would compute to 4:47 pm Central Standard Time the hatch open and 5:57 pm central standard time for the hatch closed. And again the splashdown time that we are looking toward is 266 hours, 2 minutes 7 seconds. We expect that that number will probably be updated somewhat following the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. Apollo 16 at the present time is in an orbit with a high point or apocynthion of 66.5 nautical miles and a low point above the lunar surface of 52.4 nautical miles.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. We would like to point out that these numbers that were just passed along for such events as TEI, the Mid-Course Correction, the Trans-Earth EVA and splashdown all do not take into account the fact that we are expecting to do a clock update. That clock update will move the clock ahead about 21 hours [and] 50 minutes. That 21 hours [and] 50 minutes will have to be added to the times that we have given - to the GET times that we have given, in order to keep them in sync with the time we'll be using in Mission Control once the GET update has been done. We still haven't settled precisely on when that update will be made. The primary purpose for it is to bring the clocks into synchronization with the Flight Plan. At this point there are two things we can do. We can either go through the Flight Plan as we have been doing up to now and changing all of the times that are in the Flight Plan to make them agree with the clock or, and this is a more simple procedure, we can simply change the clock to make it agree with the times that are already in the Flight Plan. This eliminates a great deal of changes that have to be made to the Flight Plan and will be done at a convenient point. However, just when that point will be reached we haven't decided on yet. It will be sometime after the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. The Central Standard Times, of course, are not affected and they will remain the same for the hatch open, hatch close. Again, that Central Standard Time for the Trans-Earth EVA hatch open is 4:47 pm Central Standard Time [and] hatch close 5:57 pm Central Standard Time. The playing that we do with the clocks here in the control center and on the spacecraft will not affect those Central Standard Times.</p> <a name="197_37"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 37 32 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. We show Pan Camera T-stop now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 37 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And it's in Standby. I've completed the photo strip. I have 160 frames on magazine RR. And magazine Victor, I finished it off with, and it now has 160 frames showing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 38 01 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand 160 frames on RR and on Victor. We'll also go Mapping Camera, Off, now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 38 16 Peterson:</b> And on she Mapping Camera -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 38 17 Mattingly:</b> It's Off.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>197 38 31 Peterson:</b> Okay. And you can go Pan Camera, Off, now. And you can go Laser Altimeter, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 38 46 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The Laser's Off. The Pan Power's Off. And I'm going to Standby on the mapper.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 38 52 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>197 42 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The jets are configured.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 42 09 Peterson:</b> Okay. We need to go to Block on the computer. And, Ken, it looks like that circ flag has not been set. I'm sorry; it's set. It needs to be reset.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 42 27 Mattingly:</b> You :mean - you mean the numbers, Verb 45?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 42 33 Peterson:</b> Stand by a minute. Verb 45, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 42 54 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. And we've got one note on the Service Module RCS system. I got a TEI pad, couple more changes to the Flight Plan, and a SPS cue card change for you. And you can copy them in any order you want.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 44 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let's start with your RCS notes. And then following that, let's take the Flight Plan, and the - I think - Let's take the RCS, the cue card, the Flight Plan, and finally the pads.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 44 30 Peterson:</b> Okay. The RCS note is we want the Service Module RCS Secondary Propellant Pressure switches, four, Open. And that's to prevent the primary fuel tank depletion during TEI.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 44 47 Mattingly:</b> Don, did you copy?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 44 54 Peterson:</b> Roger, Ken. I copied you. And I had started reading there on the RCS note. Did you read that?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 45 02 Mattingly:</b> No, sir. I hadn't [garble]...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 45 03 Young:</b> No, we missed you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 45 07 Peterson:</b> Okay. I'll - I'll try it again here. The Service Module RCS Secondary Propellant Fuel Pressure switches, four, Open. And the purpose for that is to prevent primary tank fuel tank depletions during TEI.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 45 31 Young:</b> Do that right now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 45 36 Peterson:</b> Stand by one. That's affirmative. That's affirmative. We want to go ahead and do it now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 45 58 Young:</b> Got four, Open.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 46 02 Peterson:</b> Okay. Now the SPS cue card. Let me know when you're ready to copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 46 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. Go ahead. And why don't you give me an outline of what is first, so I have some idea of what to do, and then I'll work on the card. We can go back and do it in detail.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 46 24 Peterson:</b> Okay. First of all, about a third of the way down the page, we've got a note on the - on PNGS operation for TEI, and then we've got a couple or three words to add down about nine lines from the bottom on the gimbal trim and verify manual thrust vector control. And we're gonna say there, "Except Yaw." And seven lines from the bottom, we're going to have you open the Pitch 2 and Yaw 2 Battery B circuit breakers to keep the Secondary system from getting an - or sensing an overcurrent and shutting itself down. And on the back of the card, we're going to reclose those two circuit breakers after the Delta-V Thrust Stop.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 47 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Is there some reason you think that we need that added protection this time?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 47 19 Peterson:</b> I guess it's just a feeling that if you get into TEI and you lose the primary system and you're on the Secondary system, you don't want the Secondary system to - to sense an overcurrent and shut down. And we're gonna pull these circuit breakers to make sure that that control system continues to function.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>197 47 4l Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's always the case. I just wondered if there was some reason that you were suspicious that might be more appropriate thing to say this time.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. We lost radio contact with Apollo 16 while John Young was in the process of reading back those numbers. The numbers that he was reading back to us are the preliminary numbers that will be used for the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. That maneuver occurs at a Ground Elapsed Time of 200 hours, 33 minutes [and] 21 seconds. And, it will be performed using the spacecraft Service Propulsion System engine [and] the primary guidance and navigation system. It comes at the very end of the 64th revolution while the spacecraft is behind the Moon. We'll get our first report on the outcome of the maneuver as the spacecraft comes into acquisition on the 65th revolution of the Moon. The total velocity change is predicted at this point to be 3,371 feet per second and that will be achieved by burning the Service Propulsion System engine for 2 minutes, 42 seconds. With that burn performed nominally we would predict a time of entry interface of 265 hours, 49 minutes [and] 12 seconds leading us to that splashdown time of 266 hours, 2 minutes [and] 7 seconds. The amount of time the spacecraft spends on the chutes after entry interface seems to be a little bit more variable than the time of entry interface. But, those times should not change a great deal given a nominal SPS Trans-Earth Injection maneuver. We'll be reacquiring Apollo 16 in 42 minutes as the spacecraft went around the corner of the Moon we were showing an orbit of 66.6 nautical miles by 52.6. At 198 hours, 11 minutes; this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>198 53 10 Roosa(?):</b> And, Ken, have you got a couple of minutes to listen to a few words about servo loop.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 53 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Go right ahead, Stu.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 53 21 Roosa:</b> Okay. That's a real good system you've got on your second loop. We have got the simulator swinging right with the characteristics of your spacecraft. And this is the way it's going to look to you if you have to use it. Prior to ignition, the gimbal is going to be oscillating plus or minus - approximate - at about a degree - 0.9 - something like that or, in other words, 1.8 peak to peak. But once you get Thrust On, there's a side load on your bell from the LOI burn, and this side load acts as a damper. Since the load is cyclic, it really doesn't matter which direction the load is; it damps out. Under CMC control, it will damp out in a few seconds and burn very steady. In SCS, Auto, it damps almost immediately and then is steady throughout the rest of the burn. In Rate Command, however, since you're continually pulsing it with an input, it continues to oscillate pretty much at this same magnitude, or amplitude, throughout the burn. However, as far as you controlling it, it really doesn't matter. However, sitting in the simulators we don't get the real live shake effect that you're going to get. The spacecraft is going to shake and shudder; however, your attitude will remain virtually unchanged. And, I guess, the only advice that I could say would be that if you download - if you could go to SCS, Auto, you would save those excessive clutch currents that you get under Rate Command with this continual oscillation. And I guess I'll stop there, if you've got any questions.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 55 26 Mattingly:</b> No, that sounds - that's good information, Stu. I'm glad to hear that. Do you - you got any cute tricks in the back of your mind on how you can download from Rate Command and then go back to Auto without getting a big transient due to the mistrims?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 55 45 Roosa:</b> No. I - I think - now I tried it - purposely having at least, say, a degree mistrim and - when I would switch, and you'll get the transient, but the bell will - will steady out. Now, I think going ahead and flying it in Rate Command is - is acceptable; however, you are - you are getting the bell oscillating, and you are putting, you know, the currents through there. This attitude...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 56 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I get the - Sounds like - if you could - you could damp the rates - damp the oscillations quickly by getting it into Rate Command - I mean the - Auto and then use the old thumbwheel procedure to change the pointing accuracy if you aren't pointing in the right direction.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 56 44 Roosa:</b> Yeah. You - you don't have much control with that - with that thumbwheel in - in the Auto. I think, probably, I would take it in Rate Command, go back to my attitude, recycle my BMAGs, uncage them again at my - at the attitude I wanted, and then accept the trim - the mistrim in the - in the gimbal and - and let that damp out. I think you're going to be hard put to try to guess - guess your thumbwheel setting. However, let us think about that a little bit; and, also, I'd like to say this has been checked. I talked with North American this afternoon. This all agrees with the hardware evaluator, as far as our characteristics, so I think we're pretty close to your spacecraft.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 57 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's outstanding. Sounds like you guys have done a mighty thorough job. My first choice then would be to - I think, based on what you said right now, just do the natural thing and take the oscillations unless they're excessive, and look - just download in the normal manner and ride it out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 58 01 Roosa:</b> Okay. That sounds - I think that's very ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 58 03 Mattingly:</b> So, as the first choice, I think we'll do the normal thing and burn CMC.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 58 12 Roosa:</b> By all means, yes. CMC is - is prime, or you can - you can download ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 58 15 Mattingly:</b> Yes, okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 58 16 Roosa:</b> ... You'll be in Rate Command, and you will have the bell shaking. It'll start to damp a little bit; but every time you hit with an impulse, why, you'll excite the oscillation again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>198 58 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you very much, Stu.</p>

That was Astronaut Stuart Roosa who has been running a number of simulations in the simulators here at the Manned Spacecraft Center reproducing the problem that has existed in the thrust vector control in the Apollo 16 backup guidance system. He was going through with Ken Mattingly what the crew on Apollo 16 -</p>

      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. Our spacecraft communicator for the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver will be astronaut Don Peterson. He is accompanied at the Capcom console by astronaut Stu Roosa, who a few moments ago was discussing with Ken Mattingly from his experience in the simulators what Mattingly and the crew of Apollo 16 should experience. If for some reason they had to switch over to the backup guidance system to control this Trans-Earth Injection maneuver, with the problem that they have had with the thrust vector control, how that system would control, and what they should expect to see and feel. In essence, Roosa's comments, from operating with a similar system in the simulator, were that the backup system should control very well. But there will be some oscillations due to the oscillation in one of the two axis of control of the thrust vector control system which transmits the commands to the SPS engine bell that gimbal it from side to side and up and down. In the yaw direction there are some oscillations in the backup control mode. However, Roosa found that with a precise sort of a set up that the Apollo 16 spacecraft has, and what he described as some sideloads that are characteristic of the way this engine is burning. It will damp out most of the oscillation shortly after the engine ignites, and would control properly, and would control the burn very well. This again, we'd reiterate, is a backup control system from everything that we've seen on the primary control system is expected to function normally and give the same excellent account of itself that it has in previous burns. The advice to Ken Mattingly, in the event that there is some unforeseen problem with the primary control system, is that he would go on around, not perform the burn, let us take a look at the primary system back on the frontside of the Moon. See if there would be any way of restoring that, and if not, the burn would be performed with the backup system which we would also expect to do a very good job of controlling the maneuver.</p>

And they were virtually unchanged from the preliminary which were read up on the previous revolution, the time of ignition remains the same 200:33 21 seconds, the total velocity change 3,370.9 feet per second and the burn duration is unchanged 2 minutes 42 seconds, and the time of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere also unchanged, [at] 265:49:12 seconds. We have about 45 minutes remaining before we lose radio contact with Apollo 16, on this revolution. When next we reacquire radio contact with the spacecraft they'll be at the start of their 65th revolution and should be on their way back to Earth.</p> <a name="199_10_54"></a>

      <p class="pao" <b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> Apollo 16 at the present time is passing over the Descartes landing site for the final time on this mission. We have about 38 minutes now until we lose radio contact on this revolution.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 17 18 Peterson:</b> 16, I've got about four more updates to the Flight Plan, any time you want to copy. At about 200 hours and 43 minutes is the first one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 17 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 17 35 Peterson:</b> Okay. There's a list of items at 200 hours and 43 minutes, and we want to add to that list "Pan Camera V over H override to high altitude."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 17 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Pan Camera V over H to high.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 17 56 Peterson:</b> And at 200 hours 46 minutes, we want to change from "Barber pole plus three steps," to "Barber pole plus two steps."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 18 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. That's plus two.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 18 12 Peterson:</b> Roger. And at 200 hours and 56 minutes, we want to change from "Gamma Ray, Deploy" to read "Gamma Ray, Deploy to 8 feet," and that's "59 seconds."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 18 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Gamma Ray, Deploy at 8 feet, 59 seconds.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 18 40 Peterson:</b> Okay. And at 201:082 we've got "Maneuver angles to Moon UV attitude are roll, 174; pitch, 212; yaw, 64; and the High Gain Antenna angles are Pitch, minus 73; and Yaw, 12."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 19 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay; 174, 212, and 064 for the attitude, and High Gain, minus 73 and 12.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 19 18 Peterson:</b> Readback correct, and that's all the Flight Plan updates we've got right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 19 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Don. Down here where it says "Pan Camera, Mapping Camera film should be expended," I'm gonna let those things run until you guys tell us that you're either tired of taking pictures or something, because we're not going to run out, I don't imagine - at least not at this point.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 19 44 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. Understand the Pan Camera will probably run out, but the Mapping Camera may take quite awhile.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 19 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I suspect it's probably to our advantage, even though the cutter works good, that we probably ought to go ahead and run it out. That's your call though.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 20 05 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. I think that's what we plan to do.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 20 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 20 22 Peterson:</b> And, 16, it'll take about 3 hours to get rid of that mapping camera film, if we run it all the way out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 20 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Is that what you want to do or did you want to just go ahead and cut it tomorrow? It's no difference to us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 20 39 Peterson:</b> We'll let it run out, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 20 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 10 Peterson:</b> 16, can you verify that the sub-satellite deployed on time?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 18 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. Sure can.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 21 Peterson:</b> [Garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 23 Young:</b> How's it doing?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 38 Peterson:</b> Okay. I guess we're not able to see it until the LM electrical power runs out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 26 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. It went on time. Of course, it was in the dark and we couldn't see it to verify it visually, but - all indications were that everything was a normal deployment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 57 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 05 Mattingly:</b> And you can tell all our friendly G&Cs there, Don, that I don't understand it, but in 100 seconds, EMS now only shows a 0.2 change, which looks like the EMS gets better as time goes on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 18 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand you think the EMS is getting smarter.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> That was Ken Mattingly reporting that the sub-satellite was launched from its position in the Scientific Instrument Module bay of Apollo 16 on time. The connection between the Lunar Module batteries and our ability to turn on the sub-satellite [to] begin receiving data from it is that the Lunar Module and the sub-satellite operate on the same frequency. The Lunar Module, of course, is no longer - we're no longer able to command it. It will not be impacted into the lunar surface; however, its communication system is still functioning and it is still putting out radio frequency energy - still transmitting and for that reason we're not able to activate the sub-satellite begin receiving data from it. This will continue until the Lunar Module batteries go dead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 30 38 Mattingly:</b> Houston, is it okay for 16 to go to the burn attitude?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 30 43 Peterson:</b> Stand by one. Okay, 16. You can go to burn attitude.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 30 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 32 03 Peterson:</b> 16, would you verify Limit Cycle switch, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 32 10 Mattingly:</b> No. As a matter of a fact, it's on right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 32 16 Peterson:</b> Okay. We'd like to have that switch Off, please.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 33 07 Peterson:</b> And, 16, we'd also like you to verify once more, although we're sure you're going to do it this way anyway, that you're going to leave the Optics Power switch on during the burn, because that will decrease the probability of the - of the glitch occurring.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 33 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I didn't realize that it would. We would have left it on, but thank you for telling us.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 33 31 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo control. A few moments ago Ken Mattingly reported the spacecraft was beginning to maneuver to the proper attitude for the Trans-Earth Injection burn. We expect when they do that we'll momentarily lose lock on with the High Gain Antenna. In fact, we are hearing a bit of increase in the noise level now and we just had break in the lock. We'll be reacquiring [and] should have a good solid lock up again shortly. In the mean time we'll continue to have rather noisy communications between the ground and the spacecraft. And communications controller here INCO reports that we should be locking up shortly on an Omni antenna. And we've just done hat. We've got good solid lock on now. As an additional note of interest on the interference problem that we're having with the Lunar Module transmitter which is as we said on the same frequency as the sub-satellite. We're predicting that the LM batteries will die at about 211 hours ground elapsed time give or take an hour and a half. So at about 211 hours we should be able then to command the sub-satellite and to begin receiving data from it. Now there is a small possibility that we'll get a lock on the Lunar Module for a long enough period of time that we can command it to shift frequency so that we no longer have the interference problem. However, as soon as the LM breaks lock it will again revert to the original frequency so this would only be a temporary assist in the problem. And, until 211 hours plus or minus an hour and a half we don't expect to be getting any consistent data from the sub-satellite. We' re showing now 19 minutes, 25 seconds until we lose radio contact with Casper. As the spacecraft goes around the corner behind the Moon it should be in the proper attitude for the burn and flight controllers here will be getting a last look at all the systems and we'll be giving the Apollo 16 crew [the] Go for Trans-Earth Injection.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 40 01 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. I've got those camera settings for after TEI. Can you tell me you're ready to copy?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 40 12 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 40 14 Peterson:</b> Okay. For the first 15 degrees past the terminator, the settings are 5.6, 1 over 125, and infinity; from 15 degrees to 30 degrees, it's 5.6, 1 over 250, and infinity; and past 30 degrees, it's 8, 1 over 250, and infinity.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 40 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you, Don. The first 15 degrees, it's 5.6, 1/125; and, from 15 to 30, it's 1/250; and, from 30 on, it's f/8 and then 1/250. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 41 00 Peterson:</b> Roger. And just a couple of additional comments here. The P20 attitude is going to differ slightly from what you've got in the Flight Plan, due to the fact; that we're using a different TEI REFSMMAT. It's a very small change and probably not very significant. But we didn't want it to surprise you. And the TEI rev is different, of course. That's going to give us a slightly different terminator, so we've been advised that you can turn the Mapping Camera and the Pan Camera on a couple or three minutes early, if you'd like since we got a lot of film.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 41 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We'll put those things on as soon as it's practical. And you - did you want to change the Noun 78 load, or are you just saying that that will give us a different set of gimbal angles?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 41 53 Peterson:</b> The Noun 78 load is correct, it'll just give you a slightly different set of gimbal angles.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 42 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 42 02 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 42 09 Mattingly:</b> And the 509 flag is set.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 42 13 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>199 50 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Houston. We have a successful star check.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 50 36 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand successful star check.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 50 42 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="pao"></b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> Ken Mattingly has reported a successful star check[. That] is an indication that the spacecraft is in the proper attitude for the Trans-Earth Injection burn. We're now 4 minutes, 22 seconds away from loss of radio contact with Apollo 16. When next we reacquire spacecraft and crew should be on route back to Earth. With a good TEI burn we would expect to reacquire Apollo 16 at 200 hours, 43 minutes [and] 10 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. If for some reason the burn is not performed on this revolution we would reacquire at 200 hours, 52 minutes [and] 50 seconds. The spacecraft weight prior to that 2 minutes, 42 second burn of the Service Propulsion System is predicted to be 38,232 pounds. Following the burn it will be 27,487 pounds. The difference of 10,845 pounds being in the propellant that'll be consumed in that 2 minute, 42 second burn. At the time of the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver the Lunar Module will be about 16 miles behind Casper - the Command and Service Module - and about one mile above. We're now three minutes away from loss of radio contact.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>199 54 31 Peterson:</b> About 45 seconds to LOS. See you coming home.</p>

      <p class="ed">[Loss Of Signal at about 199:55.]</p>
      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> Apollo 16 [is] now behind the Moon out of radio contact [and] 26 minutes away from the 2 minutes, 42 second burn that will start them on their way back to Earth. About 45 seconds prior to loss of radio contact Capcom Don Peterson advised the crew that we were coming up on loss of con - loss of signal and said "see you on your way home", and we got a terse roger from John Young at that point. Again, those time of acquisition with a normal Trans-Earth Injection burn 200 hours, 43 minutes [and] 10 seconds, [and] without the burn 200 hours, 52 minutes [and] 50 seconds. And, when we reacquire Apollo 16 they should be moving rapidly away from the Lunar surface. From the Apollo 10 mission where we had television of that particular portion of the mission we recall [a] very spectacular view of the Lunar surface out the window of the spacecraft. The Moon dropping rapidly away and shrinking rapidly in size. At 200 hours, 8 minutes [and] 38 seconds this is Apollo Control, Houston.</p> <a name="200_13_54"></a>

      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. Now one minute, 30 seconds from reacquiring Apollo 16. Should the spacecraft for some reason not have burned it's Trans-Earth Injection maneuver we will be reacquiring in about 11 minutes. This burn with the Service Propulsion System engine was to be a 2 minute, 42 second burn producing a total change in velocity of some 3,371 feet per second, increasing the speed of Casper from 3,600 nautical - rather 3,600 statute miles an hour to about 5,900 statute miles per hour. In the course of this 2 minute, 42 second burn the Service Propulsion System engine would consume some 10,845 pounds of propellant. One of the things that's accomplished with the Trans-Earth Injection maneuver; and of course the prime objective, starting the spacecraft on its trajectory back to Earth. Well, also with this maneuver we set the splashdown time. From that point on there are minor corrections to the trajectory primarily to control the entry interface angle which is set at negative 6.51 degrees. Correction, negative 7.37 degrees. And with no problems of weather, and what we would have to change weather- Now we've just gotten the call of Acquisition of Signal right on time. We should be getting the first words from the crew. We're waiting for the antennas to lock up and communications are still quite noisy.</p> <a name="200_31"></a>

      <p class="obcm"><b>200 32 28 Young (onboard):</b> Well, what did - what did you set it to on this, Ken ?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 32 30 Mattingly (onboard):</b> On what?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 32 31 Young (onboard):</b> This camera.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>200 32 33 Young (onboard):</b> [Garble] the Earth, and then me.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 32 36 Mattingly (onboard):</b> 1/250, f/8.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 32 41 Duke:</b> There's Omni Delta.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b> Public Affairs Officer: </b> John Young, and Charlie Duke with the reactions very similar to what we've seen from previous crews as the spacecraft moves out very rapidly from the Lunar surface.

The spacecraft velocity now is 7,957 feet per second.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>200 33 47 Young (onboard):</b> You have the burn status report, Charlie?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 33 48 Duke (onboard):</b> Yeah, it's out.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 33 50 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Okay, would you put the Mapping Camera to On?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 33 52 Duke (onboard):</b> Mapping Camera's going On, right.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>200 34 21 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Then I'll get one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 34 22 Young:</b> Okay, Houston. We're working some mapping stuff. The burn was completed nominal. We'll give you the status report in - just as soon as we finish.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> That was John Young reporting [that] the burn was completely nominal.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>200 34 36 Young (onboard):</b> Wonder if I can get that DAC on this thing.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>200 34 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Yeah, why don't you get the status report; I'll try to get the DAC going.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>200 55 30 Mattingly:</b> I guess in SIM bay attitude, the only thing we have been able to see so far is Sea of Kovalsky, and Charlie said he got a view of it out his window.

      <p class="tech"><b>200 55 50 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 55 53 Mattingly:</b> That's the whole Moon out - out a window. Back from it about two inches.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>200 56 30 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> And here in the Control Center, the Flight Dynamics Officer just confirmed John Young's reports from on board the spacecraft that that burn was almost precisely as planned. With a very small midcourse correction requirement showing at this time.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 56 55 Mattingly:</b> From this distance, the color is very much the same as it was when we were orbiting it. And that is that no three men on any one crew can agree on what the color really is.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 57 10 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 57 l4 Duke:</b> Looks like to me, Pete, that the mare right now just picked up a bluish-black cast to them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 57 21 Young:</b> Charlie, these maria are brownish-black casts.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 57 24 Duke:</b> John says brownish.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 57 27 Peterson:</b> Roger. Understand a bluish-brownish black cast. You guys have invented a new one this time, anyway.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 57 33 Duke:</b> That's right. We'll get Ken's opinion. Standby.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>200 59 59 Duke:</b> Pete, did CST come back with anything on those wrist rings?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 00 06 Peterson:</b> Stand by one, Charlie. We'll check on it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 00 32 Young:</b> You know, as we move out from the Moon, I think that by looking at the varied structures on the surface, that we can see from here, I guess my impression of it is that the Moon may be 4 billion years old plus, but it sure had a - and it may eventually have stopped growing after the first 500 million or changing dynamically, like the Earth changes, but during that first 500 million years, it was certainly busy cause it really has a lot of variety down there, and we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of com - complexity of the story. That's my personal opinion.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 0l 20 Peterson:</b> Roger. Charlie, on the problem with the rings, I guess we don't really have an answer for you, and we may get some more in the morning. But there's no apparent good way to do anything about that. We don't have a cleansing agent or a lubricant that we can use on them. I guess you'll just have to use more force on them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 0l 45 Duke:</b> Fine. With - we can get them locked with a little force, and they pass checks okay, once we get them on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 01 53 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> The ring that Charlie Duke was asking about is the glove lock ring. The problem that he described is in getting the gloves locked onto the suit and you heard him say that it does take some force to do it, but once they get it done, and get the gloves locked in place they're maintaining a good seal and the suit is passing suit integrity check alright. The recommendation, from Capcom Don Peterson, was that there is little we can do about cleaning the grit out of those wrist locks. They looked into the possibility of perhaps pouring water into them but they felt that that would only turn the dirt that's in there to mud and would really not improve the situation any. So the crew was advised to leave them as they are and apply the necessary force to get them locked. It appears that this will cause no problem. Apollo 16 at the moment is 1,766 nautical miles from the Moon continuing to climb out rapidly, although the velocity is dropping off, down now to 6,245 feet per second. And about 12 hours from now or at 212:53:36 seconds the spacecraft will again cross that mythical line we call the Lunar sphere of influence. At that point they will be under the dominant effect of Earth's gravity. We'll have our displays switched over from Moon reference to Earth reference and we'll begin seeing Apollo 16 accelerating toward Earth.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>201 14 08 Peterson:</b> Okay, Ken. I wouldn't bother updating the time very much further because you're going to do a clock resync here at 202:20 [202:08].</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>201 14 36 Mattingly:</b> All right sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 14 37 Peterson:</b> ... going by the old numbers where it was 224:18 or so, which is now about 202:25 [202:13]or so, we want to delete that Verb 49 maneuver. And at 202:25 [202:13] or thereabouts, we will resync the clocks, and that'll bring you up - the clock'll come 226:30, so we'll pick up with the nominal Flight Plan, which will have you going to bed a couple hours earlier tonight.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 15 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Very good. Thank you, sir. Okay, and then what do we do about this - can we do our PTC REFSMMAT change at the same time we're in this attitude?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>201 16 30 Mattingly:</b> I guess the question - I'm not sure if we got the right question and answer together. Can we do the PTC REFSMMAT platform change in the Sco X-1 attitude? Maybe that's the question you answered, I'm not sure.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>201 16 56 Peterson:</b> 16, the answer to that apparently is yes, but you will wind up with a 68-degree gimbal angle.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>201 17 25 Peterson:</b> Oh, 16, if the 68-degree middle gimbal angle is acceptable to you, we would like for you to go ahead and press on with it.</p>

And the clock update will amount to 24 minutes, 34 seconds - or 34 minutes - We'll try that again - 24 hours, 34 minutes, 12 seconds and at 202 hours, 30 minutes [202:18], or about 16 minutes from now that update will be entered into the clocks here in the Control Center and also into the clocks aboard the spacecraft. Faced with the problem with correcting flight plans all the way to - Here's a call from the crew - we'll pick that up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 04 52 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16; if you'll go Accept, we'll uplink this clock sync. And while they're doing that, I'll tell you kind of what's going to happen. But - We're going to do it. The total change will be 24 hours 34 minutes and 12 seconds. And what we would like you to do is on, let's see here, Page 338 in the Flight Plan, we'd like you to pick up at about 226:30 in the Flight Plan ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 05 22 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Don, (laughter) I'm sorry you're gonna - Hey, Don, you're gonna have to start over again. Just as you started talking, our cabin fan let out a great big moan, and so we turned it off then, after all sitting up straight to see what it was. So would you start over again?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 05 41 Peterson:</b> Okay, I'll do that. If you'll go Accept, we've got the clock sync ready to go, and it'll be a 24 hour 34 minute and 12 second total change in the clocks. And what we would like you to do is pick up the Flight Plan at the old - at the old point of 226:30, actually pick up those events, although your clock may not come out exactly on that time. And what we're saying is we may cut a little bit into your rest period.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 06 12 Mattingly:</b> Okay; but we're planning to do a little stowage here that we never have had a chance to get done.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 06 19 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 06 20 Mattingly:</b> So we're going to have to do some of that stuff now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 06 23 Peterson:</b> Okay. The items we'll pick up with, I guess, are the ones immediately following 226:30 [201:55]in the old Flight Plan.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 06 35 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 07 17 Peterson:</b> Okay. Ken, your clock should be changed now. And if you'll pick up with - on Page 338 where it says, "Gamma Ray, Shield Off," you can go ahead and finish that stuff up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 07 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I take it we're gonna hold off on this PTC for a while until you've had enough time in this attitude?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 07 40 Peterson:</b> Stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 07 53 Peterson:</b> Roger. We'd like to stay away from the PTC for about 15 more minutes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 08 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay; we'll do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 09 32 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. We'd like you to close the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover now, but we want to leave the X-Ray on for an extra 30 minutes because we failed to get some calibration data, and I'll call you when it should go off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 l0 52 Peterson:</b> 16, did you copy on the Alpha Particle/X-Ray Cover?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 11 03 Duke:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 11 05 Peterson:</b> Okay. We want to get that closed and leave the X-Ray on, and I'll call you when it should go off. About a half hour from now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 11 15 Duke:</b> Okay, I closed the cover.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>202 11 54 Peterson:</b> Stand by one; we'll take a look at it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 12 01 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. That looks good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 12 04 Young:</b> That's three balls 11, okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 13 03 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. On those numbers you've got on the DSKY there, if you'll go to the G&N Checklist, Page 9-4, you can load Register 2 and 3 in column Bravo, Lines 4 and 5.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 13 26 Duke:</b> Okay, G&N Checklist, 9-4, what - load what?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 13 30 Peterson:</b> Load Register 2 and 3 in column Bravo, line 4 and 5.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>202 13 47 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control. We have now completed the clock sync and update, synchronizing the clock aboard the spacecraft and the clocks here in Mission Control with an updated time, advancing them 24 hours, 34 minutes [and] 12 seconds. Faced with the choice of making the Flight Plan agree with reality would require updating events item by item to account for the difference in time introduced when the LM landing was delayed and the subsequent early departure for Earth, or making reality in effect agree with the Flight Plan we've chosen to do the later. Which means that we moved the clocks ahead 24 hours, 34 minutes and 12 seconds. And having completed that we're in effect back on the normal Flight Plan. At present time our clock reads 227 hours, 11 minutes 20 seconds . And at this point in the Flight Plan the crew will be preparing for their rest period. We've asked them to go back and pick up items about 30 minutes prior to that. Which includes putting the spacecraft in the Passive Thermal Control mode, rotating it about its longitudinal axis at the rate of 3 revolutions per hour to maintain the proper temperature equilibrium. Completing that they'll then begin their pre-sleep checklist and probably begin the rest period around 227:30 [202:44] although we expect that they will be a little late getting to this. And will begin the sleep period probably 30 to 45 minutes after that. That's somewhere around 228 to 228:30. In making this clock update it should now eliminate the need for most of the Flight Plan updates that we have been forced to make for the last several days. The clocks now agree with where we should be in the Flight Plan. An arbitrary change keeps all of the sequences as they should be and the intervals between the events where they should be. And we'll also have another clock with a nomenclature TV 5, which would be viewable on the - on the monitors in the news center, which is counting the actual ground elapsed time. Which is 202 hours, 17 minutes. But [the] time that is in sequence with the Flight Plan is the updated time, which now reads 227 hours 3 minutes. This time by the way, is arrived at by taking the Flight Plan time for Entry Interface and subtracting the predicted Entry Interface time, using the original or the older GET, the previous GET before we updated, then subtracting the Entry Interface time that we would have with our previous GET or Ground Elapsed Time, from the Entry Interface time that is showing on the Flight Plan. Now we come up with the difference in time, which is taken care of in the clock update of 24 hours, 34 minutes and 12 seconds. This then is the time that is used for the clock update. And as mentioned previously, we are now more or less back on the nominal Flight Plan. Now there would be several minor changes, but nothing like the number of changes that we have been experiencing for the last several days.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>202 59 32 Peterson:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. We're standing by now to receive television from the Command Module. Again to reiterate the situation as far as the TV goes. Charlie Duke reported being very impressed with the view of the Lunar surface from an altitude of some 7,000 nautical miles, [and] requested that we get things set up on the ground to receive TV. Fortunately we were in fact set to do that but not from the Command Module. We were planning to turn on the camera aboard the [Lunar] Rover on the lunar surface at 11 pm Central Standard Time. Consequently, the lines between Goldstone, which is the Manned Spaceflight Network station on which we were to receive the television from the Lunar surface - those lines were up and we were ready to go when we got the word from Charlie Duke that he was planning to turn on the television camera. So, we should be in good shape to receive a color picture from the Command Module of the Lunar surface. The plan as far as the television that we were going to get from the Rover is simply to delay that until the crew has completed the television transmission that their planning and then to pick up television from the Lunar surface. At the present time Apollo 16 is 7,697 nautical miles from the Moon travelling at a speed of 4,951 feet per second, and we're standing by for [a] television picture. Flight Director Pete Frank estimates that it would take the crew about five minutes to get the camera out and in operation.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 02 27 Duke:</b> Pete, could we take the S-Band Aux switch out of SCI to get the - monitor set up?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>203 03 11 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. We need to get the Mapping Camera, Off - Stand by. Get the Mapping Camera to Standby, and the Gamma Ray, shield on, prior to going out of the SCI position.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 03 30 Duke:</b> Okay. The camera has retracted. We're gonna go to Off on the Mapping Camera, and the gam - and the shield is on.</p>

And we were - then all I saw out the window was the MESA blanket; then we were back on the gages.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 12 15 Peterson:</b> Roger. It looked like you lifted out of there pretty rapidly.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>203 19 46 Peterson:</b> Oh yeah, we can see that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 19 47 Young:</b> See that? Can you see the dirt under those fingernails - can you see the dirt under those fingernails?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 19 52 Peterson:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 19 53 Young:</b> That's Moon dust. You talk about a - you talk about two dirty human beings. It took 10 minutes before we could get Ken to open the door. As soon as he saw us, he wanted to close it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 20 09 Peterson:</b> Roger. We understand. He runs a neat ship.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 20 12 Young:</b> And we're still that way. Yeah, wait'll you see some of these rocks. And we've - and some of the data that Ken's got. That's really something. The Moon around Alphonsus. I got a chance to look at it today for the first time, and - it's really - it's really a strange place. How's everybody doing down there at MCC. Is everybody starting to take it easy for a change?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 20 45 Peterson:</b> Oh, I think we're all breathing easy now. And if we can, we'd like to get a quick look at the CMP because we're going to have to give up the lines here in a couple of minutes.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>203 23 22 Peterson:</b> No. I guess we don't have anything going on right now, Charlie. Everything's routine. If you want a news report, we can dig one up, I think.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 23 37 Duke:</b> No, it's not important. Wondered what - We haven't had an update for a while; y'all must have ran out of paper.</p>
      <p class="ed">[End of short CM Transcript.]</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. That unscheduled TV transmission of the Moon and the interior of the Command Module lasted for about 15 minutes and it showed us the surface of the Moon from about 8,000 nautical miles. Now the crew will shortly be putting the spacecraft into the slow rotation and on its Passive Thermal Control or the Passive Thermal Control mode. And we hope before too much longer they'll be getting ready to begin their rest period.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. We're now getting ready to bring up the camera aboard the rover at Cayley Plain Descartes site. And expect to have the camera in operation for about 30 minutes. We have about 10 minutes acquisition time remaining with the 210 foot dish antenna at Goldstone, California. We'll then be handing over to one of the 85 foot antenna sites for the remainder of the 30 minutes that we expect to get television from the lunar surface.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 29 04 Young:</b> How does the midcourse look, Pete?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 29 10 Peterson:</b> Stand - stand by one.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 29 28 Peterson:</b> Okay, 16. All we have is the G&N data. We don't have tracking data because you are uncoupled. However, based on the G&N data, it looks like less than one foot per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 29 42 Young:</b> Yeah; but - course, I - Yeah, I forgot us - about us being uncoupled.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 29 51 Peterson:</b> Doesn't look like anything very big. About a foot per second.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 29 56 Young:</b> Yeah. Well - I - the G&N - thought it did a good thing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 30 01 Peterson:</b> Yeah, we concur. G&N looks great.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> The noise that we are getting on the downlink [from the] spacecraft is due to the handover from the 210 foot dish antenna at Goldstone to the 85 foot dish also at Goldstone. We've now gotten good lock-on and should have good solid communication.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 32 25 Duke:</b> Houston, 16 on Omni Alfa. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 32 28 Peterson:</b> Roger, 16. You're loud and clear.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 32 33 Duke:</b> Okay. We dropped up-link, it looked like, for a while. Signal strength went to zero on all antennas, and I had a Command Reset, and we're Omni Alfa, if that's okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 32 53 Peterson:</b> If you'll go Pitch minus 70 and Yaw 130, we can reacquire on the high gain, 16.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 33 03 Young:</b> In where?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 33 04 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 33 45 Duke:</b> Okay. There you are, Pete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 33 47 Peterson:</b> Okay. You're loud and clear.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. We're standing by now for the antennas at Goldstone, California which were locked-up on the Command Module.</p> <a name="203_34_27"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 34 27 Peterson:</b> Okay. Charlie, a little while back, you were asking what time Tony was going to come aboard, and he's just walked in here and gotten plugged up if you've got anything for him.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 34 40 Duke:</b> Okay. Say again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 34 42 Peterson:</b> Earlier you were asking what time Tony was going to come in, and he's on board right now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 34 50 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> As soon as the Goldstone antenna is properly pointed at the lunar surface we'll be switching over to the Lunar Communications Relay Unit camera.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 35 07 Young:</b> Hey, Tony, this is John. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 35 11 England:</b> Yeah. Go ahead, John.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 35 15 Young:</b> I don't know if we told you or not, but Charlie and I think you really did one whale of a job doing those EVAs. We know how tough that is to do all those real-time changes. We just thought you did one heck of a good job, and we sure appreciate it. Just wanted you to know that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 35 34 England:</b> Oh, thank you much. But you guys made it awful easy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 35 42 Duke:</b> Hey, Tony. I was sitting here today thinking about those rocks we got, and the thing that really strikes me is that there was - I really don't think we got any volcanic rocks to speak of. Maybe some of those little black clasts were volcanics, but otherwise - I don't think we got any. There wasn't any there. The - there was one other - one other point that could have been - Those ones we were calling shocks could have been a tuff breccia, since they were so friable. But - that we might - that might prove to be the case; but to us, they looked shocked due to the other features that we saw that - that - applied a shocked metamorphism. Over.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 36 37 England:</b> Right. We - From your description, we had thought there was a good chance that you might have gotten a tuff breccia there. I think, also, the fact that a lot of the breccias were one-rock breccias would in - would mean that you may have your basalts or gabbroic anorthosites or whatever, and that they're just broken up. If they're one-rock breccias or two-rock breccias, it still has most of the information of the - of the rocks we're looking for. It's not like a - you know - if you remember, it's not like a soil breccia, where everything is lost. So we - we're very happy with what you found. Also, did anyone brief you on the newest on the X-ray results ?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 37 17 Duke:</b> No. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 37 18 England:</b> Okay. You remember the first look I gave - The first look that I reported to you indicated that the aluminium-to-silicon ratio was sort of intermediate. Well, they've gone back; and with the newer data and a better analysis, it turns out that Descartes has one of the highest ratios on the Moon. The only place we've seen like it right now is on the east side of Smythii. We don't really have a good comparison yet with the east of Crisium. But anyway, it indicates that if any place has anorthosites, you've found them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 37 56 Duke:</b> I tell you, Tony, some of those rocks that we picked up - I was leaning, with the color and the crystalline structure that we had - they really gave me the - I didn't want to call it that, but they were certainly crystalline rocks; and there was no question in my mind. They had a sugary texture - the whitish ones. That big - one on the - rim of North Ray, there, with the shatter cone that had - a - a bluish tint to it in the crystalline structure. Although, it might have been just the - an aph - I say crystalline structure, or it might have been an aphanitic matrix; but y'all are gonna sort all of that out when you get bagged ones. I tell you, it really wasn't what we thought - I thought we were going to find up there. I imagined a lot of volcanics; and frankly, if the - if these shocked rocks turn out to be tuff breccias, that will be the only volcanics we found.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 02 England:</b> Right. Understand. I think ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 04 Young:</b> [Garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 05 England:</b> ... the fact that you recovered from the picture we had given you before you went and went ahead and found out what was there and sampled it so well - I think that's - a good indication that the training was good and you guys are really on the ball.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 26 Duke:</b> Well, we tried hard, anyway, Tony; and I think we got every - a piece of every rock that was up there. I really do. They were - and that's, I think, because we were lucky, and the rocks were identifiable.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 46 England:</b> You know, the ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 47 Duke:</b> [garble]</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 48 England:</b> ... difference between a rock being identifiable mad not being identifiable is the level of training. That just says you guys were well trained.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 39 58 Duke:</b> Well, you guys tried to beat it into us long enough, I'll tell you that. Hope we did a good job.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 40 08 England:</b> I just got a set of questions that the geology team ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 40 11 Duke:</b> It looks like ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 40 12 England:</b> ... would like to send up to you sometime. Maybe sometime during the Trans-Earth coast, we'll have a chance. I haven't really read through them, so I don't know what they're all about yet.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 40 26 Duke:</b> Okay. Well, we're gonna go into an eat period and a an EVA prep and try to get some rest before the EVA tomorrow, so - we'll wait on those. Okay?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 40 34 England:</b> That's fine. Hey, we have the TV back on on the Moon up there, and everything's looking fine. It hasn't changed much since you left.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 40 47 Duke:</b> Well, we were glad that y'all were able to watch lift-off. We heard that they got about 30 or 40 seconds, which, I think, was neat. It took me about that long to uncase my eyeballs when that ascent engine lifted off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 41 01 England:</b> (Laughter) Yeah. Great.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 41 03 Duke:</b> It certainly wasn't what I thought I was going to - experience.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 41 09 England:</b> Yeah. INCO was really on the ball. They tracked you right up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 41 15 Duke:</b> Well, that's just super.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 41 21 England:</b> I don't know - We don't know whether Ken understood the up-link while ago on the biomed harness. The idea is that he's going to have to change it before the EVA in the morning. So, if he'll sleep better without one on tonight, he could take the old one off, now.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 41 40 Young:</b> Okay. We'll tell him.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 42 23 Duke:</b> And, Tony, the only - on that - on the rocks, back to one other little point, there. That - You know, we called the whitish rocks tuff breccias- I mean, shocked rocks. But we're cou - at least, I'm personally convinced that there are at least two endogenic craters that we passed, and - the big one on the way to North Ray and the big one coming back from - from Stop 8. And so, that might have been a source of a tuff - if that's what they turn out to be.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 43 03 England:</b> Very good. I just want to emphasize again that ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 43 10 Young:</b> [Garble] situation, though.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 43 12 England:</b> Right. I understand. I just think it was outstanding, maybe serendipity, that we probably - your landing there at Descartes probably sampled the most differentiated place we could find on the front side of the Moon. I think that's really outstanding.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 43 34 Duke:</b> That's the feeling I got when we started seeing those rocks. That - that basalt that I called under the engine bell there, I think, might end up to be that blackish-bluish rock that we sampled up at North Ray, and so - we'll - but we'll see. We couldn't get any of what I call real basalt in rocks. Maybe some of the clasts will be, though.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 03 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 05 Young:</b> Could you tell from the TV, Tony, how rough that place was? Could you see all those - those swales and valleys that we didn't have mapped on our - that didn't show up on our map that were maybe, some of them, 30, 40, 50 meters deep?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 24 England:</b> Yeah, I sure could. It reminded me of a dune area.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 30 Young:</b> Yeah. That's what it sort of looked like, sort of a dunes plains.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 36 England:</b> Incidentally, somebody here is kind of worried about ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 39 Young:</b> I'll tell you -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 40 England:</b> ... thermal problems, and we would like to get into PTC as soon as possible..</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 45 Young:</b> Okay, as soon as the thing - as soon as the rates get low enough, we will.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 49 England:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 51 Young:</b> Are the rates good enough now?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 44 54 England:</b> Negative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 45 06 Duke:</b> Tony, that one - that crater at - the endogenic one that we described coming back from North Ray and going out, it - I was guessing 80 meters, John said about 50, but it was really deep; and I'm surprised that we didn't - I sure had no feel for that before we started.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 45 32 England:</b> Right. Understand.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 45 44 Duke:</b> I'll tell you one thing, your hair sure doesn't feel very good aft - up here after 3 days with it full of orange juice.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 45 52 England:</b> I don't know. It may do great things.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 45 57 Duke:</b> That stuff is great glue, I'll tell you. Boy, we were really worried about those hel - getting those helmets off, but they came - came right on off after we eventually broke the thing and got them cleaned up then.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 46 11 England:</b> Okay, and on your Flight Plan there, at right about 227:00, for setting up for PTC, I guess your DAP has to be set up for B/D Roll.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 46 24 Duke:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 48 45 Young:</b> Houston, can you give us a holler when these rates get good enough to start PTC?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 48 50 England:</b> Sure will.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 50 18 England:</b> Apollo 16, last time you changed the LiOH canister, did you happen to wiggle the other one and see if it had swelled up in there?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 50 28 Young:</b> No, we sure didn't. That one out of B just came right out.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 50 32 England:</b> Okay.</p>

      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> This is Apollo Control. We're in the process of a shift handover in Mission Control at the present time. Flight Director Gerry Griffin and his team coming on now to replace the Pete Frank team and the spacecraft communicator on this shift, in fact already on duty is astronaut Tony England. We do have an updated time now for the EVA from the Command Module. That is scheduled to occur at the Flight Plan time of 242 hours, 55 minutes, that's our updated Ground Elapsed Time and that would be at 2 hours - rather 2:03 pm Central Standard Time tomorrow. That is the time - the predicted time for the hatch opening for the EVA, again that time is 2:03 pm central standard time. That's a change from the previous time that we had listed of 4:47 pm Central Standard Time. The Flight Plan time again, 242 hours, 55 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. In computing Central Standard Time, from our new updated GET, perhaps the easiest method is to - in the Flight Plan change the time notation at the top of each page which is the hour plus 54 minutes for example, the present GET time is 228 hours 43 minutes at the top of that page in the Flight Plan, which starts with 228, hours 00 minutes above that notation is the Central Standard Time notation of 23:54 or 11:54 [pm]. That time on the top of that particular page would then change to 11:08 [pm] or 23:08 Central Standard Time and that time would follow through the rest of the way through the Flight Plan. At the top of every page, that time updates one hour. The next page would go from 23:54 to 01:54, the way it is currently printed in the Flight Plan. To update that to the present Central Standard Time, it would simply be necessary to change it to 08, change the last two digits from 54 to 08. If a Flight Plan is not available, the total amount of time added to the clock since liftoff is 24 hours, 46 minutes. It would therefore be possible to get a corrected GET or in effect an actual Ground Elapsed Time rather than an updated Ground Elapsed Time by subtracting 24 hours, 46 minutes from the GET time that we're currently showing in Mission Control. In other words, we're not showing 228 hours, 44 minutes and 22 seconds. To get the actual Ground Elapsed Time, from that updated GET time, it would be necessary to subtract 24 hours, 46 minutes from that time. We do have a clock in the Control Center which is counting actual GET time and does reflect that difference of 24 hours and 46 minutes. On the TV monitors, that would be the clock with the nomenclature TB 5 and currently, that clock is showing 203 hours, 58 minutes, 53 seconds.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 58 58 England:</b> Okay, Apollo 16. You've got a Go for spinup.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>203 59 04 Duke:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p> <a name="204_00"></a>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer: </b> Tony England giving Apollo 16 a Go for spinup. That's the signal that they may begin the Passive Thermal Control mode, puting the spacecraft in a slow rotation of three revolutions per hour. Prior to the - following the PTC, after getting [the] spacecraft spun up, the crew will have completed all of the activities required before beginning their sleep period. At 228 hours 46 minutes [204:00] updated Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control Houston.</p>
      <p class="ed">[No more communications on Day 10.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 229 hours, 35 minutes [204:48] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 presently is 12,791 nautical miles out from the Moon approaching Earth at 4,700 feet per second. During the change of shift press conference just completed there have been no communications with Apollo 16. We'll continue to stay up live with the air/ground circuit until the final sign off. But it appears there will likely be a great deal of dead air.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control at 230 hours, 7 minutes [205:20] Ground Elapsed Time. Apparently [the] Apollo 16 crew has indeed gone to sleep, without saying good night. Distance, 14,250 nautical miles out from the Moon, velocity 4,658 feet per second relative to the Moon. Spacecraft now weights 27,427 pounds. And at 230 hours, 8 minutes [205:21] Ground Elapsed Time; this is Apollo Control, out.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 231 hours, 47 minutes [207:00] Ground Elapsed Time. Apollo 16 crew asleep at this time. No communications from them in over 2 hours - 2 and a half hours. Distance 18,747 nautical miles outbound from the Moon. Velocity 4,568 feet per second. For the statistical minded, here is some numbers on leaving the Moon's sphere of influence. The halfway mark in distance, the halfway mark in time. We exit the lunar sphere of influence in about 6 hours at a Ground Elapsed Time of 237 hours 27 minutes 51 seconds [212:41:49] and at which time the distance from the Moon will be 33,821 nautical miles. Height above the Earth at that time 187,827 nautical miles. The halfway point and distance will take place at Ground Elapsed [Time of] 266:39:00 [241:52:58]. The distance to both bodies, Earth and Moon at that time will be 112,726 [miles]. The halfway time in the Moon-Earth transit will take place at Ground Elapsed Time of 257:45:12 [232:59:10]. At the halfway point in time the distances are 87,593 [miles] from the Moon and 138,683 [miles] from the Earth. At 231:49 [207:02], this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 232 hours, 47 minutes [208:00] Ground Elapsed Time. Some 3 hours, 12 minutes remaining in the Apollo 16 crew rest period. Crew apparently sound asleep at this time. Meanwhile the spacecraft is 21,445 nautical miles out from the Moon approaching Earth at 4,532 feet per second. And during this graveyard shift that's about all there is to say. At 232:47 [208:00], this is Apollo Control.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 234 hours, 47 minutes [210:00] Ground Elapsed Time, One hour and 12 minutes remaining in the Apollo 16 crew rest period. However, they will likely sleep in another hour beyond this time. Apollo 16 presently is 26,754 nautical miles out from the Moon, approaching Earth at 4,484 feet per second. The Spaceflight Meteorology Group of the National Weather Service said this morning that weather conditions for the landing and recovery operations of Apollo 16 [on] Thursday are expected to be satisfactory. The planned landing area, near the equator some 1200 nautical miles south of Hawaii, has a weather forecast calling for scattered clouds, easterly trade winds at 10 knots, 3-foot seas, and a temperature near 82 degrees. At 234:48 [210:01], this is Apollo Control.</p> <a name="211_00" ]></a>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control [at] 235 hours, 47 minutes [211:00] Ground Tlapsed Time. Although the wake clock shows 12 minutes remaining in the sleep period the crew actually will probably sleep an additional hour and half. No more than that unless they wake up and call the Control Center earlier than hour and half from now. Distance 29,421 nautical miles out from the Moon. Velocity 4,469 feet per second. Some of the major events coming up during the day would be the Mid-Course [Correction] 5 if it's actually performed. That still hasn't been pinned down yet why they're not [sic]. The velocity change is great enough to warrant doing it this time. The Trans-Earth EVA to retrieve the film cassettes from the Scientific Instrument Module, additional runs with some of the instrumentation in the SIM bay, Gamma Ray and X-Ray equipment. And that pretty well fills up the work dav with the next rest period scheduled to begin at about 252 hours 30 minutes [227:43]. At 235:49 [211:02], this is Apollo Control.</p>
