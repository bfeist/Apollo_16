      <p class="ed">[Lunar Rev 23 Begins at 117:33.]</p>
      <p class="ed">[As Day 6 starts, Ken Mattingly is being woken up about two hours later than his colleagues in the Lunar Module. John Young and Charlie Duke will conduct the first EVA on the first full day of their stay on the Moon. For the next few hours, the primary focus of press and public interest is on the surface activity; there is no significant Public Affairs Officer commentary until 126 hours, 21 minutes GET, which is after the end of this Chapter.]</p> <a name="117_53_30"></a>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 53 30 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning, Casper. Up and at them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 15 Mattingly:</b> Hello, Houston. Are you there this morning?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 19 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning, Casper. How are you feeling this morning?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 25 Mattingly:</b> Swinging.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 29 Hartsfield:</b> You get a good night's rest?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 34 Mattingly:</b> Sure did. That's the best sleep I've had since I've been in here.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 38 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that sounds great. Whenever you're ready to get a few things done before your eating period, let me know.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay. If you get some things for me to copy, I'll get started on that. Then we can catch up on the crew status when we get a chance.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 55 59 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Before we get started, Ken, could you terminate the Bat A charge?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 56 10 Mattingly:</b> No sooner said than done.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 56 33 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken, how about let's starting with the Flight Plan changes for a couple of revs here and get that out of the way?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 56 52 Mattingly:</b> Say, just a second. Let me check the test meter.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 57 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay, the battery compartment is sitting right at 1.5 volts. So, I guess the next time we go to do a dump and stuff, it wouldn't hurt to vent that, too.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 57 19 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 57 35 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let's go.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 57 37 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The - the first item is right here at the wakeup, 118 hours. We have already terminated the bat charge. We want to - we don't need to write all this in. I'll just tell you what we want to get from you is a film status report, which we didn't pick up last night. And, a little bit later here, we want to up-link the lift-off time. The first item really comes at 118:15 and there we want to put, "Sync mission timer to CMC clock." And that is a Verb 5 Noun 1 Enter, 1706 Enter. And then T<sub>ephem</sub> verification by MSFN. Copy on MSFN cue. I guess you're familiar with that procedure, aren't you?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 58 30 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 58 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, and they got a note here where we copy out three registers at the time - at the proper time. Okay, the next item is 118:55 - delete the charge Battery B.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 58 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Battery charge B charge is deleted.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 59 06 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, at - stand by a minute, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 59 21 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken, that should get you through the next couple of revs. We are just gonna follow the Flight Plan. The - how about now let's set up our cryo configuration. We would like to verify the - that we're using the 100-volt heaters on O<sub>2</sub> . That's on Panel 226, I believe.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 59 54 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's verified.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>117 59 59 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, and back on panel 2, we want O<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Auto, and 3, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 00 11 Mattingly:</b> That's verified.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 00 12 Hartsfield:</b> H<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 00 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay, H<sub>2</sub> Heaters 1 and 2, Off.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 00 26 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And H<sub>2</sub> fans, 1 and 2, Off, and 3, Auto.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 00 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Fans in Tank 3 are Auto.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 00 53 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken, we got a message that says, "Do not vent the battery compartment."</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 01 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I won't do that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 01 06 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, the next item - We are wondering if you got the screens on the suit hoses. Those screens are normally stored in the PGA bags during launch and we don't know whether you ever got those on or not. If you didn't, you can put those on and get increased circulation in the cockpit, there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>118 01 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay. No, we sure didn't. I plugged up the inlet side so that it wouldn't get dirt in them and then he put the screens on. I'll - I'll do that.</p> <a name="118_01_41" </a>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 01 41 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, just make a note to yourself there to get that done. Okay, I'll tell you a little bit about SIM Bay status here. Mapping camera is working fine; no anomalies. The only problem we had was that retract. And our plan on that is that we are going to leave the mapping camera out except when we are doing coupled RCS. The laser altimeter has fired 663 times since launch. But it is starting to miss now about 20 percent of the time on the altitudes. Pan camera's working fine; no anomalies. We've got a margin of 58 frames. I forgot to give you margins on the mapping camera. We're 452 frames ahead there. Mass spec is performing good. And the extend/retract performance is good except that the boom is hanging up near full or retraction. You are aware of that. However, the boom has been verified safe for SPS burns. The gamma ray is getting good data. The gain is stable and has excellent resolution. Boom performance is nominal. X-ray and alpha particles are both good.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 03 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Have they seen anything unusual on any of their data yet?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 03 13 Hartsfield:</b> That's negative, Ken. And, if you will give us Accept, we'll get on with your state vector updates. Stand by - That's clock update.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 03 23 Mattingly:</b> You got them.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 03 40 Hartsfield:</b> And, for your information on planning, we're not going to reschedule any extra mapping camera or pan camera passes today to make up for what we missed yesterday. We're just going to go with the Flight Plan.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 03 55 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 03 58 Hartsfield:</b> And - in regard to the booms, we are gonna do - follow the nominal extension and retractions for the mass spec, except we are going to try to get the retractions done during AOS, so we can watch it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 04 19 Mattingly: </b>Okay, that sounds good, and - was the mapping camera retract time really as long as I thought it was?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 04 33 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 04 41 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative, Ken. They got 03:15 on their data down here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 04 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 04 53 Hartsfield:</b> And, in regard to your EKG, sometime when you get a chance here, we want you to service the - the leads there. Want you to doff your harness, replace the sponges and tape, and don it again.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 05 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's about - that's about a 20-minute job.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 05 14 Hartsfield:</b> Just whenever you can work it in. No real rush there...</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 05 17 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] piecemeal, if I get a chance.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 05 50 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, consumables status looks just about like it was when you went to bed last night. Nothing really to report there. And I guess, we can go ahead and start on your post-sleep checklist and we'll be standing by for your crew status report and SIM status report.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 06 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll have that for you in just a minute.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 09 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. I am ready for our little crew status update. Then, - let's see. You want me to take the Mass Spec, Ion Source, to Standby now?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 09 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Ken. Go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 09 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay, it's in Standby. I'll get - Pan Camera Mode is in Standby and the Power is coming On -</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 09 47 Mattingly:</b> Mark.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 09 48 Mattingly:</b> Barber pole, back to gray. Okay, ready for a little crew status.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 09 58 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 10 07 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Bravo 1, 15048; Bravo 3, 6-1/2 - the best yet; Bravo 4, none. On the menu side, the happy gourmet says that meal A for Mattingly: was a large orange juice with potassium. Meal B was - and then breakfast, a chocolate bar, sugar cookies, and another citrus beverage with potassium. Meal C - chicken and rice, two orange drinks, fruit cocktail, pineapple fruitcake. I got - I guess yesterday morning - for the Commander, you can delete the peaches, you can delete the grits on the LMP. You can delete the peaches, you can delete the eggs, and you can add an extra orange pineapple with potassium.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 11 49 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We got all that.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 14 14 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. You're cleared for Pan Camera Power, Off. The lens is tucked.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 14 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll get that in just a second.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 15 36 Mattingly:</b> Pan Camera Power is Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 15 38 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 15 53 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken. We are up - up-linking the state vector to you now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 16 00 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 18 45 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. The computer is yours.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 18 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay, thank you, sir.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 21 00 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. Whenever you get a chance, we can take the Gamma Ray Shield, Off and the Mass Spec Ion Source, On.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 21 09 Mattingly:</b> Mass Spec Ion Source is On; the Gamma Ray Shield is Off; Shield is Off.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 21 18 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 22 31 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, no need to acknowledge, but give us a call when you get ready to sync your mission timer.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 22 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'm trying to catch this photograph of Davy, and I'm almost over it now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 23 23 Mattingly:</b> It looks to me like I'm not going to be able to get it because the terminator isn't quite far enough over this time. I guess we're far enough off on our basic here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 23 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, you say Davy hadn't moved out into the light, yet?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 23 40 Mattingly:</b> No, the terminator is lying just to the west of Ptolemaeus. I can see the highlands and I think I see probably the first crater chain - first of the craters in the chain. And, in fact, that may be Davy G. But the rest of it is still in the shadow.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 24 02 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 24 03 Mattingly:</b> I guess I will have to let that one go today. Okays well, let's get back to where you were.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 24 43 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, what's happening here, Hank. It looks like we are a little bit early, but it still looks like those times would have been - these times probably weren't gonna quite hack it anyhow.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 24 55 Hartsfield:</b> I am a little bit puzzled by this, too, Ken. That should have been good.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 24 57 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and I am ready. Okay, let's see. We need to catch up on T<sub>ephem</sub>, right?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 25 08 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 25 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that's what I show on 1706.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 25 33 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We got the numbers. It looks good.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 25 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay, and I copied them down. Well, we can sync the mission timers to that, huh?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 26 00 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 29 05 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, in regard to that Davy thing - I was just talking to Spence and he says that the - that was the correct time and that - that - where they call officially the terminator. And the photo setting should have worked. But it sounds like from what you said, it may have been a little too dark.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 29 27 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) There's nothing but hard shadows down there where Davy is. Maybe - maybe the rim of Ptolemaeus there's - and Alphonsus, and that area is a little higher than we calculated because it wouldn't have to be off by much in order to keep you from - from missing it. I - after we talked about it there - why, looked out the side to the south, and it looked like further south in the mare. The terminator did go out a little further. So, I think we got caught by elevation.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 29 59 Hartsfield:</b> I suspect that's the case, Ken.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 30 08 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll whip into a little P52 here.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 31 03 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Hank.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 31 31 Mattingly:</b> Well, there's the old Earth, again. And it's getting smaller. I think it's not sanforized.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 31 36 Hartsfield:</b> Roger (laughter).</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 31 46 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, in your post-sleep, did you terminate the jet monitor?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 31 52 Mattingly:</b> Oh, hey - no. Let me write that out on my post-sleep checklist right now. They wrote that in as an extra item yesterday, and I forgot it this morning.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 32 20 Mattingly:</b> It sure pays to have you guys watching.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 32 22 Hartsfield:</b> Well, I just happened to think of that one, and I got to thinking about your P52, using SCS, and then I wondered about the jet monitor program.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 32 39 Mattingly:</b> For that one, you get the award for the year. That was smooth.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 33 14 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken. Whenever you get a chance, Gamma Ray, Shield, On. When you get through with this.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 33 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Gamma Ray Shield is coming On -</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 33 33 Mattingly:</b> Mark it.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 38 14 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. We got the 93. You are clear...</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 38 ]6 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you folks have the angles.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 38 ]7 Hartsfield:</b> ...to torque.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 38 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll do it at 10.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 38 58 Hartsfield:</b> And, Casper; Houston. Got a little update to you there for that dead band test. We'd like to change the 5 degrees to 2-1/2 degrees.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 39 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Make that 2-1/2.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 39 53 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken. Since we updated the clock, we need to update the time on the T<sub>ig</sub> for the TEI-26. The rest of the TEI-26 PAD's good. So, whenever you are ready to copy, I'll read you the new T<sub>ig</sub>.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 40 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Just a second. Let me get my GDC here. This GDC is working a lot better. When we started out, I made a drift check on it, you know - right after insertion, and it was drifting pretty readily. And now, this thing will go for six hours and be off less than ten degrees. I guess it just - maybe once it got warmed up, it just sort of stabilized, and it's really - really doing a good job now.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 40 43 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that sounds real great.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 40 48 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, it is particularly nice to know (laughter).</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 41 25 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Why don't you give me a new time for TEI-26?</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 41 29 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. T<sub>ig</sub> is 125:26:15.47.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 41 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay, that is 25:26:15.47.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 41 56 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. That's 125.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 42 10 Mattingly:</b> Yeah - yeah, 125. Thank you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 42 40 Mattingly:</b> And I got the Purge Line Heaters On.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 42 45 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 42 46 Mattingly:</b> And, about now, suppose I give you - try to give you a rundown on the film.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 42 52 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Go ahead, Ken.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 42 54 Mattingly:</b> Didn't use any of the - we didn't use any of the UV film yesterday - that's magazine Oscar Oscar. Magazine Sierra Sierra reads 20 frames. I'm just going to have to go through the film locker here and pull out mags and tell you what's on them.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 43 26 Mattingly:</b> Okay, November November is completed.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 44 33 Mattingly:</b> And, Victor - we're only up to 8.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 44 03 Mattingly:</b> On the 35 millimeter, I used the - well, we didn't finish up that CIN roll that the ALFMED was on; it's the same status it had then, but I had to take it out in order to get X-ray X-ray put in - the earthshine, which we didn't get last night, and if we're gonna get it, we ought to get it right soon because that Earth is getting considerably smaller. The - I had to take that CIN mag out, unfortunately. And I'll go through the 16s here. I used portions - two of them, one for the undocking sequences and one for the landmark tracking.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 46 24 Mattingly:</b> And magazine Charlie Charlie, I'm showing 60 percent; that's 60.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 46 59 Mattingly:</b> And on magazine - Bravo Bravo, I have 80 percent.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 47 16 Mattingly:</b> I think that should be all of the film, Hank.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 47 18 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We got it, Ken.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 47 33 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, I've got one more Flight Plan update for you.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 47 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 47 48 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by one minute.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 48 57 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, I'll read this change up to you next time. About what it amounts to is we're going to delete the bistatic radar and in its place, we're going to put an oblique photo pass. And I - I'll catch you on the next rev with it. We got about 4&frac12; minutes to LOS.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 49 16 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 50 34 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. We lost comm there a little - a little while. We're about three minutes from LOS, and everything's looking good. Have a good breakfast, and we'll see you on the next rev.</p>
        <p class="obcm"><b>118 50 47 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> All right, Henry. Talk to you in about 40 minutes, then.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 51 41 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 51 46 Mattingly:</b> Go ahead.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 51 47 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We show your Manual Attitude in Accel Command.</p>
        <p class="tech"><b>118 52 10 Mattingly:</b> Well, thank you. I wonder how - how that one happened. I tell you it's pretty easy to kick a switch when you're rolling around in here. You chase a piece of the Flight Plan away from you or you kick a camera, and that's not an unusual thing to happen. I appreciate you telling me about it.</p> <a name="118_52_32" </a>

              <p class="tech"><b>119 41 46 Mattingly:</b> Sure do feel a lot better. (Laughter) I got quite a bit done on that little back-side section there.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 41 57 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that sounds great. First thing off the bat here, Ken, we'd like to get a Bat B charge going.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 42 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Stand by.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 42 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you've got it.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 42 54 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. And for your info, Ken, the E-Mod we got last night looks good.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 43 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 43 17 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, I got a few items for you whenever you're ready to work them in. I've got a mapping camera photo PAD, a Flight Plan update, and an update to your erasable loads, and a G&amp;C checklist, whenever you can get a break from eating there.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 43 34 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Okay, I'm just getting a good start on that. And I'll copy those as we go along here. If you'll give me a couple of minutes to get some things going.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 46 21 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. I'm ready to copy.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 46 26 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We'll start with the Flight Plan changes. And the first one's at 123:26.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 46 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 46 43 Hartsfield:</b> Incidentally, Ken. Did you get the urine dump and purges out on the last back side?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 46 50 Mattingly:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 46 52 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. At 123:26, we're going to delete the maneuver to Bistatic Radar attitude; we're going to delete the Bistatic, as we told you earlier. At the top of the next column there, about 123:32, delete all of that where you configure the S-band. Following that, delete the - or the VHF. Following that, delete the S-band; delete the P20 following that. In fact, delete everything in that column. And delete the Bistatic Radar over to the right-hand side at the bottom.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 47 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 47 32 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Now back at 123:26, we want to add in there this 40-degree south oblique - a P20 option 5; 40-degree south oblique photo attitude. Parenthe - see - see - parentheses 123:31. Your Noun 78 is plus 270.00, plus 087.75, plus 180.00. Noun 79, plus 000.50; attitude 182,000 underlined slash 080, 000. Set High Gain Pitch 10, Yaw 350 for AOS acquisition.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 48 59 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. I copy 40-degrees south oblique, replacing the Bistatic Radar; P20 option 5 at 123:31; Noun 78, plus 270, plus 87.75, plus 180. Noun 79 is 0.50, giving me an attitude of 182, 080, and 000. And the Pitch 10 and Yaw 350 for acquisition.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 49 24 Hartsfield:</b> That's a good readback. And on the next page, you can delete the Bistatic Radars in both columns. And at 124 - wait, take it back - let's go back to the previous page - lost something there; 123:31. We want to add, at 123:31...</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 49 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 49 49 Hartsfield:</b> Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On, T-start; and Image Motion, barber pole plus 3, and then On.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Do you have a T-start time?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 13 Hartsfield:</b> We'll get that up to you in a PAD; that's still a long ways away.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 19 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 22 Hartsfield:</b> Then over at 124:32, we want Mapping Camera, Off at T-stop.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 33 Mattingly:</b> Wait a min - one - wait a minute. Say - say the time again.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 36 Hartsfield:</b> 124:32, on the next page.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 44 Hartsfield:</b> Mapping...</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 45 Mattingly:</b> Got it.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 50 46 Hartsfield:</b> Mapping Camera, Off, T-stop; wait 30 seconds; Mapping Camera to Standby; and Image Motion, Off.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 03 Hartsfield:</b> And could you give us Auto on the High Gain?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 08 Mattingly:</b> You've got it.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 10 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, and the last change is at 125:06, the following page. Delete the P52, about 125:06 there.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 23 Mattingly:</b> Got it. That sure is a super little platform, isn't it?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 28 Hartsfield:</b> Boy, it's a beauty.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 42 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I have a - a mapping camera photo PAD.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 51 58 Hartsfield:</b> This PAD goes at 121:35, approximately.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 52 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 52 13 Hartsfield:</b> All righty. T-start is 121:32:18; T-stop, 122:32:08.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 52 30 Mattingly:</b> Okay; 121:32:18, 122:32:08.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 52 38 Hartsfield:</b> And the last item I have for you is a change to your erasable loads and the G&amp;C...</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 52 43 Mattingly:</b> Okay, just - just a second, Hank, let me write those down.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 53 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I got a PAD for the erasables. All right, let me find that. I just wanted to write the T-stop times down before I got away from them.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 53 23 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. This is in your G&amp;C Checklist on page 9-4.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 53 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm going after it. I've got it.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 53 40 Hartsfield:</b> All righty. In column A, OID 05 change 03773 to read 03521.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 53 52 Mattingly:</b> Whoop, whoops. I missed that, Hank.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 54 00 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 54 01 Mattingly:</b> I guess I'm going to have to do one thing or the other. I can't talk and eat at the same time.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 54 04 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Whenever you're ready, we'll - you - If you don't want to do it now, just holler.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 54 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let me finish this eat period.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 54 14 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 54 17 Mattingly:</b> I got - I got carried away with trying to get ahead.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 55 06 Mattingly:</b> Hey, Hank. If you got time while I'm - while I can listen, and - how about telling me if there's - you got any words on the general EVA plan for the surface and - guys are doing.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 55 23 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. The guys are outside now on the surface. They got the Rover deployed and they're checking it out. And they're going to try to do the nominal number 1 EVA plan. As - about as far as we can predict in the future right now is through - doing the second EVA tomorrow. We don't know how consumables are going to hold out for the - for the thing. We're going to have to take a look at it - whether there's a possibility of the third one or not. Right now, I'm not so sure.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 55 56 Mattingly:</b> There - there still is some chance, huh?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 55 59 Hartsfield:</b> Well, it doesn't look too bright, but they're looking at it.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 56 15 Mattingly:</b> Have they got the ALSEP out yet? Or does that come after the Rover?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>119 56 19 Hartsfield:</b> That comes after the Rover.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 02 37 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, Houston. Just a little reminder - about time for - to open the alpha particle X-ray cover.</p>

              <p class="tech"><b>120 08 14 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. A... </p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 08 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 08 19 Hartsfield:</b> The old data should read 03773. The new data there should be 03521.</p>

              <p class="tech"><b>120 09 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay. New data, 65620. That's column Bravo, 05. </p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 09 48 Hartsfield:</b> That's correct, Ken, and that's all of that. I hate to go back, but along about 125:06, when we deleted that P52, we should have deleted the P00 that went right ahead of it.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 10 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let me come back to that in just a second. I'm passing over Madler now; and, if you remember, we talked about that funny - bright ray pattern - how it seemed to have a funny shape that it - it took off in one direction and then it made a straight line in the other. Well, there's a textural difference in the ground that's underneath that bright material. It's a - It looks like it's - more like highlands - kind of overlay that's on top of a regular mare material. And it does, in fact, go along those - that line of demarcation that we see, and it seems to overlay the - the mare-type, and it's - it doesn't go very far to the south and it doesn't go very far to the west. It's right along that line where you see it. And then there's a little wrinkle - a little cluster of craters and ridges that goes along with the - line of - that goes between Madler and that bright-rayed crater with an excluded zone to the south of them - or that's to the southeast. I just remembered that question, and - I wanted to pop that in. There's also a crater directly south of Theophilus that has a - a dark halo around it, and maybe we'll get a better look at it later. He's about one crater diameter south of Theophilus, and it's about the size of the little crater in the northern end of Theophilus. And when I say dark, it's really just sort of a - of a little darker brown than the rest of the material. And it's in the middle of an area that's kind of wrinkled. Then there's another little crater just to the north and east of that that has three - a cluster of three craters around his northern rim. And he, too, has a dark halo, and his dark halo is about one and a half crater diameters, and the larger one to the south is about one and a half crater diameters. Okay. Let's go back and - you said something about - working on a P52, and then I deleted that, and I should have deleted a P00 that went with it?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 12 33 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative, Ken. We didn't catch that until after we called it up. It's the 125:06 there. We deleted a P52 and we should also delete the P00. Just keep the place [garble].</p>

              <p class="tech"><b>120 12 59 Mattingly:</b> Were you able to copy reasonably on vox?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 13 02 Hartsfield:</b> Yes, sir. I'm reading you five by five.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 13 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I wasn't sure how much it might be clipping on you. </p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 13 19 Mattingly:</b> I've got the camera ready for our pictures of Alphonsus, and it appears to me I ought to be able to catch Alphonsus and the Davy Crater chain at the same time. They ought to both be in the Sun this time.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 13 32 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that's real good, Ken.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 13 39 Mattingly:</b> Okay. We're stealing along here and I just passed Kant; and I tell you, these things aren't nearly as dramatic as they were down in that low pass. When you came over the Kant Plateau down low, it really looked like the ground was coming up. And I'm crossing the crater Descartes and that bright area; and, again, that surface of that bright area - it doesn't look nearly as distinct as it did in the low Sun. I have the landing site in the binoculars now. I can look down into South Ray, and it really is a jumbled thing. I can see one bright layer, then a dark layer, then a bright layer, and then a dark layer on the south - or on the west side. And on the south, it looks like some of the same. And I can't see into the shadows very well to the north. I'm looking over at the - Well, let's see here. I'm over - around the - I've got Double Spot in the binoculars; and let's see if I can see anything in that area.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 14 40 Hartsfield:</b> Can you see the LM?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 14 48 Mattingly:</b> Well, I was hoping I could say yes, but I don't think I do. Let us go back here and - It looks like there is one little ridge-lines around a - a - It'd be that first crater that they come up to. It's Flag or Spook. I'm upside down in my thinking that way, too. I've got the Cinco Craters and - Those terraces that we talked about that were over in - in Stone Mountain don't stand out very well from here. Looks to me like you've got a lot of the same lineations that we've seen in the other places - looks like some slumping further around than where they're going to be going up. I don't think they'll be able to recognize terraces as such.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 15 46 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 15 49 Mattingly:</b> The - the - the northwest - I mean northeast - correction - side of that extension of Stone Mountain has what I would have called slumping if it were on the inside of a crater. </p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 18 02 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken, you got about a couple of minutes to go before the terminator photos.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 18 09 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'm getting set up now, trying to get myself oriented to the best window. I tell you, I know it's not supposed to make any difference that if you're going backwards or not, but it sure does.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 18 20 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 18 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. There's Albategnius, and he's got a nice Cayley floor and a whole bunch of the - like a concentric ring, but I can't - Yeah, by golly, there's a concentric ring in that thing just like there is in the mare. And - it goes most of the way around. Some places it's overlain with the - like the crater Klein hides it.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 19 36 Mattingly:</b> Okay. The - the floor of Alphonsus is still quite shadowed.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 19 48 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken, and we're coming up on a site handover. We may lose comm for a second.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 19 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 20 21 Mattingly:</b> Hank, are you still here?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 20 22 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 20 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay, looking at Alphonsus, I'd say that there's this a - well, you can see this obvious little band that we talked about that runs north and south through there. And that's an entirely different texture than what you see on the material on either side of it. But it is the same on either side. Looking from north to south, I don't see anything that's - I can really call - I couldn't - that says there's any topographic relief going from south to north. There's no demarcation that's evident that's different at all. Although there is some of this material that's in the south that runs towards the crater center that does, indeed, look like it might - might be tapering down and thinning out. I'll come back to that in just a minute. Let me pick up Davy.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 21 51 Mattingly:</b> Well, I tell you. We aren't going to get Davy on this pass either.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 21 55 Hartsfield:</b> Still in the shadows?</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 22 01 Mattingly:</b> Sure is. You can just see the shadows run - oh, gosh, I'd say a - [vox] er of a - a quarter of a crater diameter of the size of Ptolemaeus out. And it goes to just about where - Davy G isn't obvious. I think I've got Davy G, but that's not - not obvious that I can. And- and then the rest of it just disappears. Even the central peak in Albatrajious [sic] doesn't show.</p>
              <p class="tech"><b>120 22 51 Hartsfield:</b> I wouldn't have expected that one.</p>

                      <p class="tech"><b>121 52 34 Mattingly: </b>I saw one thing that was - that was new about the zodiacal-light world. You don't realize that that stuff is actually reasonably bright until - you get yourself well dark-adopted then you sit up there long enough to recognize it. But almost - almost immediately after - oh, I'd say within - certainly within five minutes and maybe a little sooner after LOS, there was enough zodiacal light or solar corona - whichever is the proper technical name - that you could see a distinct horizon. And it just got more distinct right up until sunrise. I never did see any prominences or anything like that. I kind of thought that maybe we would, but I guess those are too small a scale. But, just prior to sunrise, you see a lot of long streaks and that's - well, I say just prior - that's like just a few seconds before sunrise. All of a sudden, you get these very prominent rays coming out and then the Sun's right there. You don't want to be looking at that.</p>

Through the binoculars, it looks like those things are dark material and light material that slumped together, and why they formed shelves like that I don't have any idea, but you can't trace them through - if they are stratigraphy, then they are indeed - not only have you had horizontal stratigraphy but you've had a great deal of vertical fractures that's caused these things to slide in different proportions.

                      <p class="tech"><b>122 02 54 Hartsfield:</b> Okay...</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 02 55 Mattingly:</b> And, I tell you it's going down. It was much more dramatic the first night than it was last night and it's not as dramatic tonight on the night-side so, if you can find a place to put it, that is one thing I'd like to get. The sooner the better.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 03 12 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. FAO advises that if you didn't take any earthshines that magazine X-ray X-ray is - which is - I think already have on the Nikon is good for the zodiacal light rather than changing to Yankee Yankee. And on this next rev...</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 03 28 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir; I'd planned to do that.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 03 31 Hartsfield:</b> On next rev, you could - if you want to take some earthshine, they suggest Window 4 and take away.</p>

                      <p class="tech"><b>122 03 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I guess I'll have to check the attitude. Do they - if I take the zodiacal light on X-Ray X-Ray, you'd - do they have a recommended magazine?</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 04 03 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 05 21 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, Ken. I've got a film story for you. If you choose to do the earthshine, use mag XX and window 4 and the target should be about - You should see it about 122:42. If you don't do the earthshine, you can go ahead and use XX for 30 - the zodiacal. If you do the earthshine, of course, with the XX, you need the YY per Flight Plan for the zodiacal.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 05 50 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I don't think it'd be prudent for me to try and get the earthshine and the zodiacal light on the same rev.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 05 58 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Copy. And the Surgeon is still anxious to see you sometime find a place to change out the sensors.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 06 09 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I understand that.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 06 24 Mattingly:</b> Hey, do you need them all changed, Hank, or can you send me to one so I don't have to waste time with all that stuff? You got to break out each one of those little things by itself and keep track of it. It - it takes a good 20 minutes if you change out the whole sensors.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 06 36 Hartsfield:</b> Stand by one.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 07 11 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, the surgeon says he can't tell which - which one of the sensors is dead, so before we take off here and do them all, why don't you try pressing down on them and let him - let him watch his data - maybe we can find out which one is the dead one. Press them one at a time.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 07 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let me - okay. I'll start on the ground. I'm pressing the ground now.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 07 45 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. That didn't do it.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 07 51 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll go to the - the sternal.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 11 Hartsfield:</b> That seemed to make it worse, Ken.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 16 Mattingly:</b> That's making it worse?</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 18 Hartsfield:</b> Yes. That's probably the culprit, but let's...</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 19 Mattingly:</b> Well, maybe that's my problem.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 20 Hartsfield:</b> ...try the third one while you're at it.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 24 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 44 Hartsfield:</b> That makes the trace a lot better, Ken. I imagine it's the third one there.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 52 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'll try changing those two out.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 08 56 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 09 40 Mattingly:</b> Boy, I'll tell you. That - that little Sun-angle change - old North and South Ray really stand out now. You couldn't miss those for anything.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 10 00 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, for your information, John and Charlie are almost through getting the ALSEP out.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 10 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Sounds good. Like an EVA should.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 10 16 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 10 22 Mattingly:</b> I know that's a bad one, but you know that's about all I can do for you today. That's probably safer than having you tell me jokes.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 10 49 Mattingly:</b> Okay. With the binocs on the area now, I'm looking down into North Ray Crater and South Ray and the interior structures of those two don't look quite the same. There's a lot more light and dark material in the South Ray; but that may be caused by the fact that it's just a- it really has been a fresher-appearing crater all around. The areas - trying to see if I can see any shadows or anything - There's a bright spot down there, but I think that's just a double spot itself. I don't see anything with the binocs that I could say I could see - I can't stabilize them quite that well. Coming down the traverse route from - where they're going across Survey Ridge - I don't think Survey is going to be easy to spot. And when you get down - there is one definite terrace - Looks like the - looks like Stone Mountain is formed with one, two, three terraces, but they are much larger than the kind of things that we were drawing on the map. The rest of that is very fine subtle lineations. The area around North Ray, particularly up along the area that they were going on the EVA - I can see it now, and it almost looks like that little pile of material that runs up to the south of their track and I'll give you some coordinates on that. I'm looking at my chart a - oh, let's see, 9 Charlie - yes, let's look at Chart 9 Charlie. And there's - this is a pretty lousy picture, but if you'll remember at a point about CY by 79, if you'll draw a line there and then draw a line down to about CU and 81, that's a - that represents a ridge, which shows up in the photographs. And looking down on it vertically, that looks like sort of a flow of material that runs up over the lip of North Ray and down into it. And it shows some craters on it, but it almost looks like a flow that runs up and down into North Ray rather than being some of the other kinds of things we've talked about. And I didn't have much time, I'll try to concentrate on that on the next rev.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 13 31 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Good show, Ken.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 13 55 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, do you want the LM coordinates in lat-long or do you want it in coordinates on 9 Charlie?</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 14 03 Mattingly:</b> Oh, I'd like to have it in 9 Charlie kind of coordinates. That's about the only thing I have to reference to.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 14 08 Hartsfield:</b> That's what I figured.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 14 09 Mattingly:</b> Let me see here if I can get - can get one last chance on our old friend that - Maybe and maybe see if he's decided to show his face this time. Don't let me forget the mapping camera, that comes about the same time.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 14 57 Hartsfield:</b> Casper, could you give us Auto on the High Gain?</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 15 04 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. You have Auto.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 15 58 Mattingly:</b> I tell you, Hank, I think that the terminator got hung up here on a high mountain or something. It doesn't look like it's moving as much as it is everywhere else on the Moon.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 16 09 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Is Davy still in the dark?</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 16 14 Mattingly:</b> Well. I'm not to it yet, but it sure - I don't see anything beyond it. That's a - Hey, old Alphonsus and Arzachel show up nicely. And here comes the crater chain, by golly. Yes, but much to my amazement, but the peak in Albategnius is still - is in daylight.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 18 04 Mattingly:</b> Oh, I see what's happened now. There's a - there's a little hill that's shielding - I - I see where Davy Crater Chain is now. And it's right in the middle of a big long shadow that's being cast out there. And it's shielding that whole area because Davy and Davy Y show up nicely. And Davy G is easy to see. But the chain itself, I can just make out, and I'll take a picture - well, this is a skewed angle. I don't know if I can get it to show you, buy - they sure must not have much of a lip on them if they don't show. But, by the time we see them, they may be in a fairly high Sun.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>121 19 00 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; copy, Ken.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 19 07 Mattingly:</b> I'm taking a strip this time, anyhow, because it'll show all the area around Davy. And there are some craters in there - an awful lot of them that have absolutely no rims, which seems to me - it looks entirely different than what you see and what you think of. These things are all very subdued. They just drop in. And you see glows - in the low Sun, you see the - you see the far lip before you see the near lip of the crater. Although there are a few that have raised rims and they - they kind of are the exception here instead of the rule. Whereas most low-Sun-angle places we see are - I'll take a shot down just a little bit to the south there, and there the average is rimmed craters and very few rimless ones.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 19 56 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Ken. And you're about 20 seconds from T-stop on the mapping camera.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 20 02 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Going to it. Thank you.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 20 28 Mattingly:</b> Okay; the Mapping Camera is Off. I'll wait 30 seconds.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 20 20 Mattingly:</b> And, Hank, this system is really good. I don't have to give a second thought to - to what's going on. And just by not having to watch that clock, it just frees your hands to go do everything else that you want to do. It really - on the back side, I get all bent out of shape with myself because I get - I get behind. I start - You just don't have a chance to do anything except those items which are timelined A, B, C and do them in exactly the sequence that they give you.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 21 11 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. The only hitch to this is I get interested in what you're saying and I might forget.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 21 20 Mattingly:</b> (Laughter) Well (laughter), just remember, they go on your card, the back side goes on mine.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 21 31 Hartsfield:</b> Actually, though, I got a bunch of guys backing me up.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 21 38 Mattingly:</b> Well, I tell you, this place is so fascinating that you just - you just don't dare let anything go by. It's - You know, I think you could stay here a lifetime, and never see it all. I guess that's - that's kind of a silly statement because it's true in almost anywhere you go. It sure is dramatic. At first glance, particularly the back side looks like an old gypsum plant. It just looks like someone's poured stuff all over it, and just made it - and just tried to hide it, camouflage things. The more you look at it, then you start to pick out subtle differences. Unfortunately, I'm not smart enough to know what these things mean, but I'm sure that we got some folks down there that certainly do. Maybe if we get enough data, why, they can piece it together.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 22 39 Hartsfield:</b> Are you in Standby now with that Mapping Camera, Ken?</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 22 45 Mattingly:</b> Yes, sir. I went to Standby and took the Image Motion, Off.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 22 48 Hartsfield:</b> Okay, thank you.</p>

                      <p class="tech"><b>122 28 29 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I was just thinking. In case we lose comm, there is one little change. After we get LOS, where you have to configure the DSE, since we've added then this mapping camera pass - oblique, we want to get High Bit Rate instead of Low Bit Rate.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 28 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Let me write that down. Figuring it says Low, and you want me to go High. Okay; and if you'd remind me of that just before LOS.</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 29 05 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; intend to - and - in regard to your comments about King, was there any other thing back - on the back side that you had of interest?</p>
                      <p class="tech"><b>122 29 21 Mattingly:</b> I - I found a couple of items back - mostly to the - I think almost all of the things that I had a chance to look at this time were to the - to the west of King. Between there and about AOS, I had a chance to look at the swirls, and to look at King - and a - and a crater - I first felt like I'd found - my first comment was that if there's ever a crater on the Moon that's got stratigraphy exposed, that's got to be it. And I hope that's wrong because there wasn't anywhere I was looking. And I took a picture of that one, and there was another little bright-rayed guy - a little splashed-out crater that looks like so many of the bright-rayed ones, except that it seems like he's built up on a mound. Got this - got this nice mound with this real bright crater in the center of it. And all the bright-rayed material is splashed around it. That too was - that was about south of Fleming, I think - somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>

And there's a place - I'll try to get a picture of this, because it shows - there's this bright thing on the horizon, which is obviously a big mountain chain and I would - It sticks up quite a number of degrees above the horizon.

That's Mandel'shtam I'm looking at, and from here, I didn't even recognize it, I'm so close, but that's it. And in the floor of Mandel'shtam, there is a definite - there's a definite flow that's along the floor there with another [garble] flows. There's a definite ridge line there in Mandel'shtam. You can see a subtle flow pattern; it runs into the crater. And then in - down in the crater shadow, with the binocs, I can see things I can't see with my eyeball. And I can see that there is a rille that runs down inside that thing; looks like the same sort of thing that shows that flow pattern on the outside that follows that scarp. And here is another band of this thing, and this thing curves around now and gets lost over here. Get a quick pic of that, and that should be 28. I'm using 5.6 and 1/125. Let's see if we can get a picture of that thing. No, I bet I've already missed it. Bigger than life, I let it get away from me.

The smaller craters - actually, their crater count here is much smaller than it is in a lot of places. This is - from a small scale, the crater count's relatively low. There are more of the large craters back here. And we see some areas now where there is just an awful lot of craters, and I'm looking in an area here that I'll get a picture of.

                            <p class="tech"><b>123 44 03 Mattingly:</b> Ah - yeah. Around Mandel'shtam, I was looking at some interesting flow features. And, again, I am using the flow feature - that's the kind of appearance it has - not that's what it is. And, right at AOS - oh, maybe 3 minutes after AOS - I mean IDS -</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>123 47 31 Mattingly:</b> Hank, right now I am looking at - coming on across Smythii and I'm looking at some features there that - up on one of the - of the subdued filled-in craters that we see on the northern edge - I - well, it's out - out of where I can reach it now, what I - what I was looking at was a crater that's - all subdued and typical of those features in Smythii. It had an outer ring and I think probably the crater I was looking at is the one that's about -</p>

                            <p class="tech"><b>123 48 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay, you've got Auto. I guess the one I was looking at is the one that's on the map about 85 degrees - no, make that about 84 degrees east and about 2 degrees south - There's a large one there. And on the northeast side of it, there is a little bright-rayed crater that I - first caught my eye. And, then there's an arcuate pattern that goes with it that's concentric to this large crater. And this bright crater is right at the head of it. This concentric material is a very light color - and if it were in a straight line, you would say it was ray material. It's possible - it doesn't look like a raised rim like the other rims on the concentric crater on the big basin. However, it looks like this little bright-rayed crater is right at the head of it. And it is - the bright-rayed crater appears to be domed up in just a slight rise and then this bright crater in top of it. And then what looks like this other ring, which is concentric to the big crater. We ought to have that on pan stuff, so I won't worry about it. Because it is almost directly into the ground track.</p>

                            <p class="tech"><b>123 52 42 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I can see La Perouse. I missed him. I got out here a little bit too late.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>123 42 58 Mattingly:</b> I should be looking at the two I was always getting confused here. And, that - must be getting pretty close to a subsolar point, because the terrain features are really hard to distinguish. I do see Kapteyn and Langrenus A. And the central feature in Langrenus A is more obvious than the one in Kapteyn from the Sun angle.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>123 53 41 Hartsfield:</b> You just passed the subsolar point, Ken, about three or four minutes ago.</p>

                            <p class="tech"><b>123 55 32 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I am looking at the central peaks in Langrenus and you can see blocks with the telescope here.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>123 55 51 Mattingly:</b> There's actually some fairly large ones on the - on the western slopes of the eastern part of the horseshoe. And there appear to be an awful lot of them in the little alluvium fan that appears to be out to the south.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>123 56 43 Mattingly:</b> And, I am trying to look at some of those dark patches that are in the southern walls. They look like flat dark blobs of material that are in - along the terraced material. And I really can't make out a great deal. Terraces in this area are - are extremely wide and fairly steep . And the walls here look relatively steep compared to the other walls around the Moon.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>123 58 11 Mattingly:</b> This is really a nice attitude for viewing things. I can see Petavius and it stacks up - great big central peak - I think that's Petavius because Petavius B is down there.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 00 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I am looking at Messier and Messier A and they're - around the elongate of the two, there doesn't appear to be anything you can pick up with binoculars except it looks kind of mottled. The interiors slope like all the rest. The interior didn't look particularly different - on - the rounded one, it looks like there is a resistant - several resistant layers in the sides, and I'll get a picture of those. In fact. they're standing out. And, it does look like there is a connection between the two craters. Some subtle thing that comes out in the direction of the tails and, then as you come out to the west, there's some darker material that runs out and looks smooth and stands out and comes out into the mare and it - almost looks like dark material might be - might be - might be a result of the crater although I'm sure that the white - the light streaks on the - are the things that are supposed to be coming out -</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 02 13 Mattingly:</b> It does appear to be, though, that when I look at the - I've got a place now where I can see the light tail and the - and the regular mare together and I got a picture of that. That's frame number 14 [AS16-120-19196] on magazine Victor. And that - It looks to me like there is a higher crater count of large craters in the light-rayed material than there is in the darker material.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 02 47 Hartsfield:</b> Say that again, Ken, about the crater count.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>122 02 52 Mattingly:</b> It looks like it's higher in the light-rayed material than it is in the darker stuff, which is, I guess, what you would anticipate.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 03 21 Mattingly:</b> If you are a fan of bright-rayed craters, frame number 15 [AS16-120-19197] is one of those, just coming up on - oh, lost my place.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 03 55 Mattingly:</b> Yeah, it's about halfway between - oh, the beginning of the highlands - Gutenberg Highlands, and - where Censorinus is.</p>

                            <p class="tech"><b>124 05 01 Mattingly:</b> And, Hank, at this higher Sun angle now when we get down here and we look at this place where the - where we're talking about the bright rays that seem to take a Funny shape between Midler and a little crater out to the east of him. It's not real obvious now that there is anything more than some bright material in between it.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 05 25 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. </p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 05 43 Mattingly:</b> I'll tell you, these Sun angles really can play tricks on you, and I'm looking at Midler now, and I got a real good view of him. And we discussed the possibility of having material come in from the north and run down inside of him. And it's not that obvious when you look down on him from here. There's material that runs over - you see a little high. As you look down inside, you see light and dark material, the same kind of combination you see in other craters. With the naked eye, it looks very much like - there's an expression that says that this ridge to the north ran down inside there and formed that little tongue. But when you look at it in blown-up detail, you see some vertical - well, now I can see places where I can see a flow pattern that's run down in. And, as a matter of fact, I'll get a picture real fast [AS16-120-19198]. Hope that gets it.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 06 42 Hartsfield:</b> Do you think that - just looking at a map here - do you think that what you're seeing could be an expression of the rim of Nectaris?</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 06 52 Mattingly:</b> No. No, I sure don't because this has a nice margin, and it curves down in and rolls down as though it had - it starts where there's a little terrace - a little - looks like part of a cratered terrace. And it runs down inside and it runs out and forms that central feature, and it runs down on the floor. And it certainly appears that it came and rolled down on there after the crater and all its slump features were already there. We'll have to come back to the question of its relation to Theophilus.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 07 26 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 09 20 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, for your information, John and Charlie are at Flag now.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 09 29 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'll wave to them. I'll tell you, NASA needs to recruit some octopuses. I could really use a couple of more hands.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 09 45 Hartsfield:</b> (Laughter) Roger.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 10 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay, I'm going to concentrate on North Ray as I distinctly believe that the - area that the traverse drawn on that goes up on the North Ray comes up on a - material that looks like it has flowed around and is part of the basic furrowed Descartes unit that's mapped back further to the east. And it looks to me like it runs down around the crater and - and straight into it.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 11 04 Mattingly:</b> I can see evidence of stratigraphy in North Ray, and lots of it in South Ray. And as we come across at - boy, I'll tell you, the - the general topography down there looks about the same all the way across the board.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 13 57 Mattingly:</b> And just at a cursory glance, we're coming up on Albategnius now and that material that's over to the east of it - that kind of hummocky and undulating material and it's furrowed. And it looks very much like the material around Descartes. I said it did in a very low Sun, and it has the appearance of having many of those same characteristics.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 14 55 Hartsfield:</b> Have you got pretty good shadows in this area now, Ken?</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 15 01 Mattingly:</b> The shadows are right here coming across Albategnius. They're pretty well cleared out. You just get the shadows from the very big peaks. At Ptolemaeus, it's almost completely clear of shadows. Alphonsus still has some. I can pick out the crater chain now. It's just now getting out of the shadow, and, sure enough, there is a great big little ridge that lays across the front of it that's been masking it all this time. The floor of Ptolemaeus looks to be like all the rest of the Cayley material. It's got a great deal of craters as you can see from the pictures. I would say the preponderance of them are rimless. As they get a little larger, they start to form with a - very - a very subtle rim, so I guess I can't say that they're all rimless. There is one, looks like a fracture, about in the middle, and it may be a scarp that's caused by a fracture, or it may be a flow pattern.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 16 51 Mattingly:</b> And as we come upon Davy chain, it appears that they do have - they don't each have an individual rim. There is mottled material in this area, and I'm going to try and get that magazine. I think you need to see this. Can you give me the settings for the - so we can take a picture of this real fast.</p>

                            <p class="tech"><b>124 17 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm going to take one here now at - that was 5.6 and t/125 I'll take a 250th. Second one's a 250th. And that ought to bracket it, I hope. And that's of the crater chain itself. And it just - it appears that they're essentially rimless, but the whole area down there is kind of mottled.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 18 16 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Did you use the EL for that?</p>

                            <p class="tech"><b>124 33 03 Mattingly:</b> Hank, can I give you some comments that are not really pertinent to anything we're doing, but little observations that I had a chance to make, and I'm afraid I'll forget them. I got too many things stored up in my head now.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 33 18 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. Go ahead.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 33 19 Mattingly:</b> But - one of - one of the things, I was just sitting here looking at the equipment and some of the things that have caused more interest than others in what we were doing. And - one of the things that is at the heart of a lot of your time in this spacecraft is fixing something to eat. Now, I'm - without discussing whether or not you need to eat this much, just the idea that if you try to eat part of it, it takes an awful long time to fix each of these things. And one of the big hang-ups is we all get clustered around the water gun. We've talked about gas coming out of the water gun, and this is not the drink port, but the food-preparation station. And the - if you - one of the ways we found we could induce gas bubbles into the waker was by depressing the plunger before it had had a chance to complete its stroke. If you let it complete its stroke, it seems to give you a nice, relatively gas-free shot of water. And it looks like the hot water gives you more for an ounce than the cold water does. But if you're very meticulous about waiting until you're sure that the plunger has made its full travel, and then count to ten or something before you push it again, the cold water isn't quite as short as it looks like it is. And I don't really know how to explain why we have gas bubbles sometimes and why we don't. It's almost as though the gas separator may not affect the problem. We started out and the first couple of days we didn't have any gas. I guess about two days. Then on the third day, we started getting gas in the hot water and we were getting like 50 percent gas. We tried the cigar gas separator, and that - that - after we got it flushed out the first time, seemed to work pretty well. And then it started getting gas, so we decided to try the prototype model. Then when we put it on the feed station - why, as soon as we put it on, why, we made a squirt and nothing came out, and we decided to try it again. And by then, it was obvious that it was building up pressure inside, and the food station was putting out water, and it wasn't coming out the other end. And we never did get water to come out the - the outlet side of the new gas separator. And it looks like it has a crack in the top on the inlet side, and the gas - the water was bubbling out of that. It was coming out under pressure. When we took the thing off, why, you could tell that the check valve or something, had never been opened. So we really don't know whether that thing has an effective use or not. And it - it seems like the more water you use, the more gas you get. I don't - I'm not sure I completely understand that. You get more gas in the hot water than you do in the cold water. But the water I've been getting out today and yesterday has been almost gas-free spin it up here, and I won't get - I get a zone of less than ten percent gas. And that's ten percent of a seven-ounce food - juice bag. The other day we were getting 50 percent. And I really can't psych out exactly all the causes for it. The cigar food - cigar dispenser there has some problems of its own. And every time you get through with it, it dribbles. And it will dribble for quite a while. But I found out if you put the little cap on it right away, then it quits dribbling. And it's only that initial dribble, and the rest of it from there on is easy. I really don't expect anything to be done with these comments. I just want to - we're supposed to evaluate these things, Hank. And rather than write them down - it's a lot easier to put here, and I'll get it off the tape after the flight.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 37 56 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. I took notes there on most of that.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 38 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm sorry. I should have told you first. I really wasn't anticipating you having to copy all that. I'm kind of rambling and being verbose. But I can see that I'm not going to get everything I see written down and probably ought to go ahead and get it jotted down some way.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 39 37 Hartsfield:</b> Ken, it looks like the next action in the Flight Plan for you is around 125:13 where it says "GDC align." I think we've scratched out everything ahead of that.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 40 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I'm taking advantage of that to get a little eating done, and maybe we can have a chance to look at the backside this time.</p>

                            <p class="tech"><b>124 44 24 Mattingly:</b> Hank, there's one other thing I'd like to comment on before I forget it.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 44 29 Hartsfield:</b> Go ahead.</p>
                            <p class="tech"><b>124 44 33 Mattingly:</b> That's the cockpit temperature. I've been noticing a little gauge, and it (laughter) - it doesn't ever move. I think it's got a - I think it's plugged into a dummy load somewhere. But the cockpit temperature does, in fact, change quite a bit. And on the way out, in PTC with the three of us in here, it never really got cool enough even for people as warmblooded as Charlie and I. And we were wondering, you know, gee, if it was like that in PTC, what was it going to he like when we got in orbit. And the first day in orbit there, it was - it really was kind of hot and stuffy. And I don't know when it got cool, but last night it was nice and cool. And, in fact, I woke up this morning because I was cold. That was the reason I woke up. And in the past, I've had a hard time sleeping sometimes, because it was warm. I don't know whether that's a - that's caused by going to the 60-circular orbit, or whether that's caused by having only one body to take care of in here, instead of three. But it was very obvious. Unfortunately, we'd get a chance to - I couldn't tell you yesterday. I was wearing a suit, and so it was never really comfortable most of the day. Maybe when John and Charlie get back, we'll notice again, and see if it gets hot again.</p>

And that's the one that shows this ribbon of material; looks like a flow front laying down in all this kind of - kind of hilly and pitted material, and it runs right on up, and there's a whole bunch of these little parallel lines right next to the rim on this big crater in Mandel'shtam. And they run right down in there. Let's see, I have nothing to do until AOS. Okay. Except play.</p>
                              <p class="obcm"><b>125 21 41 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay, we're now at - 35, maybe a little f/4, [garble] 206. We've passed Mandel'shtam. We're going for - Konstantinov - must be that guy.</p>
                              <p class="obcm"><b>125 22 14 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay. Frame number 21 [AS16-120-19203] is of Konstantinov. And a apparent ridge of mountains that runs out to the north of there, I'll take a picture of that. And that's frame number 22 [AS16-120-19204] taken looking north from Konstantinov in what appears from here to be a very subtle topographic high, and that may or may not be the case.</p>
                              <p class="obcm"><b>125 22 53 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay, coming up here on - here comes Mendeleev.</p>
                              <p class="obcm"><b>125 23 14 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> All this material on the back here has the same conglomerate mixture. Look at that - Hey, look at that. Okay, there's two at f/5.6, [AS16-120-19205 and AS16-120-19206] and we'll take two more at - that was at 1/125, and we'll take two more at 1/250 [AS16-120-19207 and AS16-120-19208]. I'll draw this on the map. That's in the area between Mandel'shtam and Mendeleev. And the reason for taking the frames was this - this beautiful flow that - flow front pattern that comes along here; and it runs right down through a crater right on up the side and out.</p>
                              <p class="obcm"><b>125 24 16 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> And the more I look at this material, the more I see it has an awful lot of these little flow pockets in it. There are a lot of collapse features like - it looks - I would say a whole large area may have collapsed. You see relatively large numbers of small craters and a generally undulating pattern that covers this entire area. And we're almost up to Mendeleev now, and the material looks a little smoother. It looks like I've got some smooth material that's kind of filled in with a little rougher material. And it looks like, as I look down at it, that - what is in fact smooth just doesn't have as many of those little craters in it. But that's not really the case. The dark stuff has more craggly kind of craters and more linear furrows.</p>
                              <p class="obcm"><b>125 25 24 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> And here's a picture straight down that ought to illustrate both kinds, if I don't get too much window in it. We're coming up now on Schuster. Schuster doesn't look particularly different than anything else. This whole area over here to the north of Schuster - is just like all this back materiel. It's got craters in it. I have the distinct impression that the small-crater population is less. And the larger craters are all subdued. They have no significant rims to speak of. And maybe the real big ones have mud pies in the bottom, and the mud pies all have little holes in it. You'd swear that bubbled up and just went pop, and all the little bubbles burst, and they collapsed and are very thick. This is typical.</p>
                              <p class="obcm"><b>125 26 28 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> I'm taking a frame now. Okay, that's frame number 28 [sic - probably means 27] on magazine Victor, and it's looking down into one of these typical cone craters. I'd say the depth to diameter is about one-half. There are a few of these bright ray craters on the floor of Mendeleev, but actually remarkably few. And the ones that I see - don't seem to me to be particularly different.</p> <a name="125_27" </a>
                                <p class="ed">[Lunar Rev 27 begins at 125 27.]</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 28 05 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay, the large craters on the floor of Mendeleev and the crater chain are coming up. And here's one of these pretty little gums that has a -</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 28 22 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> A little slump of material that runs out in the crater. The crater chain comes down and doesn't appear to be unusual, and this one place has a little tail that runs out. It runs out into the floor, and there's nothing to say about it except it's very textured, but so is the ineri - inside of the crater chain. As I look down into the one that's cut off, I can see again a whole lot of evidence of - bands and flows and things that - just took a picture, that's number 28 of the slump area in the northwest corner of Mendeleev. And you see all those striations that run up there that all look twisted and like they kind of draped and mantled itself over there. I don't see any flow front connected with it, though.</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 29 44 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> And we're pressing right along. I guess the next little guy we'll come to will be - Vetchinkin should be this one. All right.</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 30 05 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Oh, maybe that's still - I'd swear the general impression I have of this back side is that it has a much harder surface on it. And I don't really know why. I'm looking now at - I think I'm looking at Green. And on the northern end of it - north - again we see a lot of material that seems to be striations and streaks that go down over the sides. There's slightly different albedos. Almost everything up here is just a subtle tone of albedo change. But everywhere you see an albedo change, there is, in fact, a nice demarcation that goes with it. And I'm going to get one here that's on the crater rim.</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 31 04 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> That picture is number 30 and it is just to the west of - of Green. I'll have to stop here for a minute and see if I can get a better focus on these binocs or find out what's fogging them. Oh, somebody put their finger on it. Oh, my, Casper, you've done it again.</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 31 51 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> I thought I had a bad eye on it; wasn't about to admit it. Somebody's put their finger on it.</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 32 24 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> That does help. One should remember to use good optics. Okay, what have I got in the Flight Plan? AOS here at 48. Okay. I can look north from - Let's see - I need about an f/11 here. Oh, no. Last picture may have been out of focus a bit. Oh, look at that little beauty. Isn't that pretty?</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 33 07 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Okay, those are two pictures, numbers 30 and 31, taken north at about 125 degrees, so that's - Well, what are those craters' names?</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 33 33 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> And I can't tell what they are. They're off my map here. Here comes King in all its beauty and splendor. This time I'm not going to get trapped looking down inside it except for one little look - now that I got the binocs cleaned off. Beautiful!. Big improvement!</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 34 04 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> The things that look like outcrops in the northern flow walls - got all these little fingers, these little white things that stick out there. And I don't know that I really see outcrops.</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 34 20 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> Oh!</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 34 44 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> What I do see are the same old globs of material that cast shadows - that are just like the ones on the central peak. The dark material in there does seem to be mantling over the top of the white. There's no question in my mind about that. And it forms a lava - let's say it forms a pool, and the dark material does in fact lay right on top of that bright white stuff. Well, let's see if we can look out to the north here and catch some more of that line of things that runs out of there. Well, there's an interesting thing; let's see what that is. Holy smokes! Ahhhh! Beautiful</p>
                                <p class="obcm"><b>125 35 34 Mattingly (CM onboard):</b> That's frame 34, and that's on this big crater to the north of King, and it's a beautiful little crater wall in the side of this big crater, and it's got some black material that looks like it's just oozed out of the bottom of it. It's running right down the side. It's really something. The first - it's really dark material on really white sides. Haven't seen anything like that anywhere up here so far. You see little splotches of material, but this is just really spectacular. This is not slumping - Let me verify that I got the right setting on that.
