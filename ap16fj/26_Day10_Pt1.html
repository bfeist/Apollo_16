We now show Apollo 16 at a distance of 187,791 nautical miles away from the Earth. And now travelling at a speed of 3,750 feet per second relative to the Earth. In the Mission Control Center we've had a change of shift. Our Flight Director at this time is Phil Shaffer and filling the Capcom position at this time Henry Hartsfield. We'll stand by now with the line open awaiting for a crew callup. We're at 237 hours, 30 minutes [212:44:] Ground Elapsed Time and this is Apollo Control, Houston, continuing to monitor.</p>
      <p class="ed">[The PAO, Mission Control and Crew are using the updated GET, intended to align events to the Flight Plan. At this stage in the flight, the difference from the actual GET is 24 hours, 45 minutes and 52 seconds.

      <p class="tech"><b>212 45 10 Hartsfield:</b> Good morning. Is everybody wide awake and feeling great this morning?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 45 19 Mattingly:</b> You even gave us an extra hour.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 45 35 Hartsfield:</b> We're coming up on antenna switch, and I think the comm is a little bad; but, right off the bat we'd like for you to remain in PTC.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 45 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 45 50 Hartsfield:</b> And we'd also like for you to take the Up Telemetry Command switch Off for three seconds. We've got that same commanding problem we had during coast out to the Moon.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 46 14 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It's Off and back to Normal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 46 17 Hartsfield:</b> Roger.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 46 45 Hartsfield:</b> That cured up the commanding problem.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>212 47 12 Mattingly:</b> Hank, before we copy the Flight Plan updates, do you want us to start on the 236-hour item?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 47 22 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We'd like for you to get started on the postsleep checklist. And, rather than read you a bunch of things to start with, I think I'll just remind you of a few things to catch you up. I've got a list of them here. While you're doing that, if we could get somebody to pull the Gamma Ray boom in, I'd appreciate it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 47 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay. You want that all the way in?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 47 51 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. And you'll need your Logic Powers to get that in.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 47 53 Mattingly:</b> All righty. Thank you, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 48 12 Hartsfield:</b> And we'd like to get the S-Band Normal Mode switch to Voice.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 48 24 Mattingly:</b> That already is voicing.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 48 27 Hartsfield:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 48 32 Duke:</b> We couldn't talk to you if we weren't in Voice, Pete.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 48 40 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We were in Down Voice Backup there and then Command in Normal.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 48 50 Mattingly:</b> I got you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 49 23 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, for your information, we've scrubbed the corona window calibration and the Skylab contamination photos.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 49 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 49 35 Hartsfield:</b> And we're gonna stay at PTC right up to the Mid-Course 5. And if you're - can get to it now, Ken, I'd like to get the Image Motion, On; and the Mapping Camera, On. And, then give me barber pole plus two.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 49 58 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Just a second. Let me catch up here. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 50 46 Mattingly:</b> Hank, you say you want the Mapping Camera Image Motion, On; and then the cameras on [garble].</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>212 50 57 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative, Ken. We want to get the Image Motion, On; the Mapping Camera, On; barber pole plus two. And we're gonna leave it shut up in there. We're just running the film out.</p>
      <p class="pao"><b>Public Affairs Officer:</b> This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 237 hours, 37 minutes [212:50] Ground Elapsed Time.

      <p class="tech"><b>212 53 10 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Mid-Course 5 will be about 4 feet per second. It'll be an RCS burn.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>212 55 09 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, Ken. We just want to run the film out and leave the door shut. We want to get the Image Motion, On; Mapping Camera, On; and barber pole plus 2. That gives us a higher speed.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>214 42 28 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. In regard to the Mapping Camera, they want to check the interference. Inspect the periphery of the Mapping Camera and Laser Altimeter for any evidence of interference. The last attraction on that thing was nominal ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 42 44 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 42 45 Hartsfield:</b> ... so it's kind of puzzling, you know. It started out real slow and each retraction it got faster.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 42 53 Mattingly:</b> [Garble] it's just getting warmed up.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 42 55 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Some of the things they suggest you might look for is - around the cable, there, between the Mapping Camera and the shelf, is there any damage to the cable? Clearance in that area of the cable? And whether the cable is caught or curled ... </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 43 15 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Now, that cable is located on the - on the plus-X side of the camera over on the - towards the A quad, is that correct?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 43 28 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 43 31 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 44 05 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. We want to know if that cable is caught or curled or is it smooth, you know, like it's supposed to? That's between the - what I would call the top of the Mapping Camera and the bay, there, by the handhold.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 44 20 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I know the area. I'm not sure we're gonna have enough light to see down in there in the EVA attitudes but we'll take a look at it. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 42 34 Hartsfield:</b> And we'd like to know a little something about the cuckoo door. You know which one that is? The little white door that goes over the stellar lens? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 44 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I won't be able to tell you much about that in the retracted position, either. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 44 51 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. If possible, we'd like for you to lift up that door and inspect the clearance between the hinge and the top of the Mapping Camera, and look for any scrape marks on the camera or on the door and any evidence of twisting or bending of the stellar lens glare shield.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 11 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 13 Hartsfield:</b> Any question on that part with reference to the Mapping Camera, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 20 Mattingly:</b> Say again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 21 Hartsfield:</b> Did you have any question about any of those Mapping Camera items?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 26 Mattingly:</b> No, sir.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 30 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. In regard to the Pan Camera, we'd like for you to look at the exposure sensor. And that's the ones that's immediately to the left of the lens barrel.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 49 Hartsfield:</b> And we need Auto on the High Gain.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 55 Young:</b> Got it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 45 58 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. In - In regard to that automatic exposure control sensor there, Ken, what we're looking for is foreign objects or contamination.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 46 13 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 46 14 Hartsfield:</b> And the little thermal shield that goes around the periphery of the lens barrel, we want to inspect that for contamination, and also, the lens barrel itself. And we're really looking for contamination really on all of the Pan Camera, and the same goes for the V over H sensor.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 46 36 Mattingly:</b> All right.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 46 39 Hartsfield:</b> And just to refresh your memory, the V over H sensor is the one that's on the right side that's got the little hood on it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 46 47 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 46 52 Hartsfield:</b> And for the Gamma Ray boom, what we'd like to do is inspect the cover for any damage. You know, that thing has closed a couple of times and - or the boom has retracted all the way a couple of times and a couple of times it hasn't. So - so we're expecting that the Gamma Ray boom right now is about 6 inches out; but we're not sure. We'd like for you to look at the cover, and if it's not fully closed, give us an estimate of how far it's open. Full open is about 134 degrees. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 47 24 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I'm familiar with that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 47 26 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. If the cover is partially open ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 47 27 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Is Brad [?] taking bets on where it is?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 47 38 Hartsfield:</b> He's not - he's not too brave. He'll bet you a cup of coffee it's about 6 inches.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 47 48 Mattingly:</b> Okay. I heard that. He's on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 47 51 Hartsfield:</b> He said he takes it. And we'd like to know how far that rail protrudes through the bind there, and if you can see any obstructions to retractions, you know, like the harness, or the guides, or the loom cable fingers, proximity switches, any of those things - report them.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 48 10 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 48 12 Hartsfield:</b> And that's all we want to know, Ken, other than any other things you might pick up from looking around out there.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 48 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay; do you require any kind of documentation on this?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 48 30 Hartsfield:</b> I guess we'll have to take verbal comment.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 48 37 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 48 48 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, we'd like to vent the battery compart - compartment to 1 volt on your meter. Stop it at 1 volt.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 49 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay; well, all righty.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 49 04 Young:</b> It drops like a stone; I don't know if we can do that or not. We'll try it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 49 17 Hartsfield:</b> Give it a try.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 49 43 Young:</b> We got 1.2 on there; you want to press and try for 1?</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>214 50 01 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 50 49 Hartsfield:</b> 16, Houston. He kind of would like to know if that's the first time you've noticed that Bat vent or bat - battery compartment pressure above 1.5 volts?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 51 17 Mattingly:</b> John says that when they did the first charges they had to take it and vent it, but the charges I did I never saw it above 1.5.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 51 27 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy. We'll probably be asking you for a check of that here in a little while, just to make sure it's not charging way on up there again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 51 35 Young:</b> Okay; we reported the other times that we vented it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 51 40 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, John.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 52 00 Hartsfield:</b> And, 16; Houston. I'm gonna go off the loop a couple of minutes; Phil will cover for me.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 52 08 Mattingly:</b> That's not fair.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 52 12 Hartsfield:</b> But it's necessary.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>214 52 18 Mattingly:</b> Now you understand.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>215 05 32 Mattingly:</b> Hank, I don't really know what's going on with our antenna. It's - I get you the best signal strength by going to Manual and Narrow, and every time we switch to either Auto or Reacq, why, it seems to break - break some kind of beam switch lock, or something, and we've tried going to Manual and Wide and working in through Reacq and then bringing it down and things, and that doesn't help any. Would there be any future in trying the secondary electronics, the servos?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 05 XX Mattingly (onboard):</b> Think it's in the antenna electronics itself. Which one you going to fix? </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 06 07 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; INCO says we're just right on the line there. Why don't we just leave it in Manual and Narrow. </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 06 17 Mattingly:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 17 Young (onboard):</b> All right, who's the guy stole my sugar?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 19 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Oh-oh. I didn't know you were going to eat that. I 'm sorry.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 24 Duke (onboard):</b> It's already reconstituted.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 26 Mattingly (onboard):</b> Was it? I don't think that's a purely reconstituted, what's in there. There's a - that - that hasn't reconstituted.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 34 Duke (onboard):</b> No.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 35 Young (onboard):</b> Well, Charlie, I don't need it. Here's another one.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 38 Mattingly (onboard):</b> And it ain't reconstituted. That's all I threw in there, honest.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 42 Duke (onboard):</b> [Garble].</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 43 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I did not, Charlie. But you may reconstitute this one.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 49 Duke (onboard):</b> That [garble] reconstituted.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 06 58 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You know, I think we - you know, I planned to use this bag because I thought we had about 3 days on it. Now, I'm gonna throw it away, and we got ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 07 04 Hartsfield:</b> And, Ken, I'd appreciate it if from time to time, you'd just give me a idea of where you are in the checklist.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 07 12 Mattingly:</b> We is at the eat period.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 07 14 Hartsfield:</b> Hey, that's a good plan.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 07 15 Duke (onboard):</b> Ken, I don't think we ought to stow that big bag; that's not hardly much in that big one. We ought to do the small one.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 07 20 Mattingly (onboard):</b> That's what I was thinking about; putting this into something else.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 07 22 Duke (onboard):</b> That's right. We need this; we don't need that.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 07 24 Mattingly:</b> We'll be ready to start in on that checklist in probably about 10 minutes or so; but it just didn't seem like it was proper to go ahead and press on the rest of the day without stopping for something.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 07 39 Hartsfield:</b> I agree with you, and I guess we'd better terminate that Battery B Charge and keep an eye on that thing. If it gives - gets above 3, give us a call. And also -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 07 53 Mattingly:</b> Okay; why don't you call us back in about 30 minutes and ask us to look at it, because that's not the kind of position where we can keep an eye on it without making a conscious effort at it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 08 01 Hartsfield:</b> Okay; we'll give you a reminder, and if it's above 3 or in that neighborhood, we're gonna want to vent it again back down to 1.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 08 06 Young (onboard):</b> There you go, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 08 12 Duke:</b> Okay; do you want to vent it now. It's at 2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 08 16 Hartsfield:</b> Negative. We want to see if it'll stabilize.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 08 22 Mattingly:</b> Okay; you've got the - the Bat B Charge is terminated, and we'll watch the battery's compartment pressure.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 08 31 Mattingly (onboard):</b> (Singing) Do-dee-do-dee-dah-dum. Let's see what's a good - We got one more of those plastic bags - overwrap bags in - in your TSB, John. Haven't we?</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 08 44 Young (onboard):</b> I don't remember seeing it there yesterday.</p>
      <p class="obcm"><b>215 08 46 Mattingly (onboard):</b> I don't remember seeing it either, but ... </p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 08 46 Hartsfield:</b> While you're eating there, I'll tell you a little local sports news. The Astros have won seven in a row now, and they are tied for first place in the division.</p>

      <p class="obcm"><b>215 09 33 Mattingly (onboard):</b> You remember that - that plastic bag like we [garble] the last day of the LM - threw the LM? There were two of those left over.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>215 10 27 Hartsfield:</b> 16, if it's convenient, could we get a check on the Bat C voltage?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 10 41 Mattingly:</b> Okay. It's 36-1/2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 10 43 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. Copy 36.5.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 10 56 Mattingly:</b> Okay, Hank. And John stuck the eyeball right closer to the meter, and it's 1.9 instead of 2.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 11 03 Hartsfield:</b> Roger, 1.9.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 12 23 Young:</b> Okay. We're going to vent the battery - the bat compartment again, it's 2 and -</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 12 43 Hartsfield:</b> Okay. If you want to try a vent, go ahead and see if you can stop it at 1.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 12 50 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 12 51 Mattingly:</b> What - What's wrong if we go below 1, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 12 56 Hartsfield:</b> Well, the problem is there, Ken, if it's - at 1 volt, we're - at 1.5 volt, we're roughly equal to cabin pressure in there and, if you go much below 1 and we do have a battery that's venting, you could lose the battery, if it goes all the way to vacuum.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 13 18 Mattingly:</b> Okay. And that's the only problem?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 13 21 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. In other words, if the - if the battery - a battery has vented and the - and the vent doesn't reseal - and it - and it's not resealed, if you go to vacuum, the electrolyte couldn't go - go out of it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 13 35 Mattingly:</b> Roger. I understand that. That's the only problem, though. Is that correct? It won't affect the other batteries?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 13 40 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative. It shouldn't affect the other batteries.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 13 45 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you. We'll try it for 1 again.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 14 04 Mattingly:</b> Okay, it's reading 1.2 - about 1.3, I guess. We'll leave it at that for a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 14 53 Duke:</b> Can y'all see the Bat Charger current down there, Hank?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 15 01 Hartsfield:</b> That's affirmative, and it's reading zero now, Charlie.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>215 15 06 Duke:</b> Okay. When I started Bat B charge, I was looking at Bat Bus B, and we got a negative amp - looked like to me a negative amps, off-scale, low on Bat B, and then I went to Bat Charger, but that should - but that didn't look right to me, so I stopped. And then I went to Bat Charger and started it and - again, and the bat charger current went up to about 2, which - or so, which looked nominal. The only question was that it looked like a reverse current or something, and - I guess that is true, isn't it, though, when you reverse current into a battery to charge it?</p>

Each battery has 20 cells, much like a car battery but with check valves rather than caps for each cell. Right now we don't believe that that we have a problem with any one of these cells, but we're exploring that kind of possibility with the pressure built up. It could indicate the possibility of one of the cells - one of the batteries, could be venting. I repeat, we have no reason to believe that right now, but we're exploring that with the crew of Apollo 16. The principle concern does not deal with battery capability, but rather to make sure that battery gas would not be relieving into the cabin, Entry can be safely accomplished on only one of the 3 batteries.

      <p class="tech"><b>218 40 12 Young:</b> Okay, right down now.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>218 42 52 Mattingly:</b> Cabin shows about 1. I'm going to open it a little more; that can help it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 04 Young:</b> How's your keying, Ken?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 4B 05 Mattingly:</b> I'm fine.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 06 Young:</b> Good.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 08 Mattingly:</b> It's a lot better when you get the cabin depressurized.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 40 Mattingly:</b> Well, I'm still showing about three-quarters.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 47 Young:</b> Don't - don't let that screw go in there, Ken.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 49 Mattingly:</b> Oh, I tried.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 52 Young:</b> Did it go in?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 43 55 Mattingly:</b> It looks like it went in here, I can't tell.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 44 33 Mattingly:</b> Okay, looks like we're down pretty low.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 44 40 Young:</b> Okay, verify suit pressure stable, 3.5 to 4.0.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>218 44 58 Young:</b> Okay. Mine, too. EVA station pressure gage 100 to 500. No tone.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 03 Mattingly:</b> Okay, still setting on 300, and no warning tone.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 06 Young:</b> Okay, panel 3 S-Band Aux TV to TV.</p>

      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 11 Young:</b> I'm going to Intercomm/PTT.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 13 Mattingly:</b> Oh, let's see. I'm not sure that cabin's really down out of that pazhan [?] region. How about reading me that - that step again when I get the hatch?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 31 Young:</b> It doesn't matter right now? Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 34 Mattingly:</b> If you can get it on, fine; if not, don't worry about it.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 43 Young:</b> Okay.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 48 Mattingly:</b> I can't read the parallax in the gage. It looks like it must be just about down though.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 52 Young:</b> Okay, well let's ask the ground. Houston, what do you show the cabin pressure?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 45 54 Hartsfield:</b> Roger; we're showing you 0.1.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 46 00 Mattingly:</b> That ought to be enough, huh?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 46 02 Young:</b> Okay. Yeah, that's enough. Okay, I'm going to Intercom/PTT.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 46 08 Mattingly:</b> And, Houston, is that low enough pressure to turn the TV on?</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 46 32 Mattingly:</b> Henry, did you read ...</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 46 33 Hartsfield:</b> Roger. We copy. Press on with the - with the - turning it on.</p>
      <p class="tech"><b>218 46 38 Mattingly:</b> Okay. Thank you, sir.</p> <a name="218_46_57"></a>
